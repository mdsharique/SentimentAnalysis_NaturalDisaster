StuOnTour,11/22/2016,"Tokyo here - woke up just before 6AM with some pretty intense shaking, the strongest I've ever felt. Seemed to last forever. All ok now though. Usually just try to go back to sleep but my gf made me get up and put my jacket on. Too much excitement for this early. My friends family from Fukushima is visiting her, apparently they got up, turned on the TV for a few minutes then went back to sleep haha.

Edit: I'm from a country with no earthquake risk so what could possibly be considered a routine earthquake to Japanese, to me feels like a big one and it's a terrifying thing to wake up to.

Edit 2: strongest I've felt in a year and a half*. Stop trying to one up me on who has felt the biggest earthquake."
Mr-Thumpasaurus,11/22/2016,"Just wanted to weigh in on this one - Sounds like it is the ""spent rod cooling pool"".... AKA where they stick the mostly depleted rods to keep the radiation contained. Those spent rods don't have nearly the amount of power output as the actual plant, especially since they are significantly sub-critical (the nuclear reaction is no longer self-sustaining). It will take them a long time (weeks) before they could boil off all of the water in the pool and even consider reaching temperatures above 100 C (nuclear reactors operate around 300 C). Plenty of time to just replace a pump. Worst case they would just have to truck some extra water in to keep it cool, though it could be a bit of an inconvenience to have boiling SLIGHTLY-irradiated water coming off the pool.

Fukushima II has been offline since the 2011 disaster "
forty_two_monkeys,11/22/2016,You can see the water retracting on the NHK live feed now. Does not look good at all
Nukemarine,11/22/2016,"Currently, I'm about 320 km south of Fukushima and felt about 2 to 3 minutes of shaking in my apartment. The last large one in March 2011 was the only one that lasted longer that I experienced.

There's a three meter tsunami warning which is serious, but nothing like the 10m that hit five years ago. There is an evacuation warning for Fukushima area though on TV.

Edit #1: Current USGS page on this incident. Thanks to /u/CSR_Enthusiast.

Edit #2: Downgraded to a 6.9 by USGS, but evacuation order is still in effect. Japan news still reports it as 7.3 magnitude and damage level of 5-.

Edit #3: Youtube stream of NHK broadcast with English tranlator

Edit #4: Reddit Live Thread

I'll stop updating this with edits as /u/svenne is more active with this."
[deleted],11/22/2016,"Could this be an aftershock?

I'm not the earthquake guy but I wouldn't be surprised if the giant earthquake has giant aftershocks."
seis-matters,11/22/2016,"Reported as shallow and offshore right now, does not look close to the trench though so hopefully it did not have too much uplift, a.k.a. tsunami generating displacement of the water column. There is a local tsunami alert out for Japan.

You can report the shaking you experienced to USGS here.Edit: USGS just changed their model drastically to prefer a normal fault. Perhaps the first models had some odd data or this earthquake could have had an odd rupture not easily captured by initial modeling.

Preferred fault mechanism is now normal, where the fault sides are moving apart from one another rather than sliding past (strike-slip) or towards each other (thrust). Depth remains very shallow after later calculations so this looks like it was in the upper plate instead of the downgoing Pacific plate.

Here is a map showing the location of today's earthquake hypocenter relative to the 2011 M9.1 hypocenter, but keep in mind that the 2011 earthquake ruptured over a large extent and occurred deeper on the subduction zone interface.

A couple moderate M5 aftershocks so far, and more will be expected over the next week or two for an earthquake of this size. There is a possibility that this M6.9 could lead to a larger earthquake, but there is no way to know for sure as earthquake prediction and operational earthquake forecasting are not currently possible."
codeverity,11/22/2016,"Thank you for the information about the tsunami. I'm in Canada but I got an alert on my phone and my first thought was concern about how bad the tsunami would be (for people in Japan, obviously, no danger here on the West Coast!)"
seis-matters,11/22/2016,"It is tricky to know what the effects will be in those first few minutes, but offshore and shallow are not generally a good combination if you are worried about tsunamis. You need that water displacement, which is why I was waiting for the initial focal mechanisms to be calculated and published by USGS. It shows what the orientation of the fault could be, so when I saw it was not a thrust fault I relaxed a bit. I did not expect the focal mechanism to change so drastically from strike-slip to normal though; that was unusual."
Keg_of_St_Anky,11/22/2016,Wife and I staying about 30 floors up in Shinjuku hotel. Swayed for a solid 3-4 minutes. First real earthquake for either of us.
2rio2,11/22/2016,Shinjuku skyscrapers are made to sway that much in quakes. Doing their job then.
celestiOn,11/22/2016,"Exactly the same thing happened five years ago - New Zealand experienced a major earthquake, then Japan experienced one a short while later. Can somebody knowledgeable fill me in on whether this is linked or just a coincidence?"
seis-matters,11/22/2016,"It will take much more work than that to determine if there is really a connection between the two recent large earthquakes, and I have not heard of anything published on the 2011 NZ earthquake being connected to the 2011 Japan earthquake in the five years since those occurred. Remember that if the 2011 M6.3 earthquake had not been right underneath Christchurch, it likely would have gone unnoticed by the world both in the human sense and the physical sense. We have many M6s, and about 15 moderate to large (M7+) earthquakes every year too."

This will be the only U.S. National Tsunami Warning center message for this event unless additional information becomes available."
ConceptualLogic,11/22/2016,"Can someone explain to me what the reported size of the tsunami means? Does it mean the size of the wave is going to be 3 meters ( 10 feet )? Or does it mean everything within 3 meters of sea level will be effected? I mean, we get 10 foot waves in NJ during a tropical storm and it doesn't do that much damage.."
LascielCoin,11/22/2016,"They are predicting the wave to be 3 meters high. That is 3 meters above the sea level, and is nothing like the waves you experience in storms. Those only hit the shore, while a tsunami is a huge amount of water moving inland and destroying everything in its path.

Check out this video for an example."
Doubtless_Lemons,11/22/2016,I'm in Tokyo at the moment and my hotel had a gentle sway going on for a few minutes
Hiddencamper,11/22/2016,"This is late but I'm a nuclear engineer.

Being 5 years out after the Fukushima accident, there is insufficient decay heat for corium melting to occur at any of the Daiichi units.

The main concern is if water begins to boil, the steam can become a mechanism by which radioactive material can go airborne and escape the plant into the atmosphere.

This would likely take a very long time to happen. Right now they've been injecting around 1.5 m3 of water per hour, which is a very low flow rate. There is likely very little to no concern about the site now, as there is insufficient decay heat to cause any damage or create hydrogen."
made_of_cuteness,11/22/2016,I've read that Fukushima could have been prevented if emergency generators cooling the reactors had been stored in waterproof housing or at higher elevations. Do you know if these safety measures been implemented in the other reactors in the last 5 years?
Hiddencamper,11/22/2016,"This isn't as simple as ""store generators higher"".First, the generators are massive train sized engines that are permanently installed and anchored into a thick concrete base mat to make them seismically safe. It's not like a portable little generac you can plug into. These are huge engines with lots of wiring, controls, pumps and pipes, and can't be easily relocated.Fukushima actually had 3 air cooled emergency generators which were already much further elevated/inland and were not affected by the tsunami. One of these was used to save units 5/6. One was out for maintenance. And the last one had no place to send its power to as the busses at units 1-4 were submerged.The busses, breakers, and switchgear being underwater was the real issue. Even though they had power available through portable generators and air cooled generators, these units had no way to accept that power and transmit it to plant loads. This was the real cause of the accident. It means that even if you string power lines to the plant you wouldn't be able to save it using electricity."
AskMeAnythingIAnswer,11/22/2016,"Reactor Fukushima 3 insecure.

Edit: Water cooling system has stopped. Pool may be sufficient to cool. 27° at the moment.

Edit 2: Reactor 3 stopped operation.

Edit 3: 28.7° reached in reactor 3 (spent nuclear fuel). 65° MAX, strong concern that earthquake has stopped it. slowly rising.

Edit 4: TEPCO say they could restart cooling system.

Edit 5: #3 still warming.

Edit 6: pool pump resuming operation. thank god (29.5° now over ~90min)

badger4710,11/22/2016,"Temp in the spent fuel pool rising at ~0.2°C per hour. Expect to have 7 days to fix it. Shouldn't be a huge issue, but definitely something to keep an eye on as the tsunamis start to hit.EDIT: Pumps restarted"
Black_D,11/22/2016,Scary thing is the 2011 megathrust earthquake had M7.3 foreshock two days before the main M9..
DivingSiren,11/22/2016,"Teacher in Fukushima here. Not the /best/ way to wake up this morning. We've got the news switched on and all of my mates directly on the coast seem to be safely evacuated.

Knock on wood this isn't a foreshock but damn if this didn't give me some flashbacks to 2011.

Seems that last time NZ had a big earthquake, we had to follow suit and now it has happened again."
nuj03,11/22/2016,Staying at Tokyo. I am staying on the 21st floor and felt the quake. Never in my life I was this scared. Immediately called my folks that I am alright. Be safe everyone who is in Japan.
laothunder,11/22/2016,"I'm at a school near the coast in Miyagi.

They put the students on the second floor and cancelled classes today.

Alarms still going off and all the teachers are alert and planning what to do."
JoshCos,11/22/2016,"CNN are reporting it's been downgraded to a 6.9.

NHK (Channel 507 if you're in the UK and have SKY) are still warning of the imminent tsunami: NHK Screenshot"
azurephoenix_,11/22/2016,"Serious question. Why is the Fukushima radioactive waste being stored so close to the Ocean? What happens if the waves break over the plant, and cripple it even further? I've seen little explanation of how they're preventing more contamination going into the ocean?"
LoupGarouGirl,11/22/2016,"Fukushima here. I live right on the coast and it was quite scary. It's my first real earthquake experience and I'm still quite shaken up. Half my town has evacuated, but I'm far inland enough that I've not been evacuated. But holy cow, what a way to wake up!"
Laf1,11/22/2016,Japanese here. Woke up at 6am due to the earthquake but got back to the bed right after that. It's become a part of our normal life in Japan... And I'm proud of the fact that we haven't had victims yet
lmhTimberwolves,11/22/2016,I felt it all the way from western Tokyo. It was like being in a turbulent airplane!
songbolt,11/22/2016,"In Gunma Prefecture on second floor in bed, that was kind of a fun one (after I assured myself the building would stay intact). Started out small, ""just another small one"", then it got bigger, ""whoa what's goin' on, (nervous) haha"", then it kept going, ""dang I think this is the biggest I've felt since 2014!""Anything more than a small tremor wakes me up.Was interesting to hear the windows rattling. kind of a hollow plastic sound. The creaking of the wooden walls made me wonder how the building's constructed (and yeah, winter, no insulation, I wish I'd picked a concrete dormitory).My university had an earthquake drill yesterday."
Servebotfrank,11/22/2016,"My brother lives in Ibaraki (Right next to Fukushima) and he said it barely impacted his day at all and he still had to go to work. He says that no one even seems remotely inconvenienced by it and if the news is making it sound scary, it's not.So I'm happy on that account."
Addfwyn,11/22/2016,"Tokyo resident here, it didn't feel exceptionally strong here it just lasted a really long time. Comparatively the 2011 earthquake was the most terrifying thing I had lived through. Everything in Tokyo is pretty much fine and there seems to be no serious risk of serious personal injury on a national level. Didn't even experience any power outages here, though my gas safety mechanism was tripped.Everything in Tokyo seems to be operating normally now, including trains and other public transportation."
ForestCreatures,11/22/2016,"I'm in Miyagi prefecture, and everyone I've talked to felt it (except for one person who slept through it). Everyone just noticed how it seemed to last so long! For those that were effected by the big one, it caused some anxiety."
Modoger,11/22/2016,Just heard that the water cooling system at the reactor has stopped. This is not good.
fang_xianfu,11/22/2016,"News just said it was the spent fuel pool cooling system that stopped. At 6:10am the pool was at 28.7C and the maximum tolerance for the temperature in the pool is 65C. The temperature will take around 7 days to reach 65C at the current rate of increase.

They have plenty of time to fix it and there is no danger to the reactor yet."
SticklerX,11/22/2016,"It will take 7 days before the pool even reaches 65 degrees C, which is an internal limit. The water will continue to cool, though to a lesser and lesser degree until 100c."
1E+20,11/22/2016,"Tepco stated that the cooling system for Reactor 3 is not functioning. They also said that the water system that is currently there is enough to keep the spent fuel cool for the time being.

kuro_snow,11/22/2016,"i had message and call some friends in japan. one of my friends happen to replied, and He replied to me very fast with ""Tsunami comes to friends who live in the Tohoku region of Japan, so contact us to escape early and everyone is running away to the mountains. Tokyo is okay. Thank you! ️""I'm glad they are well but i'm also hoping everyone else in japan is safe and sound"
Copps,11/22/2016,"Holy shit. The owners of the Pokemon Go game did a special event encouraging tourists to visit Fukishima this week. There's a lot of people from around the world who travelled there for it, what crazy timing for this to happen there. Hope they are all safe."
AkaHisui,11/22/2016,Hope you guys in Japan are alright :L Sending prayers from Taiwan
HaydenGalloway10,11/22/2016,The earthquake was twice the depth and less strong than the 2011 one. It was also closer to shore. 2 hours has passed with no waves above 2 meters. They are being cautious and keeping the evacuation in effect but at this point it looks like there will not be significant damage.
MMoney2112,11/22/2016,Good thing the wave is taking a while to get there so people have more time to evacuate
syrielmorane,11/22/2016,"People just can't seem to catch a break. It's not just the tsunamis to worry about, it's the several nuclear plants doting the coastline. Hope there's not another Fukushima."
Usgarden,11/22/2016,"The whole idea of keeping water in tanks at the site of the plant was terrible. Should have been a slow controlled release into the ocean. If they break now, best case is that there's a large amount of radioactive water released into the ocean. Worst case is that it floods and further contaminates the land.The decision to store it was political rather than the best and safest decision from a scientific standpoint."
[deleted],11/22/2016,"Yes, I live in Nagoya and I was awake at 6:00 when the floor started to move under my bed, right, left, right, left.... slowly but for 10 long seconds. Good Japan and I are used to it, the last thing we do is panic, here."
psicopbester,11/22/2016,"It woke me up right when I normally wake up. I had my phone alarm going off, the village alarm going off, and my phone screaming earthquake!!!! all at the same time.I live very close to the epicenter, it was only about 5.4 on land.Small after shocks happened for almost an 40 mins afterwards."
PeekyChew,11/22/2016,"I'm in Tokyo right now, and the shaking woke me up. There was another one yesterday at around the same time that didn't feel that much different, but no one reported on it. There's nothing to worry about."
Xamira,11/22/2016,Woke myself and the wife up. House is pretty old so it swayed considerably with a few aftershocks felt for an hour afterwards (central Chiba). Heading into Tokyo for a meeting now and every train on every line is listed as delayed.
TommyVillain,11/22/2016,"Was awoken by a fist to the face from my girlfriend wild sleeping, then the quake came about two minutes later.She jumped awake and held me in fear as my apartment shook and creaked for minutes after.We both couldn't sleep after…Waiting to see if that was just a small taste of something bigger coming this week..."
SpartanNitro1,11/22/2016,"Hey. I live in Canada and I have no idea how I can directly help, but if there are any Japanese people here who need to call long distance back home to make sure your family is ok, I'll gladly let you use my phone."

Bloogson,11/22/2016,"I'm in vacation with my girlfriend in Tokyo and we woke up to the bed shaking. Lasted about 30 seconds. There was a bunch of commotion outside. Definitely a spooky experience knowing the history of the Fukashima disaster. It was my first earthquake but I immediately knew what was happening.

Sounds like it isn't going to be too serious. I hope it doesn't escalate."
kitium,11/22/2016,"I'm on the 10th floor in a hotel in Tokyo.

And there is was, front centre on BBC ""Breaking News""... the joys of the internet!"
TNF4590,11/22/2016,Why do I feel like Japan has been getting pummeled with disasters as of late?
evotopid,11/22/2016,"My understanding is there are still waves propagating so some areas will still be hit and at this time it is not possible to really say for sure if this was it for the first affected areas or if further waves are coming to those too.In case you are there you should go to higher ground ASAP anyway, even if it is below 3m if you get pulled in you are out of luck."
perhapsis,11/22/2016,"Japan has been incredibly shady about its Fukushima plant and the containment process. As of March earlier this year, over 100,000 people are still displaced from the area. There needs to be greater visibility regarding the status of their nuclear reactors.These reactors should not be built on fault lines."
[deleted],11/22/2016,For people on the west coast of the US who are concerned: You should be. The amount of lies regarding the power plants in Fukushima during the last earthquake will undoubtedly be repeated if there are any issues.I think it's important to remind you all that they brought the monitoring system back online during the previous crisis by daisy chaining car batteries. I'm sure that inspires confidence.

Shit man the great east earthquake was just five years ago,and great Kumamoto earthquake happened like 7 months ago and Tottori earthquake hit just 1 month ago and it was the first big earthquake I've experienced. Plus,study shows that 鬼界(which means demons' world) caldera is kinda active and estimated to kill at least 100 million people. Gotta get the fuck out of my country. Shit is crazy man"
Joxxies,11/22/2016,"You know it's ironic how all these earthquakes are suddenly happening.Obviously, Japan for some time are in the nuclear factory.

anyahatzi,11/22/2016,I just hope this tsunami won't be that devastating as that one back in 2011. I don't get what's happening to the seismic activity? Second earthquake and tsunami for the last two weeks. This is terrifying. Coincidence?

wakato106,11/22/2016,"Is it wrong that I'm immediately worried about the Fukushima power plant, and the environmental + political effects of a tsunami impact on it?Any radiation leak into the ocean from Fukushima would become a mini-Chernobyl for aquatic life, and certainly any media coverage of damage to the reactor would inspire anti-nuclear energy demands from the electorate of various nations.The 2011 tsunami made people more wary about fission even if it's so much better for the environment as a whole. I'm worried about the future of fission energy if Fukushima sustains damage; it could set nations back years, or even decades."
pegothejerk,11/22/2016,"Decades of cleanup costing trillions of yen is what theyre facing from the last accident, that level of cesium has never been seen in ocean waters and generally gets absorbed into the floor, a critical part of the ocean food chain. Id hardly say thats minimal and short lasting effect. (The cesium reached US shores in 2015"
PeekyChew,11/22/2016,"You're completely right about Reddit overreacting. I'm in Tokyo right now and the earthquake was barely stronger than one that happened yesterday, but no one reported on that. The media have just jumped all over it. On Japanese TV they're reporting there's no damage and the tsunami didn't breach sea walls."
zuulbe,11/22/2016,remember 2011 quake of Japan? they predicted low waves there too then it turned to 30 meters. Japan doesn't fuck around now with tsunami warnings and they're right too.
Nukemarine,11/22/2016,The nuclear plant itself held up well to the earthquake and shut down as designed. It lower than recommended walls that led to flooding of its diesel generators to keep the plant and spent rods cool that cause the problems with that plant.
abderrezak31,11/22/2016,"people should go to high places to avoid any tsunami damages, our prayers for you"
KeriEatsSouls,11/22/2016,In Okinawa which is quite far away and won't be affected (unless it affects produce prices or something) but I expect family back home to message me in a panic before too long. I'm assuming they haven't seen the news yet since I have yet to receive any messages.
Nukemarine,11/22/2016,"Yeah, the Tsunami in 2011 was peaked at 40 meters (edit: run up height, the wave height was 13m) and reached almost 10 km inland. That was the most devastating part of that earthquake (despite the world caring only about the nuclear plant disaster). This is estimated to be only 3 meters so yes, that won't be the problem, but the earthquake is strong and hit the same area within a short period of time."
duckfighter,11/22/2016,"This is not just a ""wave"", this is a massive movement of water caused by displacement from the earthquake. Imagine a loudspeaker as large as a skyscraper playing at full volume. You cannot to stop the sound with a small wire. Waves do not care about small thin obstacles, they go right through (beside) them."
v_freak,11/22/2016,"I like to think of it as this. Imagine a normal 3 meter wave across 20 feet of coast is 10 swimming pools worth of water (This is not an accurate example, just a learning example). This does nothing, maybe washing up a few feet up the shore.Now a tsunami is deeper, not higher, than a normal wave. This is because it is formed from the movement of the earths crush underwater. For example if it is 100 times deeper, now that 3 meters of water has 1000 swimming pools of water washing up 100 times further up the shore. Now most of the area close to the coast is 3 meters underwater. Hope that was somewhat easier to understand."
yellowstone10,11/22/2016,"Even in 2011, the problem wasn't earthquake damage to the reactors themselves. It was that the tsunami knocked out the generators designed to keep the cooling water flowing after the reactors shut down. The reactors then overheated. (The generators in question were protected by a 10-meter seawall... that got hit by a 13-meter tsunami.) As long as the cooling systems don't shut down for an extended period, the reactors should be fine."
SirThang,11/22/2016,"Wow, on vacation in Japan and we just left Sendai for Kyoto yesterday. Good timing on our part, but everyone please be safe and I wish you all the best."
MetaParse,11/22/2016,"It's not safe, but if you build it on a disaster land then you will have issues at every disasters. That hasn't changed since the last tsunami.Repeating the anti-nuclear guys stuff over and over without thinking is annoying.You prefer mass coal-choking death ?"
JUSTIN_HERGINA,11/22/2016,"Nuclear rods have been found to burn through all containment systems, and only stop when they run out of energy. I'd really like to see a proper test that can simulate a 'china syndrome' scenario.I agree about the new systems, but the gen IV/molten salt reactors are still very much in their infancy.I won't be happy until they cease operation of the existing units. They are simply too unstable and produce way too much waste to be a viable, long term solution."
Weevil37,11/22/2016,"Am I misunderstanding the severity of a 3 meter tsunami, or are the Japanese so physically small in stature that this is a real hazard?"
benslowcalcalzonezon,11/22/2016,"First off 3 meters is over 9 feet so that's bad for anyone, and it's more than just a wave it's like the entire ocean rises up 9 feet and keeps going inland until something stops it"
Geekation,11/22/2016,Fuk me. :| pray those reactors hold or weren't further damaged by the quake.
HereComesPapaArima,11/22/2016,STAY SAFE MY JAPANESE BRETHREN
infinitezero8,11/22/2016,Stay safe.Hopefully One Piece won't get uninterrupted for next week.
Liquidies,11/22/2016,"Well, now the tsunami is only 3m and not 40 like it was last time."
