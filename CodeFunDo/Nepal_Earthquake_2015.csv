dia_36,26-Apr-15,My family is huddled up with more than a thousand people at one spot. They are running out of food. They just heard that some of our relatives have already run out of food. My cousin is 9 months pregnant and they ran out of food last night. I feel so helpless.

dia_36,26-Apr-15,Its this feeling of complete helplessness. I just want to send a bunch of food to my family but I cannot. :(

dia_36,28-Apr-15,"Update: There was heavy rain last night. The tents were leaking. So my brother and some other people took turns, all night to fill the buckets with rain water, to prevent everybody from getting soaked. The aftershocks are still frequent but is of lesser magnitude. Most people were able to go to their houses to collect food and other necessities.

My mom said they were getting used to the aftershocks and don't even get bothered by them anymore. So they were able to sleep last night.

They went out of the tent, for the first time, in 2 days and walked to nearby neighborhood. My mom was telling me that our neighborhood looked a lot better, compared to the rest of the area. But our house is severely damaged and I don't think they will be going back anytime soon.

My biggest concern, right now, is that since everything looks fine from the outside, the relief workers might not keep them as high priority. My second big concern is the spread of disease. They are living with 1000 people, in one big tent, in very close proximity. It will only take one person to get sick to spread a disease.

Tl;dr: Family slept through heavy rain in a tent. They are getting used to aftershocks. Neighborhood not as bad as other places, so fear of neglect by relief workers and spread of disease."
dia_36,4/26/2015,Yes. Mom told me they had spent the day disinfecting the camp and they have designated a place to keep garbage.

[deleted],4/28/2015,can we help in anyway? I donated but could we send food?
dia_36,4/28/2015,"Right now I don't know any way to get food into the country. I don't know how much of the money, being donated to the country, is getting to the people. My extended family, certainly, have not seen any relief. I have heard of individuals announcing, on twitter and facebook, that they are going to Nepal with food themselves. But I don't know if that is true or not. I donated to OXFAM because they said they were collecting funds to send food."

He is in a hard hit rural area of the country with thousands dead or missing. There is a full-fledged humanitarian crisis on the ground.

I was there all day yesterday and left a few hours ago. Flights are being canceled and rescheduled left and right because there's so much aid flying in that the airspace is congested and it's hard to fly out. So yes, try.

m2themichael,4/26/2015,"If anyone is in the area or knows of somebody in the area, we are looking for Spencer Dickinson, a 21 year old male from Petaluma, California. He was climbing Everest and heading to the first base-camp today. He hasn't contacted anybody and nobody can get a hold of him. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Here is his google person finder profile:

https://google.org/personfinder/2015-nepal-earthquake/view?family_name=&given_name=&id=2015-nepal-earthquake.personfinder.google.org%2Fperson.5081120392609792&query=dickinson&role=seek

(Somebody appears to have deleted it, I'll contact someone to put it back up in View Only mode).

Here is the new person finder profile: https://google.org/personfinder/2015-nepal-earthquake/view?family_name=&given_name=&id=2015-nepal-earthquake.personfinder.google.org%2Fperson.6193641979641856&query=Spencer+Dickinson&role=seek

UPDATE 4/26 9:54am pst: Still no word from Spencer, the search is still going. Thank you all for the help, the family is speechless right now after I shared with them all the help that you guys are doing to find this missing man. I'll keep you updated as I get around to more information.

UPDATE 10:19am pst: His family has now said that his location is somewhat unknown, he was seen last Saturday in Namche with plans to trek alone to the first Everest Basecamp.

UPDATE 11:04AM pst: (From the family member's facebook page)
""It sounds like Spencer was last seen leaving Base Camp two hours before the Avalanche hit, meaning there is a good chance that he was in a safe zone. Very hopeful""

UPDATE 3:49PM pst: Still no contact has been made regarding Spencer's status, however I have more information on his possible whereabouts and description thanks to what /user/anneco5 posted below:

Spencer Lee Dickenson 21 years olD Blond hair Blue eyes 5'5"" Possible tattoo on his back and under his forearm of which he received from a local monk.

He spent 2 days in Namche acclimatizing and then planned to continue on towards basecamp on Monday the 20th. He told his parents it would take him approximately 6-7 days to get to BC from Namche. Assuming he spent 1-2 nights in the villages of Deboche, Pheriche, and Lobuje it very well may have put him up around BC on Saturday the 25th

UPDATE 8:42PM pst: I just received an email from volunteer radio operators in Nepal. Communications are still disrupted in the area which could be why Spencer hasn't contacted home. They are radioing volunteers in the field to search for him and spread his name locally.

UPDATE 4/27 1:15AM pst: I'm going to bed. Thank you all for the wishes and help, I'll update again in the morning after I catch up on information as it is now day time in Nepal. No word on his status has been shared with me or the family. A team is about to reach base camp 1 and look for him. Keep Spencer and the rest of those missing in your thoughts and prayers <3

UPDATE 9:39AM pst: Just woke up with a flooded inbox with all of your thoughts and prayers. Thank you all, it's amazing how much support people I have never met can give, I'll be passing it on to the family. I've had one unconfirmed source saying he didn't make it, but I'm believing that is was a (terrible) joke. Nobody has contacted him yet, but communications are starting to open up in the city. I'll contact the IA and people at Base Camp 1 to see if they can find him.

UPDATE 1:36PM pst: A few climbers at base-camp 1 have Spencer's information and description. From what I am hearing they haven't seen him but are keeping their eyes out.

UPDATE 1:50PM pst: Some good news! A climber thinks he might have seen Spencer leaving basecamp heading down toward Lobuche around 9am the day of the avalanche. These include the villages of of Gorak Schep, Lobuje and Pheriche and others.

UPDATE 7:03PM pst: The U.S. Department of State has now joined in the efforts of finding Spencer. He will be featured on CBS News tonight. We are still waiting to hear from him or from others regarding his status. Thank you all for your efforts. It is sunrise now in Nepal so information should be coming in soon.

UPDATE 4/28 12:05AM pst: People in the area are telling me that the cell reception is terrible right now and his trek back to Namache would have taken him about 2-3 days to get back to. He should have service when he gets to Namache. Still no word.

UPDATE 9:35AM pst: I only received about 4 messages in the night, non of them updated Spencer's status. Information has really slowed down but I am going to make a big push today to find him. I'll be contacting a lot of people in Nepal and the US Embassy/Indian army. Please if you can help in any way, that would be greatly appreciated. It is too early to give up, but not to late to stop trying. Thank you for the support <3. We will find him.

UPDATE 11:05AM pst: Here is the story CBS did on Spencer. Also, I just received a message saying that communications are still down in the area and that only SAT phones are up right now. The search is still on.

UPDATE 9:02PM pst: Sorry for the lack of updates I have been in class all day. But I have some news for you all. SPENCER DICKINSON HAS BEEN FOUND ALIVE. From the sister's Facebook page:

MY DAD JUST RECEIVED A SATELLITE CALL FROM SPENCER. He is ALIVE!! and is currently being helicoptered to Katmandu! I have the biggest weight off my heart and am currently sobbing of joy in an Indian restaurant. I have the most incredible family in the entire world and have been overwhelmed with love and support. It is amazing what can happen when a village comes together! So grateful for each and everyone of you and your prayers. Spencer said that many around him did not survive, so please continue to pray for all those trapped on Everest or affected by any part of the earthquake in Nepal!!

I'd like to thank you all for your efforts in helping find Spencer, all the resources you guys pooled and all of the time you spent absolutely shocks me. Bringing together everyone from all over the world is truley an inspirational thing. I'll answer any questions if you guys have any, but this will probably be my last post. Thank you all <3 -M2theMichael

Last we heard he was going to try and climb down the mountain. That was about 28 hours ago. Nothing since then. His family and fiance are incredibly worried. I found a guy who was at his camp who was actively tweeting about 6 hours ago so I did a shout out to him seeing if he could find our guy.

I did send all the information about your guy to him though. Hes in a group of 3, so hopefully they are OK, and can use their eyes and scope out more missing people."

paul_swimmer,4/27/2015,"So my buddy up there made contact with us. He and his group are safe and sound. They hauled ass out of there as fast as they could. They just wanted to get off that mountain before things got worse.

He said that he will keep an eye out for your guy, but they didn't hang out. He said that there are over 60 people missing up there, but he will keep an eye open.

This is what he posted on facebook just now

""We are now well in Namche Bazaar. We were very close to Everest Base Camp when it happened. We saw the camp, and there is nothing left.""

srjnp,4/26/2015,"Nepal has been expecting this for about 10 years. Unfortunately, the buildings are already built and in such a densely populated area, there is not much we could do."
PointOfFingers,4/26/2015,"The predictions are chilling. Experts say than an 8.0 earthquake like the one that flattened Kathmandu in 1934 or hit Haiti in 2010 will kill up to 200,000 outright, injure 700,000 and render 1.5 million homeless. The airport will be crippled, half the bridges and schools will collapse, 95 percent of water mains will be broken, most hospitals will be heavily damaged, and road access to the valley will be cut off for weeks.

""It does not have to be an 8 [on the Richter scale] for massive devastation in Kathmandu,"" Reddick explained. ""A 6 will do. This will be worst than Haiti, I am sure of it. This will be a crisis that will shake the world's belief in its humanitarian system and its ability to respond."""
lindypenguin,4/26/2015,"Efforts to prepare for a big earthquake in Nepal have been ongoing for a long time both from international agencies and local NGOs such as the National Society for Earthquake Technology. However Nepal has been starting from such a low base and fighting bureaucratic ineptitude, corruption and just the shear scale of the task.

Efforts to plan, prepare, retrofit schools and hospitals and improve implementation of the building code have started to scale up in the last several years, but sadly this earthquake has come too soon to see these measures pay strong dividends."

guavainindia,4/26/2015,"Here is a list of organization doing relief work in Nepal and what they are doing specifically.

If you want to help victims of the Nepal Earthquake:

Please DO NOT SEND ITEMS, EVEN IF YOU THINK THEY WOULD BE USEFUL (unless you live locally and can transport them.) First of all, most of us don't know what they need right now. Also, the amount of resources and expense wasted sending objects over a long distance would go so much further in the form of cash. Finally, if you send money, they can employ local people and purchase locally, boosting the Nepali economy at this terrible time.

Think of it this way, you could buy a $30 dollar blanket, spend $75 to airmail it to Nepal, or you could donate $100 to a great charity that will buy a few dozen blankets from Nepali craftspeople, helping dozens of quake victims and boosting the Nepali economy!

If you have THINGS and not CASH, what should you do?

Organize a garage or yard sale and donate the proceeds

Sell your stuff on Etsy and donate the proceeds

Get together with some friends and make a fundraiser event by cooking some food, asking talented friends to perform, or whatever, and sell your stuff there! (Some friends and I did that a few years ago and just the few of us raised more than $600 dollars, not including our expenses!)

Sending Money not Items not only helps more people, but also prevents effort from being diverted from the rescue effort in order to organize often-useless boxes of stuff!"

[deleted],4/27/2015,"FYI - List of hikers found south of Langtang, some rescued by helicoper already, others waiting for the next one. They have food, seem to be uninjured.

Edit- More Info: My name is [redacted], and I was in Ghodatebela for the earthquake and the 48 hours following. Here is some information (to the best of my knowledge) about the effects of the earthquake in the Langtang Valley, most specifically Ghodatabela as well as the rest of Rasuwa:

The village of Langtang was the site of the largest single catastrophe, as the entirety of village was completely buried by an avalanche that came from thousands of feet above on the southern slopes of Langtang Lirung and Langtang II. Smaller settlements on the outskirts of Langtang, such as Chyamki, Thangsyap, and Mundu were also buried. It is impossible to determine exactly how many people died there, but the estimate is perhaps over 300 people in total. The handful of survivors, roughly twelve locals and two foreigners, walked down to Ghodatabela below after spending the night of the 25th in a cave - thus there is no one at Langtang itself. This avalanche is perhaps 2-3 kilometers wide, and is obstructing movement within the upper valley corridor. Currently two large groups are stranded above and below (due to several intensive and recurring landslides in the steep sections between Ghodatabela and Lama Hotel).

Above, at Kyangjin Gompa, there were reportedly (I was not able to go back up) fewer casualties (perhaps 5-10) yet many injured. Most of the injured have been evacuated via helicopter and there is an army medic team in place. Yet, currently, the problem is one of food shortage and illness. I have heard that the majority of the settlement, including the gompa, is remarkably intact. There is a smaller group of about 30-40 at the settlement of Sindum, about 4km below Kyangjin and closer to Langtang. This group has excavated several bodies from the major avalanche zone. They have also evacuated many of the injured, but are facing severe food shortages and illness (hopefully remedied by Nepal Army reinforcements and supplies on the evening of the 27th. Above Kyangjin Gompa, there were several smaller groups and climbing teams exploring the Upper Langtang valley, in a very high avalanche risk zone – I do not have good information on these groups, so please contact the respective embassies to determine who has been accounted for and evacuated via Kyangjim. As of the evening of April 27th, there was perhaps 120-140 people remaining above Langtang who need to be evacuated.

Below, at Ghodatabela (where I was located during the earthquake for roughly 55 hours following the event) several large landslides were triggered from all directions, the largest from perhaps 1,500 meters above just below the settlement, completely obstructing passage. The two guesthouses there were partially destroyed by large boulders, and the army checkpoint barracks collapsed during the earthquake. The night after the quake, there were two groups sleeping in separate fields by the river, keeping distance from ongoing landslides and rockfall that continued throughout the night. The first Nepal Army helicopter arrived at about 8:30am, which dropped a “medic team” and took the injured from the upper camp; the second helicopter took more from the upper camp, a chaotic mix of Nepalis and foreigners. The group from below then moved up to the Army checkpost to evacuate their injured, however, the Army helicopter never came back (we were told due to fuel shortage and/or weather – however the Army did not have a radio or phone, or any means of communicating). After these helicopters came, Nepali survivors arrived from above and below, carrying several injured – this was the group closest to the avalanche – yet, unfortunately, the Army had no way of communicating this to the rescue teams. This added a high level of uncertainty to hours of extreme grief, as Nepalis arriving from above and below realized the scale of their loss.

24 hours after the earthquake, the Army then moved the group to a single location across the river, which proved to be the safest location. In the evening, a private helicopter (with limited seats) arrived to evacuate a group of three Nepalis, yet they were replaced with the five most injured Nepali children (thankfully, yet forcefully). After this, a few of us worked with the Nepal Army to establish a formal triage list, which was 25 Nepalis and 2 foreigners (one Dutch and one Italian) for the next large Army helicopter, which arrived the next morning. We successfully loaded the sick onto the helicopter, with a few other family members accompanying them at roughly 10am on April 27th. The army helicopter did not come back again until 645pm, and in between a private helicopter (a single pilot who did seven trips that day singlehandedly, pro bono) took two small groups of 6 people from Ghodatabela. The loading of all these helicopters was a highly chaotic experience, owing to both fear and ineffective/confused management on behalf of the Army. Communication improved throughout, but fell apart during the most emotional moments. At Ghodatabela, there was originally roughly 65 foreigners and perhaps 110 Nepalis - as of the night of April 27th there were still about 40 foreigners and 60 Nepalis stranded there. My hope is that another helicopter has been coordinated for this morning (I will refrain from the time being from being overly critical of the helicopter evacuation system, there are pros and cons), yet I fear that many evacuation attempts were limited by the storm system that came this afternoon.

As of April 28th, as the aftershocks/tremors and rockfall have largely subsided, I was told that a few groups have successfully traveled from Ghodatabela through Sherpagaun via the high trail to Syaphru Besi. This is good news for the remaining, yet this is highly risky.

Elsewhere in Rasuwa, around Briddim and Lingling and in several places along the road from Dhunche to Betrawati, in places such as Grang and Ramche, the majority of houses collapsed. I am not sure of the casualties caused by structural collapse. The Dhunche road itself seemed passable from the air, as there are no new large slides (other than the existing monsoonal ones), but I was told by someone walking from Syaphru Besi to Kalikasthan that a member of their group had fallen to their death while travelling. Along the Trishuli River valley itself, there are other smaller landslides and reports of significant collapse at Mailung, Simle, and Archale. In Betrawati, Gerkhu, and Mhanegaun in bordering Nuwakot district several houses also collapsed, and there were casualties in all of these places.

The current data on total casualties following the earthquake here in Nepal is approaching 4,500. However, this is probably an underestimate considering that the estimate for the entire district of Rasuwa is 250, and there are at least 300 dead in the area around the village of Langtang alone. Across the board, it is still very difficult to determine exactly what has occurred in remote areas off the road system, as communication is down. Considered in terms of the percentage of total population, my sense is that Rasuwa has likely the third highest rate of fatality, behind Sindhupalchowk (at the epicenter of the major aftershock) and Dhading (closer to the center of the earthquake). Again, Langtang is probably one of the greatest single tragedies of this earthquake.

This is the latest news that I have as of 5pm on April 28th.

I hope this is helpful for the group"

[deleted],4/28/2015,"A villager died trying to rescue me

It was around 12 in the morning, I was supposed to feed water to goat. So, I headed towards barn. Suddenly, I heard a shake. Barn fell down before I could see left or right. I was trapped inside. Woods and stones fell upon me. At that moment, the earth shook so much that my buried body could feel it shaking tremendously. Luckily, my head and one hand was out in the open air. Besides that, every part of my body was covered. I started shouting, “Help me! Help me!” but no one came. After a while, a person came. I shouted,”Please help me get out, I have not died yet”. I didn’t recognize the person because my vision was blur. He told he can’t do it alone so he will get some men to help, but he never returned. I cried as loud as I can. Nobody heard. For a while, I thought I heard people crying and shouting. After a while, that too stopped. I thought the whole village has crashed and no one survived, I panicked even more. However, I didn’t stop shouting. A villager came after he heard me. He started pulling me, but a huge chunk of material fell upon him. I dug my hand and tried to rescue him. I found his finger but I could not pull. After sometime, the finger became cold. He died trying to save me. I have 2 children and a wife. Thinking that they too had died, I had no hope to live. But, I could not die. After the earthquake, people gathered in the field and searched their loved ones. My wife started searching me too. Around 4 pm, my wife came towards the barn shouting and searching for me. Hearing her voice, I started crying continuously. She heard, she came and she asked for others help. 7-8 people came to rescue me. They got me out and I survived. We spent the night in the open field. Now, I finally felt that I would live. But I don’t think I can return home again.

kevmullet,4/27/2015,"Message from a friend on Everest right now.

Sounds scary as!

""After 48 hours of being wired we are at BC. The past few days have been scary as hell. We were living on the edge with new tremors making C1 unstable and causing avalanches. It has been nerve wracking. The noises have been intense and trying to predicate directions of these knock on avalanches has left us all frayed. Imagine that I now say that this was a better place to be than BC. The ice fall is ruined and deemed totally impassable – I believe 3 ice fall doctors have been killed and the rest have left BC. Needless to say the season is over. Coming back to BC wasn’t a moment of joy. There are bodies still lying covered in snow waiting to be airlifted out and there is debris all over a vast expanse. The visuals resemble how I would imagine a nuclear bomb site to be. Relieved for a few outcomes – Henry was bloody lucky scrambling behind a stupa and Bhola was carried 50m but again is okay – selfishly knowing some of my crew are okay helps. My tent along with tims, Ingos, Jo’s are gone there is nothing left only tatters caught on rocks. This is a small price to pay and I am fully aware of that. I have found a glove 200m away and my down suit was over 150 m totally shredded. We are all digging looking for things with the knowledge that there are still people unaccounted for. It’s a hard task to get stuck into. I hear that Raj is moving up to Pheriche now to help with med clinic. Then his plan is to push up to BC in a few days’ time. Will be good to see another familiar face."""
