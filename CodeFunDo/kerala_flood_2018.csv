UlanBatori,16 Aug 2018 23:22,"Came by e-pata: KHNA - Kerala Flood Relief AppealDear XXXXXX,Hari Om.As you all are aware, our homeland Kerala is undergoing one of the worst natural calamities in the history of the state due to relentless monsoon rains and flooding. As a result, many of our people are having being displaced from their homes, waiting to be rescued and many have even lost their lives. Many organizations are canceling their Onam programs and are collecting funds/clothes /food etc for our people in Kerala.This is the time we come together as one and to do what we can possible to help our people.KHNA is working with Sewa USA where you can donate online.Click the button to donate with Sewa USA campaignKeeping your families and loved ones in our prayers for their safety.Hari OmDr. Rekha MenonPresident, KHNAThe sheer magnitude of the disaster may be gauged from the fact that the KHNA took a break from suing each other and biting each other's asses to actually post a useful link. Seriously, it is a millennial event unless worse happens next year as it probably will. 1924 was a full-fledged cyclone: roofs blew off. But here it is just rain and official nincompoopiness in timing the dam openings to coincide with max damage potential. It's not ""low-lying areas"" flooded any more: it is the entire ground floor of the majority of several districts. Rs. 10 lakh per cent property value areas. And how can you tell that it's the dam release? ""Strong wesward flow"". Water level rose like 3 or 4 feet around 2AM!!!!"

These ppl (the ophishialdom and Baboon-Mantricracy) seem to have learned *****NOT A THING*** from the Chennai SNAFU of 2015. They sat on their thumbs for days and didn't think about the forecasts, and then opened all the dams to synchronize the peak flooding at 2AM for maximum effect. 115 dead, toll rising with the water levels. I would not be surprised if the top 10 or so are absconding when the levels do down enough for the lynch mobs to arrive at their mansions. Now if the Mullapperiyar dam gives way (I would say 80 percent probability - the rickety thing is shaky in the weakest of monsoons) that may well become 115,000."

Now THERE's one way to spell Relief...I have a seriously bad feeling about Mullapperiyar dam. They've let that nonsense go on for waaaay too long. In every normal monsoon that thing has been on the verge of collapse, and now we have a 100-year cataclysm. I just don't see how it is going to survive, even the earthen base of the dam is in danger of dissolving. Wonder what I'll see in the news when I get up tomorrow or Saturdin. When the govt publishes Ophishial Letters saying IT IS FALSE TO SAY THAT THERE ARE CRACKS DEVELOPING IN THE DAM, it is time to run for high ground. Entire districts, let alone cities, are under water. I bet the main train route has tunnels that are underwater, and bridges are near collapse/washaway. National highway is mostly underwater except the raised parts. In some places people taking refuge on the ""first floor"" meaning the one about the ground floor, are in danger of being swept away. Hospitals are being evacuated. Good thing some of the schools have upper floors and are built of concrete."

NH66 from Kalamassery all the way to Thrissur is waterlogged except the flyovers. The only remaining northward connectivity from Kochi is via the coastal road from Vypin to Munambam. The entire Chalakudy basin is also under metres of water. The Manali/Kurumali basin to the north is also totally flooded, with the water flowing over the NH.Muvattupuzha basin is flooded at the Muvattupuzha area. The downstream areas of this system seems to be doing slightly better than the others as I gather from the severity reports.Pamba basin is practically gone. This is because this is a narrow one with heavy population on the banks.Sabarimala Temple is isolated, with the chief priest and assistants there. No way for devotees or anything else to reach there.

Sachin,17 Aug 2018 11:49,"Updates I received this morning from Thrissur district side;1. The main highway connecting Coimbatore to Ernakulam had been blocked by heavy land slide in the ghat section of Kuthiran. Yesterday the queue of vehicles extended nearly 15kms on both sides. Some trucks, including a rescue truck from TN's Fire Brigade got trapped in the land slide. Now they have cleared one line of the highway and vehicles are slowly being released. How ever the advice is avoid travel if you can.2. There was also severe water logging in the western side of Thrissur town, which cut off the road access from Kozhikode side through Edappal & Valanchery. The water has subsided a bit, and now the route is open for some minimum amount of road traffic.3. There was also heavy rise of water in the Bharathapuzha river which forced the police to close the road bridge at Cheruthuruthi, cutting off access to the district from the near by Palakkad district.

The number of people who have stuck on the 1st floor of the buildings is really high. Unfortunately there was no one to tell these people that moving up one level up their buildings is a problem. They should have evacuated when the ways to get out were still open. But what has happened as happened, so the KL govt. is also trying to rush in boats from the coastal areas (the fishermen volunteering) to be used in such areas.

Now THERE's one way to spell Relief...This news seems to be trickling down to more people. When Okhi hurricane hit KL's coastal belt, the central government had given relief funds worth 100 crore. The story is that 70% of them went for non-Okhi relief activities. The state government also had jacked up the money value of losses, which the central govt. had promptly caught.Yes, liquor tax rates have gone up from 23% to 27%. This was officially confirmed by the state CM. Pretty much the whole state is flooded and the state government hopes that the boozers of KL would ""hear the call of duty"" and promptly queue up in front of the liquor outlets.This also gives me an indication on the financial mess the state is in. Relief funds raised by raising liquor prices!! I have tried my two paisa worth by helping in local charity organisations & youth clubs.

From what I got from the media; only the chief priest and few staff is there at the temple.

Sachin,17 Aug 2018 12:53,"nvishal wrote:1) Anyone knows the cause? More rain than usual this year?Yes the rain fall (especially in the catchment areas of the dams) have been very high. This led to dams getting opened, which then also increased water flow in the rivers. It has been nearly 20+ years since dams have opened up and released so much water. During these 20+ years lots of homes,flats etc. also got built very near to the rivers, assuming that the rivers would never rise up to the current levels. In the hill districts of Kerala there were also big time encroachments and deforestation. In such areas there were also land slides, which led to many deaths. Buildings were constructed in unsafe areas and land slides just demolished the buildings. In one case a tourist resort was built on such encroached land, clearly flouting the ""stop memos"" from the government. This year around the resort was cut off and tourists had to be rescued by NDRF/Army. From what I understand casualties are more due to land slides etc; more than due to flooding.2) I understand that areas have been water logged. Is it receding or adding?In certain districts rains have stopped and water is receding. Thrissur & Malappuram districts are seeing more of sun today. But from Dileep et.al looks like some Southern districts are again facing problems. The dams up stream may have to release more water as there has been heavy rainfall in the catchment areas.3) Has any agency released satellite pics of the affected areas? Affected population size?

SC wants water level at Mullaperiyar dam reduced by 3 ft..But if the water is released from Mullaiperiyar it should land up in the reservoir of the huge dam at Idukki. And the water would have to be released from there as well. Hope KL Govt. manages this with adequate precautions.

If I were running home/bijnej insurance I would have to raise premiums drastically, esp for anyone in 100-year flood plain - or 100-year landslide slope - which is now all of Kerala. In Yoo Ess it is hard to get insurance at all if one is in 100-year flood plain. So the solution is to make sure that 100-year flood plain contour descends by about 2 meters by increasing drainage/absorption/exchange capacity. But even that will not prevent the stupidity that got 35 (or 80?) dams to open shutters full and coordinated to cause max rate of rise in the middle of the night. Where was the flood warning? Why were people not warned to move stuff up 5 feet or get out, before the dam gates were opened? For this only a video of beheadings in the town square or firing squad, will bring about reform (safe to suggest: not gonna happen, the goons ""responsible"" are also the ""government"". The CM needs to go, the Heads of the agencies who should have started matching dam outflow to inflow and providing capacity for at least 2 or 3 days continuous rain - or at least send out Tweets warning that this was not being implemented due to foot-dragging, should go. In this sense the disaster was ***VERY*** human-made. If the damned dams were not there, as Nature set it up, the floods would have been far less (and the drought to follow far worse, of course, and kept the population down as well..)

UlanBatori,18 Aug 2018 3:12,"Slightly OT but not if u r interested in solving problems:Many issues in Malloostan are similar to the mess in California - and solutions may be similar. Of course in Here’s a suggestion for decision-makers on the California Water Commission who are now finalizing the distribution of $7.5 billion in bond money for storage projects: Look underground.The state should give up — at last — on dated, expensive, environmentally destructive dams and instead put funds toward infrastructure and programs that would help us store more water in aquifers, where there’s plenty of room.In fact, the vacant storage space in California’s aquifers is about three times as large as the volume of all of the state’s surface reservoirs, according to Ellen Hanak, water specialist at the Public Policy Institute of California.Aquifer storage has been used in California for decades, but it has gotten increased attention since the state passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014. That law requires water districts to begin regulating groundwater use. It was inspired, in part, by the understanding that California’s other water storage methods — dams and Sierra snowpack— have declined. No large, river-obstructing dams have been built in California since the 1970s (partly because all the best sites are already taken), and the snowpack is dwindling as a result of climate change.The simplest way to recharge aquifers is to flood the ground over them.Aquifers offer more resilience than either alternative. They are often located precisely beneath the communities that consume their water, so they reduce pumping costs and promote local control. Recharging them is relatively cheap. And unlike reservoirs, aquifers aren’t subject to evaporation. By contrast, the nation’s two biggest reservoirs, Lakes Mead and Powell, annually lose about 10% of all the water flowing through the Colorado River basin, according to Ben Livneh, a hydrologist at University of Colorado at Boulder.Aquifer storage holds particular promise for the southern San Joaquin Valley, where agricultural groundwater use is unsustainably high. Since the mid-1980s, valley farmers have annually pumped an average of 1.8 million more acre-feet of groundwater than is replaced by natural and intended replenishment. So much pumping has occurred, in fact, that in some places, aquifers have compacted and the land above them has subsided by as much as 28 feet. The threat of compaction lends urgency to recharging the aquifers: Leave large portions of them empty for extended periods and many more will contract, losing their storage capacity forever."

And, from there, how many days it takes to normalcy, rate of flow, etc.Now, regarding the rate of flow you mentioned, our ""man made infrastructure"" did play its role - example dams held up catchments, and once reached threshold, they got to release it. so, q: who was holding it up? man/nature?---ok, later for some other day., when you owe me a drink at your dera-mahab-ali place."

But from what I can understand KL is expecting more military help and expecting central government funds. On the military help part, Def. Min has already promised more helicopters, boats and men; which is expected to start operations today. And to be frank there seems to be a demand for a ""blank cheque"" to be given from the central government. Looks like it is all boiling down to money. ""Give us more money, dont hold us accountable or else both Congress & CPI(M) combined would start bad mouthing BJP (Central Govt.)"" - seems to be what the political class and their agents in Main Stream Media seems to be saying.

Dileep,18 Aug 2018 9:06,"This notion that the flood happened due to dam opening is WRONG!! Till 16th afternoon, that was the case, but the flood generally stayed in the expected path.What happened after 16th afternoon is that the dams were discharging water at the same rate as being receiving. They were at max capacity, so could not store more. So, the point is, the big flood that pushed water upto 7 km beyond the river happened after the flow stabilized at out=in.I am making a map of flooded areas from the Periyar basin, and you would know. Will do in a few hours.Let me also mention that the earth looks nice and tiny on google. Likewise, KL looks a tiny spec of land sitting stateside. I experienced this 12000km altitude vision effect during the Tsunami event myself. So, with all due respect to the respected Yak Herder, all those suggestions are almost as practicable as the space station building technology of some evil relative of his.And about warnings.. Yes, absolutely there were warnings, but the expectation was that the water from the dam will pass in half a day. This continuous pouring of 3 to 4 thousand cubic metres water per second due to rain was never anticipated. Did people heed to warning? Most didn't, and that is the problem right now.TN did its nasty part in to other dams. They opened Sholayar dam without much warning and flooded Peringalkuthu, resulting in flooding at Chalakkudy basin. They opened Neerar dam without warning to Idamalayar, adding to the Periyar flood. Both dams stayed above MWL till yesterday evening.There was warning at Pamba basin also. We had the Pamba roadhead (start of Sabarimala trek) submerged on 13th, so it was very well anticipated to flood downstream. there were warnings in the morning of 16th, but people stayed put, possibly because they are quite used to minor flooding. By evening, the river started overflowing.There again, the relentless push of rain water was the real problem."
Dileep,18 Aug 2018 9:31,"Sachin, I don't agree with the notion of ""outsourcing"" or ""sense of entitlement"" etc. What we need are the equipment, expertise and execution f the Army.Right now, all the police, fireforce, govt staff and public are actively conducting the rescue. Fisherfolk are helping out with their boats. All working vehicles are being used. What we desperately need is more helicopters for airlift, command and control expertise for better co-ordination and communication infra. Simply having someone with a wireless set in touch with command centre present in the fishing boat would work as a force multiplier.What we lack now are:1. Efficient command and co-ordination. The govt's system of co-ordination will not work. They work in the ""write in file"" type system. Police is no better. They know only how to ""protect"" the netas and ""lathi charge"" the demonstrators.2. Efficient leadership: The current ministers are a bunch of ""people's leaders"" whose sole qualification is how well they articulate the politburo's ""report"" at the lower ""fractions"".

hnair,18 Aug 2018 9:59,"A few things from my side, that may go contrarian to BRF's reigning wisdom:- I have no love lost for the malabar warlord, but despite having a serious health issue, which needs urgent treatment, the current CM did a decent job in co-ordinating and not losing the nerve in some harrowing occasions. All officers and even the opposition leader (in the beginning) grudgingly admit that,- Despite rumors saying no such request was made, a formal request has already gone from CMO for treating this as a National disaster. Hoping that during Shree Modi's ongoing visit, he will announce it at Kochi.- Dam opening went as per textbook. It was based on rigorous SOPs. The weather gods decided to teach a lesson that however careful the SOPs are, it is a different matter when they get pissed- I had in the past fully supported TN's stance that it needs to be given Mullaperiyar water and took the stance that the dam is safe (based on inputs from my alumni sources, who routinely inspects the dam). Mullaperiyar was build by the Maharaja and they have a policy of death sentence for corruption and hence the dam, despite being made of old tech, is considered reasonably safe. The real problem dam, that is of concern to all, but only whispered around: Idamalayar Dam. Why? because the current coalition partner of LDF, Balakrishna Pillai was convicted for extreme corruption, when building that dam as former Power Minister in Karunakaran cabinet! - The people of TN is different from CM of TN and are opening their hearts out in helping Kerala. But as Dileep rightly pointed out, the current TN CM (not the people, if anyone feels offended) has proven he is a first class douche, in not taking the repeated phone calls by Kerala CM on that fatefull day, asking for co-ordination in opening shutters. The chaiwallah who runs tea-shop outside CMO says when CM of Kerala called up the TN CM for third time since morning, he was told ""he is taking his regular lunch nap"". From 1:00 till 4:00 or something. Why did TN CM finaly ""wake up"" at 4:00? Because CM of K rang up Shree Modi and Shree Rajnath at around 4:45 or so and told them about Thiru Sleeping Beauty-avarkal of Chennai..... Apparently Shree Modi read the riot act to the Sleeping Beauty-avarkal! The CM later went to Governor and lodged a formal protest at the callousness. Even the supreme court chipped in and asked to reducing the water height, not that it was what was needed- UB-sir, Sachin et al Please read this carefully: humble request to tone down some of the cliche rhetoric at this point! The CMDRF is audited and closely monitored by all parties in Kerala and I can vouch for that. If it goes to only to CPI-M, there will be hell to pay, politically and otherwise. I was at the white building till 2:00 PM yesterday, trying to get the credit gateways for foreign cards opened. Approvals from RBI were sought and given in record time. But thanks to rhetoric like your's lots of people took the Amazon route, trying to byepass govt. There were only three NGOs listed by Amazon, who can list what supplies they want and donors can donate them. And our of three, guess who was lurking there prominently? World Vision India..... So be careful about who gets benefited if an elected govt in India, whatever their foibles, is disparaged. I have requested (via a friend) for Amazon to shut that shyte down, yesterday itself and add Indian NGOs of repute. PM's relief fund is another option, which too reaches CMDRF, but takes a bit of time to reach the right department. So it is not cool to hear these online posts about CMDRF etc, without knowing what traps are set for donors by EJ types! Us on the ground have to work with all sides and we will have to work harder to make sure for equitable distribution!!! - Everyone is chipping in as they can. I havnt seen SHQ or kids for two days during daytime, since they are all scrounging the town for supplies from shops and bundling them into kits for airdrop by IAF etc. - CMO is run by an ex-IA officer from Air-artillery and his composure during the crisis was exemplery. A war-room with Revenue-secy taking command is on and it has NDRF, IA, IAF and Naval officers present 24x7- Dileep, the issue with helicopters is range - they could not provide fuel depots for quick drops. Example, in Pathanamthitta ops, they had to keep coming back to Trivandrum airport for topping up, losing valuable on-site time. This is something of a lesson learned. Each district of India should have a helicopter mustering area for such calamities, where fuel can be dumped during contingencies- Trivandrum had a luckier break as a city, since the major flooding was away from airport and both civvy/military planes are buzzing. And for that I think Lord Padmanabha for the umpteenth time- The hardwork is going to start, once rescue mode is over: re-building almost 12,000 kms of roads, 200 odd bridges etc- Swamiye Saranamayappa!!"

It is now taking a ""Give me what ever I want.. or else"" mode. I am sure there is much more collaboration between all the agencies concerned, KL Govt, GoI and Forces - behind closed doors. But now I see at the common man level it is back to ""Modi & Naarthies v/s us"" kind of stories. Which also means that many people who post in these groups are also now in safer areas and are in no immediate danger. There has been some discussions on ""completely handing the state over to the Armed Forces"", but to be frank I don't even know whether such provision exists. My understanding is that a elected civilian government cannot just hand over every thing to the Army. My understanding is that Armed Forces have deployed/still deploying more equipment and more technical expert units (like MEG etc.) and doing their best. But yesterday it was a local politician crying to the TV channel - ""give me n number of helicopters this night or else 50,000 people would die"". There has been difficulties for helicopters to operate due to weather and the geographical conditions. And the helicopters are primarily focusing on people who need real immediate help.Simply having someone with a wireless set in touch with command centre present in the fishing boat would work as a force multiplier. My understanding is that this is being put to action. Police have already opened up their stores and are issuing wireless sets, but if the users don't have the proper ""radio discipline"" it may not be effective. I know for sure that Amateur Radio Operators are chipping in with what ever they could do. Just got off an emergency net 10 mins back. Command centres are opened up at places like Ernakulam Collectorate. Wayanad alone has four VHF base stations (and many mobiles) operated by HAMs. And from what I understand most of the traffic they handle are on ""man missing"" cases (mainly because mobile phones have run out of power). I agree with all the three points you listed. Looks like the state administration, and ""people's leaders"" are all losing grip on the situation. Which may be the reason for all of them joining hands and pushing the buck to some one else. But honestly, I don't know even if the Armed Forces can completely reign in the situation at this moment. Do we have troops who can be brought into Kerala state in quick time? How many of more helicopters boats etc can be pulled out from their regular operational duties to move to Kerala? Again even if all this happens how much of work can they achieve quickly because they do NOT have a firm grip on the roads, rivers and social demography etc. It is the political games now being played which is a bit worrisome."

UlanBatori,18 Aug 2018 17:39,"hnairji, long-distance mondin morning quarterbacking onlee. Apologies. Great work. But if ppl send money to Amazon/Whirled Vision it is certainly not because I dissed the Twin Elephants. People that clueless cannot be helped. Having said that (and hope you succeeded in shutting the Whirled vijion musharraf) the CM**** does have a reputation to live down. The gyan on what happened there is neither fron neuj outlet nor politicians, but from ppl who sat like you, except far more frequently, next to the High Netas for decades. Utterly depressing, as you will probably find out in due course when the excitement settles down. Meanwhile May The Force Be With You!!Practically speaking, if someone asks: ""where should I send money NOW to help?"" the answer is **NOT** the guvrmand's channels. Because they can get all that they can get from the Central guvrmand or state guvrmand credit, if not the vast reserves in the treasury. todin's neuj: The Kerala government had sought Rs 8,316 crore as a special package from the Central Government for dealing with the situation. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh who visited the flood-hit state on Sunday announced an immediate relief package of Rs 100 crore.Are they going to treat your paise with any more respect/efficiency than they treat THAT? The TA musharraf in disaster relief AFAIK is distribution when done top-down. The guvrmand can only reach so many sources, because ultimately the guvrmand is a very few individual aphsars using their ophishial cell-phones etc to call up ppl and beg them to sell/deliver stuff. And here the State Govt. of Kerala has an absolutely biss-boor record of NOT PAYING BILLS on time. State aphsar is not empowered to give credit card to aam abdul and ask him to go buy stuff On Behalf Of The TwinElephants. OTOH, a private relief agency can muster as many volunteers as the State can muster aphsars, and they operate on goodwill built up. Also, their ability to operate IS contingent on grassroots delivery performance. So they are more effective. So the solution is **NOT** to ask people to pour their paise into the guvrmand's kitty, but to give it to local grassroots agencies that have the ability to get resources down to the individual relief worker. For instance, if Relief Worker Ayesha needs cash to fill her scooter's gas tank so that she can continue running errands, will the govt give her the funds or credit? Or get her 6th coujin in Belgaum to load up a truck with baby food and building supplies and send it to Aluva, will the govt move fast enough? Also, really good relief agencies focus on rebuilding with improvement, not just relief. Govt takes way too long to do this. In the long term, the CM's Relief Fund does not need money because they ARE going to get Central money in large amounts.

For the past two days after watching people donating essential materials to flood relief, they came to me saying they wanted to donate all their money to the children who lost their books and bags in the flood.

Dileepji: thx for clarification, but with all respect, if the water level rose from below street level to 4 feet above inside 1 or 2 hours it was certainly not rain but dam release. Hard fact: these are ppl who have lived there all their lives. The Big Cheese who said ""ain't leaving, water won't come up any further"", ""until the water touched his feet"" is 94+ and a farmer all his life: his understanding of rain is a big better than the government's. Also, yes, connecting westward slopes to eastward slopes via tunnels/pipelines is a major undertaking, but maybe a lot small than building a dam at Idukki, let along Yellow River. Has been done when ppl wanted it desperately enough. Is it worse than watching this same playout next year, or say 5 years of reconstruction later? **And building those things in Space is equally feasible, BTW, and shown carefully to be so. Maybe not to Malloostan PeeDubyaDee based on their awesome record of road-building and maintenance (look at the Kuthiran mess), but for nominally competent and hard-working and forward-thinking ppl.*** Even at Kuthiran, they have actually built the entrances to a 4-lane tunnel that is quite long, at both ends, though it must be now below water at both ends. Maybe next year we can read of the low drama as British Navy SEALS experienced from the Thailand caves reach the cars stranded in the high pockets inside the Kuthiran tunnel. Why not? Why would you expect the tunnel to ***NOT** get flooded next year unless the monsoon fails? Unable to find local temple/church/mosque sites collecting /organizing relief: I am sure they are out in the field working, no time and maybe no power to make websites. If you find any links pls post."

Mr. Carter said he had given this undertaking to then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.Mr. Carter, who will be in Mumbai to witness construction of small homes by Habitat for Humanity, said the group had approached him in the U.S. to intercede with the Government of India on its behalf. Though a former President, he had taken up the matter with Mr. Gandhi who asked him to sign an oath that there would be no proselytization activities.If took Rajiv Gandhi's govt to extract this oath, you can imagine how much of a threat these guys would have posed.

Dileep,18 Aug 2018 18:35,"UB Sir, I never said neither is impossible. I would never say that against something you said. But I have some little issues on the ""take water east"" idea.1. You still need a dam to hold water. It need not hold a lot of water, but dam nevertheless.2. Let us assume that we build a 100ft tall dam at the same location as Idukki. Forget the Cheruthoni basin for now. It would have caught around 1000 Cumex (two third of the total inflow of todays Idukki) of rain in the past week..3. You need to blast a tunnel of 34km through the hard rock to Cumbum. I never had to study or learn hydraulics, but looking at the sluice gates of Cheruthoni that discharged the 1500Cumecs, you would probably need a 50 ft dia tunnel to deliver the water. The current power generating drain is 7m diameter onlee.4. Then you need to cut an open channel of hundreds of meter wide to carry the water to the river Vaiga.In all, I would say the effort is much more than building the current Idukki dam system.Now, the KILLER QUESTION: What about flooding at Vaiga with all the water? The mighty periyar is flooded with just 500Cumex!!Now back to the current issue.The water raise was due to dam release, but it sustained for three whole days because of continued inflow. If the dam was not there, the raise would have been slower by a few hours, but the peak would have been the same, hence spread would have been the same."

UlanBatori,18 Aug 2018 19:02,"The problem I see is that Dam Opening Protocol is based purely on dam level, not weather prediction and taking a gamble on losing a few days' rain. Also the fear that exceeding the top level will threaten dam safety. Plus too much delay. That synchronizes dam openings with peak rain flooding **rate** periods. The function of a dam should be to **CHECK** the river flow so that during flood times the dam takes more water than usual. This requires that water be released well ahead of time to create new capacity. And every time there is a letup in rains, this discipline must be followed, to keep preparing. This is tough: what if you release 10 feet of water with a month left in the Official Monsoon - and no more rains come? So good weather prediction models are needed, unless you proactively sink rain into the ground (acquifer flooding) and to places which can store into the dry season so that demand at the height of dry season is reduced. With a little better planning a 5-foot-peak flood could be kept down to a 6-inch or 1-foot flood which won't bother most ppl so that everyone can go back to **Yawn, it's only some poor ppl in low-lying areas and why do these stupid ppl go build homes there, hain?""

It is readily rejected by the CMO like this. ""Adey Kuppuchamee, antha Kerala ""Dam Sef Onlee"" letter kaappi anuppi vidu"". They apparently have a bunch of letters cyclostyled which says ""Dam sef onlee. Level 142 Onlee"", which would be prompted by Peon Kuppuchamy avargal.TN's interest i to store as much of water in the reservoir and use it for the intended (irrigation) and unintended (power generation) throughout the year. If they take all the water as it comes, there are multiple problems:1. No place to store. They can not have a reservoir large enough without taking up a lot of very valuable agricultural land. Remember that the terrain is essentially flat, so a lot of area will be needed to store the water. If they store the water in the MP dam, it is pretty deep and less area onlee.2. Can't handle the flow. It is actually too much water. Of course, you can ask for twenty channels, practically multiplying the expense by 15, and taking up much more arable land.3. Can't admit even an iota that the dam could be remotely unsafe. They very well know that give an inch there, it is a gone case.4. Don't give a hoot. It is lives of their rightful colony, so who cares?They already have two channels to take water east. One is a canal (original one). The other is the tunnel and penstock they use to generate power (which is not part of the agreement, BTW). They can take out significant amounts of water, but not the 1000+Cumecs"

UlanBatori,19 Aug 2018 0:29,"No place to store. They can not have a reservoir large enough without taking up a lot of very valuable agricultural land. The gist of the Caliphoriastan article I posted b4 is that dams are now passe. ""New"" storage mode is Acquifer, underground, and way to store is simply flood field above and keep it flooded. Replenish ground water table until whole place is swelled up and ready to float. Saw a CalTech dynamic simulation that shows CA ""breathing"" like the tummy of a sleeping and well-fed cat as water storage changed from drought to flood and back. Most of KL and TN had ""teppakulam"" or ""chira/kulam"" respectively which acted as very effective Water Retention/Detention ponds, and kept water table replenished. Need to enforce those again all over the states, looking at contour maps and using all low-lying areas but also create them in every neighborhood to arrest erosion due to high-speed flow. By this logic the ground under MP and other reservoirs must be suitably waterlogged, but apparently that does not spread widely. So surface/near-surface high-flow tubes/canals are needed to do the first-level distribution over many miles. It's really not that much raakit science: canal network already exists. The idea of using the canals for year-round transmission to acquifer storage, is not done. Got to check the CA acquifer article if they do anything more sophisticated. Basically, every home can easily have year-round water storage underground if they have manual or electric pumps. No sunlit land area lost. Chennai had chronic and worsening water scarcity until recently. Now apparently not an issue. Reason? The late ""Thaa"" introduced ""voluntary"" rainwater harvesting for every bldg, residential or commercial. Voluntary, but she wondered aloud why guvrmand should voluntarily give scarce electric power to ppl who did not have voluntary rh. since they had to have rolling blackouts due to power shortage and would like some volunteers to not get power at all.

(Rough translation: Last Resort: ""You! Sit Down!"".) Aquifiers do work. But you do know that most of Kerala have ground water within 10 metres of the surface year round. Of course there are areas where wells go dry, but those wells are shallower than that, and ended because they hit solid rock. Also, most of the areas I know have wells filling upto the brim during monsoon. Now, going across the fence to TN. I believe we could bring a significant area in the southwest TN to good ground water levels if we can get the excess water across by whatever ""Bhageeratha's Effort"" needed. I see a few problems with that.1. Civil Construction effort will be that of ""Bhageertha""2. The construction will cause Destruction of the ""very sensitive ecosystem of the western ghats"". You could probably build a rope way between Munnar and Theni with the twisted panties that result.3. Millions of acres of land will have to be physically converted to take the water. The soil in TN do not readily absorb water as of now, so you will have to literally flood the area for the water to get down. It will take decades of cycling for the soil microstructure to mimic that of KL,which sucks water like a sponge.4. During these decades, the agricultural system of the TN will suffer a transcient loss. You lose half the year's growing season. Right now, they use the land the entire year, thanks to the Mullaperiyar water.To summarize, it will need a ""Bhageeratha's Effort"" (where is the money, and what is the RoI?) cause hardship for the farmers there for decades before the place turns similar to GoC. What it will do for KL is totally unknown.Now: How will we get electricity? Humble question onlee. Dams are passe it seems. Expecting another ""ഇരിയെടാ അവിടെ!"""
hnair,19 Aug 2018 10:01,"Yesterday morning, Trivandrum Collector Vasuki sent out a whatsapp note, asking for 50 volunteers for bundling relief packets at Trivandrum Air Force station's Technical gate. Went there with three other friends, since due to bridge failures, the road clearance to neighboring Kollam and Pathanamthitta was not yet given for civilian convoys and heli-drop was the only way. We worked for a few hours, manually unloading a C17, under guidance of Airforce and NDRF personnel. For first time in my life, I did headload of full size sacks of grain, unloaded the craft onto waiting civilian trucks (given free of cost by owners and driven for free by drivers), which took the supplies to the processing point at the periphery of the apron. There we along with other volunteers who were already busy, unloaded the small civilian trucks and then packed these into plastic sacking. 10 kg of ready to eat supplies like bread, biscuits, water, juice etc as well as sanitary napkins, basic medicines were loaded. We were told to make sure there are airpockets so it can float after the drop but the knots can be untied by bare hands.Just before we were being bused over to the waiting C17, a junior afsar asked the AF driver if there is water in the bus and food for us. Some youngster chirped saying ""we are fine"". He just ignored that and made sure a crate of water and biscuits were put in. Later I told the youngster about General Omar Bradley's dictum ""amateurs talk strategy, professional talk logistics"", pointing out that if one of us fell dehydrated inside the C17, it will add on to the situation. But the care shown by the IAF afsars were amazing in general.A few observations of the volunteer crowd- All of the volunteers, except us three were just kids, late teens or early 20s.- Lot of them looked visibly affluent, wearing good clothing/shoes- Some of them looked frail and some were over weight, needed help carrying loads, which was readily given- A good percent were girls, who did the packing etc- None took out their phones for selfies during the entire process or slacked off, except for a drinkFinally, when we lined up (tired and dusty) after the trucks got filled to brim and the C17 was empty, the senior afsar smiled and said, ""allright, you can take a few"" and out comes the phones But then the senior afsar pointed out that the giant engines hanging limply off those wide wings are going to start turning in a minute..... The phones went back in after loosing off a few selfies and bus got instantly filled upSo next time, when someone writes about ""Yoootthh nowadays! Selfies onleee! They amount to nothing, unlike my days"", showing classic ""Old men in park benches"" syndrome, I got a contrarian view -the rich kids of this gen are better than your generation. They dont sit in front of TV and yell at NBJP, they go out and do shyteDue to the atmosphere, the jingo in me barely registered two peacock-Dhruvs, three An 32s, one IL78 (talked to the driver after seeing his aerial refueling patch), one C130J and of course the C17, which roared away immediately for more supplies from NDRF stashes around the country. The IL78 came with NDRF personnel, with their hi-visibility uniforms. Helicopters were buzzing back and forth with SAR people etc. I saw an officer with UAV patch. Looks like Searchers were deployedOk, logging off"
Dileep,19 Aug 2018 10:18,"What do I propose (FWIW)?I do not believe any of these ""first world solutions"" will work, because we are still Kerala, with the Neta-Babu nexus. My firm take is that events like this can not be prevented, but we can prepare to have a much better and efficient response.People did not have the correct impression of the area under threat. On day 1, I was surprised to hear certain area near NAD started flooding. Going to Google Earth, I could actually trace the path using the altitude indication. Eye Opener!! After that, I could follow and to some extent predict the threats. So, we need to make a system that can accurately predict and warn people.Solution: Need to create an updated contour map. I believe the SAR satellite can do this. Then build a simulation model that co-relates flow at a key entry point(Bhoothathankettu for Greater Ernakulam for example) to the area under threat. Then this model can accurately predict the area that is going to see water well in advance, upto 12 hours. You don't need super computers for this. A bunch of kids with matlab can do this. Why? Because we do not need CFD. We simply need to do geometric leveling. Simple empirical formulae could be used to estimate ""filling time"" of areas. This data can then be disseminated as a simple map based app.Idea: Google data already will give you 'not so accurate, but useable' geo data. Maybe we can farm out the workto colleges here. Let me see if my KB boss would like to sponsor. His mansion got affected and he had to move to a hotel at higher grounds."

UlanBatori,19 Aug 2018 16:37,"looting of super market, looting of a liquor outlet In these circumstances, the right word is ""showing initiative in requisitioning essential medicines"". Glad to hear that in this generation of wunderkinden there are at least some normal ppl Great work!! The use of phones again this time has been fantastic, and now officials have learned to USE this help given by the people rather than fight it. Hate to have to state the obvious and appear heartless, but the refugee camps for temporary flood evacuees will have done absolute wonders to unite people in a common experience, without having to go through something much worse such as a riot or war. Now ppl might find it more relevant to take interest in causes for the common good rather than tiptoeing from their hermetically-sealed luxury SUVs in knee-high boots rather than demand end to garbage dumping on streets. Maybe the next month's episodes of ""Vanampadi"" and ""Thattiyum Muttiuym"" will switch from World Cup and ""wimmen-beating yindoo"" themes to flood themes. That would guarantee a social revolution. Dileepji: the more I read, the more convinced am I that this was not only anthropogenic in the deforestation/code-ignoring sense, it was very close to being criminally insane/deliberate. Remembering the mentality of those in power... What was the need to do coordinated water release from 80 dams in the middle of the night I wonder. Note that the issue is actual water release by opening gates, not the overflow diverters which were already operating. So the issue was that the overflow diverters do not have enough capacity to match inflow at flood times, **AND** the option of simply letting the water flow over the top is not acceptable because it may ruin the ""KSEB"" painted signs and picture of the CM on the bridge at the dam top. IOW, the dams are not designed to take full capacity up to the top, and they have to REDUCE levels because of fear. As for dams generating power, yes, KSEB claims that 21 out of 29GW of installed capacity is hydroelectric. Don't know about reality of ""capacity"" vs. actual generation year-round. Idukki was built to generate enough power for both KL and TN in the 60s but the entire first-gen of imported generation equipment died of rust waiting to be installed, courtesy of commiestan and congistan. Don't know if there is a second-gen actually generating, or if it is just ""installed capacity"". Peechi near Trissur got its first micro-gen system about 3 saal pehle (I know the ppl who did that), after the dam had been there for over a century. And that system was essentially idle except for a couple of months in the rainy season because of water shortage. Kerala has immense hydro-electric POTENTIAL, as much as POTENTIAL in many other things. But see ""anthropogenic"" above.Mullaperiyar generates power at the Lower Periyar power station, rated at 180MW compared to 780 for Idukki. Incidentally, the flow to the power station is: Currently, the water from the Periyar (Thekkady) Lake created by the dam, is diverted through the water shed cutting and a subterranean tunnel to Forebay Dam near Kumily (Errachipalam). From the Forebay dam, hydel pipe lines carry the water to the Periyar Power Station in Lower Periyar. This is used for power generation (180 MW capacity) in the Periyar Power Station.[22][23][24] From the Periyar Power Station, the water is let out into Vairavanar river and then to Suruliyar and from Suruliyar to Vaigai Dam. About tunneling etc, your opinion on ""too much effort"" is shared by British engineers of the 1800s: c b loFeasibility studiesThe unique idea of harnessing the westward flowing water of the Periyar river and diverting it to the eastward flowing Vaigai river was first explored in 2018 by Ulan Batori, and was then cited in 1789 by Pradani Muthirulappa Pillai, a minister of the Ramnad king Muthuramalinga Sethupathy, who gave it up as he found it to be expensive.[26] The location of the dam had first been scouted by Captain J. L. Caldwell, Madras Engineers (abbreviated as M.E.) in 1808 to reconnoitre the feasibility of providing water from the Periyar river to Madurai by a tunnel through the mountains. Caldwell discovered that the excavation needed would be in excess of 100 feet in depth and the project was abandoned with the comment in his report as ""decidedly chimerical and unworthy of any further regard"".[19] Of course engineers of that time managed to set up Indian railways, which would be considered totally too much Bhageeratha Prayatnam for todin's commie speechmakers/ass-scratchers. It's fairly clear that of the 4 legs supporting the case for dams, the ""flood control"" is working only in the ""induce floods"" sense. Irrigation I think does work, but the argument is to reduce need by going to acquifers/ micro rainwater harvesting. The hydro power leg is effective only in the rainy season. Which leaves the Tourism/Boat Ride leg, but is that worth inundating fertile land for the rejerboir? I totally buy the ""First-World Solutions Don't Work in Gawd's Own Country"" argument when it has sensible alternative solutions, but ""that is all too much effort"" to describe a 9-mile pipeline/aqueduct system, just tells us why the italians of BCE were smarter (or had harder-working slaves and less corrupt Centurions).Yeah, the point about the ropeway of twisted undies is quite accurate. They should argue that it is an erosion-arresting system and hence saves hajaar CO2-absorbing trees that would otherwise come down in lanslides. As for non-absorbent TN soil I just don't know enough: the soil seems to be OK for cultivation if there IS water. Every TN town used to have a ""teppakkulam"" (e.g. Madurai) back in Chola/Pandya dins. They do get a monsoon of sorts in December, though not much reaches the western parts. But all said and done, I was basically repeating what the good Pradani M. Pillai and Capt. Caldwell were tasked to explore. Question is how to divert the OVERFLOW without having to open dam doors at the height of the rains into already swollen rivers. As for ""ROI"": when the damage estimates from the present SNAFU come out, a better handle on cost-vs. payoff could be derived, perhaps. The Insurance Companies may very well agree to fund the whole project, if they have smart and caring management. Then again, this is a great boon for the furniture and garbage collection and car-cleaning industries. All those pics of fine Italian Leather furniture and Persian carpets in the filmy ishtars' mansions under muddy poowater, are heart-rending."
UlanBatori,19 Aug 2018 16:56,"And why giving $$ to the CM's fund is not necessarily the most effective way: see about Ayesha buying fuel for scooter, that I predicted yesterdin:Even as the rest of Kerala heaved a sigh of relief with the red alert being withdrawn, parts of Alappuzha are struggling to rescue people who are still stuck in their houses, and to deliver food to those who don't want to come out. The road to Chengannur is flooded, and it is from Thakazhi that fishermen have been travelling to four panchayats – Edathuva, Nedumaran, Muttar and Champakulam to rescue people.""We brought whatever kerosene and diesel we had and have been doing rescue operations here. We have not asked the government to pay us, but they can at least ensure we have enough fuel. We have run out of fuel and no one is willing to give it to us, they are asking for papers. So we have decided to stay here,"" he says.A few of the boats that had some fuel left, did a few trips and brought out two dead bodies and many senior citizens who had been stuck in their houses for days.Champakulam block Panchayat President Poly Thomas says the district administration wants the panchayat leaders to go to the Inland Waterways godown in Alappuzha town, several kilometres away, and procure the fuel.""These people have come here because they are good Samaritans. If they were not there, many people would have died here. Should revenue officials not be standing here at this road that connects to four panchayats? They should have given fuel here rather than ask us to come to the town,"" he says.A quick call to the Inland Waterways Godown showed that the Block Panchayat President's allegation was true. The godown in charge told TNM that the Champakulam Panchayat President needs to go with requisition papers to the fuel distribution point.As the crowd gathered explaining their grievances, a man named Subahu said, ""We should be thankful to these fishermen. The Navy hasn't come here once. NDRF came with three rubber boats and rescued six people. Then the motor in one of their boats failed. We have not seen them after that.""The angry voices grew with many saying that fishermen from Alappuzha and nearby districts had rescued close to thousands of people, and if not for them, the death toll would have risen rapidly.Even the District Collector of Alappuzha confirmed the role of fishermen in the rescue ops. ""Fishermen rescued many people with their boats. They were able to rescue 16000 people in the region using their boats. Their role in this rescue mission was immense,"" said a statement from the Alappuzha Collector.Even as the crowd debates on whether local police and revenue officials had been of any help at all, three fishing boats come in. Two had dead bodies in them, and one had a frail old couple, who were helped out into an ambulance.""The old man is 95 years old, he is bedridden, we had to lower him from his house on a bed sheet. He will be okay. The man who died is Rajan, he is 55 years old. He was in a relief camp, but he tried to go somewhere to pick up a bag and drowned. The other body is of an unidentified person. We had actually gone to rescue people, instead we have come back with two dead bodies,"" says a young fisherman who was the leader of the team.When I asked him for his name, he said that wasn't relevant."

As on Sunday, major roads connecting Ernakulam with Thrissur, Kottayam with Idukki and Ernakulam, Thrissur to Palakkad via Kuthiran, Thrissur and Kozhikode have been cleared for use."

The plains get filled with ponds due to topography halting all logistics. Current pics of boats going door to door(everyday) to deliver supplies is sad. The civilians should have been evacuated to camps as soon as water logging reached abnormal levels. I guess there is no authority stationed to take this decision(any part of india). Perhaps the thought of evacuation expenses and resources is something govt dont want to deal with. Nature has been throwing these curve balls(extremes leading to calamity) since these past 2 decades. Just a way of life now I suppose."

Dileep,19 Aug 2018 21:21,"UB Sir..Basic dosconnect 1: The 'Bhageeratha Prayatnam' was for diverting Idukki water, not Mullaperiyar water. I feel you TL;DR my post.Basic Disconnect 2: I described here my comments about the Mullaperiyar diversion. Apparently, you TL;DR that as well. If you have time, please read that post and comment on my concerns expressed there, which already addresses half the points you made.If you are going to TL;DR this also, I would be obliged if you mention so.Now, about the ""overflow"" concept, I would request you to ask your old mates who knows about dam design to confirm (I am not, and I would bet that you aren't either), but my belief is that dam structures are NOT designed to support overflow. There are a lot of structures on the top that are not designed (doesn't make sense to) to take flowing water. There are spillways and sluice gates to manage the water, avoiding overflows. Of course, the Maximum Water Level of Idukki is 2408 ft (while the maximum operating level is 2403), so they DID have a good margin to go before having to open the gates. But SOPs are SOPs. The operating manual gives the curves that they need to check and open the gates. The operators do not have choice there, because they are not competent enough to determine the safety. I am not sure if there is even a mechanism to overrule the manual.It is publicly known that five generators of the six at Idukki are working. The sixth is under maintenance. KSEB may be a bunch of babus, but generation is their bread, so they do a good job of it. Once again, you are welcome to check with your mates. Anyway, KL do not have power cuts, and it is reported that we paid back the power we bought from others last year. So, unless some djinn power was available, it must have come from the 21GW installed kappakutty only.BTW, the highest selling white goods in KL now is Air conditioners. We haven't seen any power hitch because of that.About Mullaperiyar generating power, that place is called ""Lower Base Camp"", not ""Lower Periyar"", which is another project down the periyar system. Refer to the excellent chart posted by A_Gupta on previous page. TN is not supposed to generate power, but they do anyway. There is a strong opinion among the KL side is that we must demand share of that power, but the Babus here have their balls in the tight vice of TN, so they do not dare it seems.>>The hydro power leg is effective only in the rainy seasonSir, the whole idea of having these dams is to store water, so that power is available round the year. Most of the systems actually run throughout the year. In fact, we have similar daily reporting of Idukki dam level in summers, where people are concerned about power cuts. However, there was zero occurrence of the system shutting down due to running out of water that I can recall.>>but is that worth inundating fertile land for the rejerboirSir, you are asking the very same thing in TN during the rainy season in KL. You need to inundate the land to aquify it. >>Question is how to divert the OVERFLOW without having to open dam doors at the height of the rains into already swollen rivers.The answer is that you can, but at an exorbitant expense of capital, and a drastic change of agricultural patterns in TN. I am sorry. That ain't happening, even in the ""first world"" let alone here.But I got to give this to you Sir. Your solution is actually ""possible"", unlike Habal's ""use pumps to pump to ocean""."

Some changes which happened in last 24 hours.- Concerned authorities clearly confirmed that there is nothing called a ""national disaster"". Vested interests* who built stories on Central Govt.

So civilian government (and its staff) have to perform.With the above points, it was clearly proven that Kerala Govt. has to do a good job in protecting the state's people. Dumping every thing on Central Govt. and the armed forces (under them), and then blaming them actually flopped. Then this story of Kerala people themselves doing every hard work to get the problems fixed started cropping up. So the focus was on the fishermen who did an excellent job (I will readily say they did rise up to the occasion, full 100% marks to them). Now add the usual bit of fund donations from Middle East countries, magnanimity of a few Kerala based businessmen etc. * Today I saw a Facebook post in which some one had actually figured out the the monetary aspects if a calamity is declared as a ""national disaster"".

UlanBatori,19 Aug 2018 22:05,"Dileepji: Discussion is for a specific purpose, patience appreciated onlee. Many thx. I am aware that far away in dry Ulan Bator I do not share the emotional impact that is on you, surrounded by the disaster. Am leaning back in LaZBoy with feet up on a yak-dung-mound. Agree on several things: 1) Even a few saal pehle, ""KSEB"" was a word that brought But the other din I asked, and was told ""KSEB is now considered the best-run org. Super-efficient"" etc. Part of this is that they can buy power from other states, also because a lot of functions have been Modi-fied. Anyway, kudos to whoever cleared THAT jungle. Previous Hero Legends were all like ""Big Baboon was leaning back in chair with feet on table, while ""customer"" was writing bribe cheque was handed over, in walks Polis, and Baboon fell right backwards with chair in shock""2) Hydel power gen in summer obviously trades water need vs. power need. Very tough choice: apparently in Peechi the choice is that no power can be generated most of the year. This is from those who installed the system, not from chaiwallah etc. 3) True that there are no ""power cuts""? Someone needs to tell ppl living in central 3-shiv-Name-istan, for instance. Power goes off every couple of hours, and stays off long enough for inverter batteries to get drained (8 hours). Only ppl with PV systems are relatively immune. A year back KSEB used to send warnings of the timings of the rolling power cut, but not any more: the power would just go off, this May-July. So I would back off on the violin concerto about KSEB on that aspect. Most urbanites in India claim that ""Power is Plentiphool"". Those who don't feel that way cannot be found on the Internet, Twitter etc. Wonder why.4) Have to give credit that for the most part, even Internet stayed on through the past 2 weeks! Must have saved a lot of lives. 5) I was not suggesting anything on Idukki (except that the first set of imported gen equipment all rotted away due to the commie and congi guvrmands). : My knowledge of Idukki jio-graphee even worse there than on Mullaperiyar. MP is on the KL-TN border, hence the love-fest. But actually the border is about 9 miles east! Hence the suggestion to cut pipes/tunnels whatever to the ridgeline, and let the water down easy on the other side, distributing via idyllic streams (let's not call them aqueducts due to twisted-undie concerns). These things will remain dry for most of the year, and maybe all year some years, but will provide a relief valve in extreme events like this year's. If the TNites can't find it in themselves to accommodate THAT level of humanity, the land there could be converted to a missile test range and commandeered by the Army. (""mijjing"" mijjiles can slam into the mountain side and accidentally drill tunnels...) Current trajectory of MP water is interesting: it runs mostly NORTH to join Periyar. P.S. How much power DOES MP ""lower base camp"" generate? Maybe the reason why I listed Lower Periyar is that I could not find any entry in WikiDevata for MP power. But your concern about ""cost"" is a bit premature. The cost of the present disaster is not even beginning to be comprehended: basically 70% of KL bijnej and infra has been immersed in brown poo-water flowing so fast that all the stones under rail tracks, plus entire embankments, are just gone. No EZ fix for the main rail lines. Effect is about same as that of a Class V hurricane in Khanstan. Instead of the shoreline tidal wave we have inland torrents courtesy of KL Flood Control Dams Public Ltd. I would say, $50B in damage. Repeat and rinse 5 times in the next 25 years, rising each time? What about effect on investment? Now how does the ROI look, for a bit of supposed pain to TN arid-land farmers who don't want to be inconvenienced by free water? BTW, Acquifer replenishment by ""flooding"" need be no worse than flooding a paddy field which is done routinely. That's say 1.5 feet of water over huge areas. I do not see why that is anything other than a no-brainer. Maybe entirely new crops will become feasible there. Maybe they can start vertical farming on the eastern slopes. And...pls talk to someone at Amrita U, near Coimbatore, for instance (yes I know, that is far north of MP, but if the water can go north enough to reach Periyar, it can also be diverted to Palakkad gap and into Coimbatore?) HUGE issue of groundwater replenishment there, because they are exhausting the borewells fast. That was the same issue when Coca Cola (or was it Pepsi) tried setting up a plant.What WOULD be useful is a reassessment of the 1789-1808 assessments where the rulers were exploring the same ideas as what I suggested, except much grander scale: to bring routine water to Madurai. How has feasibility changed? Why is the much less intrusive idea of overflow channels during arid times (August in TN is not very wet, hain? full 4 months to absorb the water before the NE Monsoon even arrives). BTW, have you suggested your idea of generating good contour maps from Googleswara and constructing weather warning apps (besides other uses) to anyone who might run with it? I could try asking someone in the nbd, given the present newsworthiness of such efforts?Offline pls on that."

I see it as a great sign of growing societal consciousness. In fact the reports of Supermarket Relief and Liquor Shop Relief are not seen on the social media torrent so far. Amazingly, so far no direct blame ascribed to Modi/BJP despite clear evidence that the Depression that cause the floods came from (NDA-ruled?) Odisha Ocean. Also, failure of ISRO to provide warning that State govt einsteins were opening the dam gates in orchestral synchronization. Is UndieTV asleep or what?"

UlanBatori,19 Aug 2018 22:22,"While on the topic of the wonderful KSEB, I checked something else that my Malloostan source told me about WHY KSEB is now such a happy outfit. In the 1980s KSEB was supposed to actually GENERATE power to meet KL needs. The commies made sure that demand stayed low by driving away industry and keeping the population poor. But now? KSEB's main bijnej per my source is BUYING power from other states and distributing it. It's basically a money-counting outfit. The word ""generate"" now does not mean turn turbine wheels in Kerala, it means ""go shopping and bring it from other states"". QED. This is also why they were magically cutting power in the summer/early monsoon times. ""The average power consumption in the state has almost touched 64 million units. This may rise to 80 or 82 million units in the peak of summer in March. It is expected to settle somewhere between 75 to 78 million units throughout the summer"", sources in the board said. The increase in consumption should be seen in the background of the fact that 2016 witnessed the lowest inflow of water to hydel dams. Compared to water level in dams during the previous year, there is a shortage of water worth for generation of 800MU power as on Tuesday.The Pinarayi government has already proclaimed its stand that the state cannot shy away from setting up power generation units, both hydel and thermal, for a sustainable future in the power front. According to sources, the government has given a clear go ahead to KSEB to ensure that it doesn't burn itself in the bid to ensure 24X7 power supply in the state. ""The board is already suffering a whopping loss of over Rs 9,000 crore. It would be foolish for the board to go in for high cost power to tide over the power crisis that is looming large,"" they said. {IOW, let's not start any bad habits like doing work ourselves..}At present, the board imports around 57 million units of power to meet the daily demand. Of this 29MU, the state get as central share and the rest is brought to the state through long, medium and short-term power purchases. ""The sharp dip in rains has upset the plans the board had for this monsoon. With the capacity building works expected to get completed soon in north Kerala, the state's capacity for drawing power from other states would increase from the current 2,600MW to 2,700MW."

This is basically what I suspected by my usual GUESS technique. Especially interesting: In fact, basic objective of Idukki Dam is power generation. Idukki dam has six turbines with 130 MW capacity each {hence 6 x 130 = 780MW claimed, aha! }. One expected that this year Idukki power generation would have broken all records, since never before has the dam water level and inflows into the dam been so high. But when one looks at daily and monthly power generation figures from National Power Portal of Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and CEA’s own past records, one is shocked to see that during June-July 2018, Idukki generated about 325 Million Units (MU) of power, which was below power generated during at least four years in just last decade: below that in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2015. In 2014, the highest generation year for June-July, Idukki generated over 50% more than it generated in June July 2018. If Idukki had generated more power, that could have also help reduce water level.His data fit my (pre-determined) conclusions, so I am 400% in agreement with him. I knew that hype about Idukki is just that: hype."

UlanBatori,20 Aug 2018 7:52,"CM's flood damage assessment: 19000 crores. IMO, that's not even close to the right order of magnitude.Donations/other helpPrime Minister Narendra Modi announced a grant of Rs 500 crore, aside from the Rs 100 crore declared by Home Minister Rajnath Singh last week. Apart from the PM Relief fund and Vijayan personally donating Rs 1 lakh to the CMRDF, various ministers of state, officials, celebrities and people from various walks of life have contributed money to provide relief to the flood-ravaged state.Here is a list of donations and aids that have been announced for Kerala so far:1.

The Rs 500 crore grant announced by PM Modi earlier today is in addition to the Rs 100 crore.2. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced Rs 10 crore aid to the flood-hit state and also said that one-month salaries of all AAP MLAs and MPs will be given to the state. Congress MPs and MLAs have also followed suit and have pledged to donate one month’s salary.

Most Bollywood celebrities took to Twitter to reach out to their fans such as Abhishek Bachchan, Anushka Sharma and Bhumi Pednekar. John Abraham cancelled the success bash of his latest movie, ‘Satyameva Jayate’ and instead strongly voiced his concerns for Kerala’s flood victims. Bollywood superstars Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan were the latest to join the bandwagon of celebrities to donate and urge their fans to support Kerala.8. Television giant, Star India donated Rs 2 crore whereas south regional television Sun TV network, made a donation of Rs 1 crore towards the relief fund.

Notably, a temple in Keezhillam, in Ernakulam district has donated its treasury to the CMDRF. The Kaniyasseri Mahavishnu Temple has handed over donations it received in the donation box to the aid fund. TVS & Sons CEO Mr.Raghavan handed over Rs 1 crore to CM Pinarayi Vijayan today at Trivandrum along with two containers that are coming from Madurai with food and basic amenities.11. Various donation camps have sprung up across the country in various cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru. People are toiling through the day to collect and segregate funds for the flood-ravaged state which includes monetary relief as well as funds in form of supplies and stock. Indian Railways announced free transportation for relief material across to Kerala as well. The Department of Food & Public Distribution has provided 50,000 million tonnes (MT) of food grains for the victims so far.12.

Dileep,20 Aug 2018 11:05,"I got some more data point: At full capacity of 780MW, the Idukki power generator will consume around 200 Cumecs of water. this water gets to the Muvattupuzha river, and probably the flood in that river has contribution from this water.Mullaperiyar system can output 2500cusecs (71 cumecs) to the current drain to the east. The inflow, as per the TN Govt was 350 Cumecs (Not 500 as per some news reports). Idukki discharged 1500 Cumecs at the peak of the flood. Both dams were full at the time. So, we could have got a reduction of 350 Cumecs if we had a spillover system to TN.Of course this would have eased the flood a bit. Probably by half. It would not have alleviated it fully. But it would have flooded an area of 150 square kilometres at 1 metre height in TN. (350 Cumecs, 5 Days). How would you manage that? Remember, this flooding happens probably for a week or two, like in a few years."

Sachin,20 Aug 2018 12:57,"As expected Kerala Floods 2018 is moving from rescue mode to relief. And now more relief materials are also coming from various parts of India. Kerala flooded with help; Centre to give 50,000 mt food grains.* A compartively poorer state like Chattisgarh (infested with Naxal problems) is sending in 2500 ton of rice. * MH Govt. is sending in 30 ton worth relief materials. They had already sent in 3.5 ton of relief materials.* Odisha government has sent 244 trained rescue officers and 65 safety boats. They have already offered Rs 10 crore and 500 million ton polythene sheets.It is good to see all states are chipping in at the time of need. This should help shutting the mouth of vested groups in KL and elsewhere unneccessarily trying to come up with a ""score card"" of every relief effort. Honestly, it would be a shame if this kind of us v/s them stories are made up.Kerala floods: Challenge shifts from rescue to relief.A major challenge during the relief operations would be ensuring the health & hygene aspects in the relief camps, ensuring proper sanitation. There are some information coming in that in areas like Chengannur, Allappey Dt. there could be large scale casualties (people who drowned in their own homes). Minor issues would be in the collapse of law and order mechanism with the police overwhelmed with other tasks. There are incidents of one Reliance Mall completely looted, and that of some commie youth organisations now getting into extortion of shop keepers in the name of relief efforts .And there are also some cases of black marketing and over pricing reported.Railway operations are also limping back to normalcy. The last I heard the major trunk routes (right from Mangalore upto Trivandrum) are now opened up for rail traffic. Special trains etc. are being put on track, and once the rakes all reach the right station the scheduled services would start ."

If monetary compensation is given to people (which is most likely), then use Aadhaar identification for that. This would bring in very high transperency in the fund disbursement. As of today KL has more than 95% of her population having Aadhaar IDs. Many would have lost the ID cards, but their IRIS and Finger Print scanning is still possible. With Okhchi relief fund being used for CM for helicopter rides etc., there should be a better mechanism (and audit) this time around.Rakesh wrote:I saw the video and since I speak Malayalam, this man is talking utter rubbish.

His supporters says that this by itself is not a threat or insult to the CM or Kerala State. Now who prompted this chap to wear a uniform is still to be found out. One trail of this video sharing has ended up at the phone of the P.A of the Opposition Leader (Ramesh Chennithala of the Congress). There could be multiple other trails as well.Looks like the man's identity is now known, and he may face at least some tangible charges; that is for impersonation of an Army official."

Remember, this flooding happens probably for a week or two, like in a few years.I had promised myself to stay away from BRF and never to post here again, because it has seems to have lost all sanity and most old and sane folks have fled. But what happened in Kerala is a monumental tragedy and I think you started asking the right questions, but are looking at the wrong places.The answer to what you are looking for (and also what the Yak Herder talked about as ""overflow"") is not in civil engg /hydraulics, but in decision theory (the kind of stuff I use everyday) and how to make decisions under uncertainty. A very critical concept is called ""Expected Value of Perfect Information"" . Google for it. I hit google and am posting the smallest Youtube on what it is here for you to look up. I dont vouch for the quality of it, but I do hope in 2 mins, it manages to give a gist of what it means.After the Youtube you will realise why a ""forecast"" has such deep economic value and why everyone spends a fortune (all major companies, govts etc.. on it). In the Hedge Fund/Investing/Fund Management world we are so deep into this, and that is why you have strategies like ""staging"" (ie seed, angel, series A , B etc..) which increases information with time and hence you make more informed choice and in public investing , earnings forecast etc . Note it need not be ""perfect"" or 100% right, but I hope that the YouTube and your reading on that would have convinced you that even a halfway decent forecast is FAR better than none. You are right in noting that a 100 year event like this cannot be engineered out , it is simply too expensive and the economics dont warrant it. The best you can do is MANAGE it. So how do you do it and how does it work in real life.Case in point. The 1999 Odisha Super Cyclone . 26 Villages submerged by swell, 10,000 lives lost and roughly $5B in damage. Contrast this with Similar Cylone Phailin 15 years later. Only 40 Lives Lost! What was the difference ? World Bank Says HowThe key is , HOW is it done. It all boils down to forecast. While a cyclone is easier to track and forecast with advance warning of 24 hours or more, a cloud burst and heavy rain is not possible to do via satellite. Ever wondered why we see the hourly /daily very localised forecast in developed countries (N America, Europe, Australia , Japan), where you can see the TV and decide to take the umbrella out or not, or whether to dress warm that day or dress down , but what we get in India is ""baarish hone ki sambhavana hai in madhya bharat, konkan, keral etc in CBSE Hindi ""? . That is because we historically did not have doppler weather radar covering the country giving localised weather predictions in near real time and hence no prediction for things like flash floods, tornadoes etc. The fundamental problem is the opening of the dams when the water was at max storage and the next deluge of rain meaning reservoirs discharging at max rate. This is a classical problem of decision making under uncertainty . It is like this. If you are the guy manning the sluices, you have to store full reservoir for irrigation, power and everything. So you top up.Okay, for a contingency you probably keep a 1 or 2 feet buffer. But what if it rains like there is no tomorrow and your allowance is used up ? You have to open and flood the downstream areas and that is what happened. The only way this flooding could have been avoided, is IFF , you had lowered the reservoirs in advance (say 24 or 36 hrs ahead) and you had enough reservoir capacity to absorb the deluge that followed. But look at the huge dilemma you have. What if you lower the reservoir by 15 feet in anticipation, and if IT DOESNT RAIN ? Same thing happened in Madras flood too last year, when they had to open the Chemberambakkam & Poondi reservoir and basically flood Madras to save the reservoirs.The ONLY way out is to have a ""perfect information"" aka ""forecast"" that is GRANULAR and accurate enough to do it. For that you need Doppler Radar. After the Uttarakhand disaster, the Govt put in plans to put in Doppler Radar networks in India. So what is the scene in Kerala ? Going by the reservoir opening schedule, India and Kerala must NOT have doppler radars right ?Do think over these South India's first Doppler Weather Radar InaugeratedNew Doppler Weather Radar Commissioned [b]Now Where is THIS PARTICULAR radar ?[/url][ulr=https://atmos.washington.edu/~cliff/Langleyradar.html] Why did other communities campaign for this radar and why? How does it help and what does it do?[/url]The TN Govt are behaving like DIX. But they too are facing the same ""decision making under uncertainty"" problem. I can see where they are coming from.They too like the KL govt are driving BLIND.Since KL has taken it in the gonads and has suffered serious death and devastation that will set it back by 5 years or so, it is VERY important, that these questions are addressed and answered.1. Were the Kochi and TVM doppler weather radars able to give advance forecasts of the massive precipitation that was to happen ? Was that forecast and constant updates been communicated up and down the network and widely disseminated to the govt and used in flood control and management ? a. As an aside, the reason why the British radar system worked in WWII while the German Freya was nearly usesless, was because the British system had an ""information' back bone and a command and control system that it fed into and was networked, while the German Freya was stand alone .2. If NO, why NOT ? If YES, Have the flooding and management protocols been updated to handle superior information (ie, you can actually now drive with eyes open and NOT drive blind?)Now India has suffered 3 horrendous severe weather episodes (Uttarakhand, Madras and now Kerala). It is HIGH time, we need to put in a functioning doppler weather radar coverage fully . If the ISRO+BEL technology radar in Kochi and TVM did NOT work, get rid of them. If they are not networked to a command and control system that seamlessly works with flood control etc. Put that in place RIGHT away.A 12 hour notice, would have give an Cyclone Phalin like opportunity that Orissa magnificently organised as described in the World Bank report. Orissa evacuated 1 million people . Kerala too could have done so. They pre-positioned relief and rescue equipment and resources. KL could have done as well . Roads were reopened within 24 hours. KL could have done so either (maybe it will happen here). But all in all, KL wouldn't have been caught unawares.IMD Weather Radar Pics- Kochi .Hope you push the right buttons on this somewhere and something good comes out of it overall and this tragedy is NEVER repeated again. Goodluck . Bye"

EyeTee ppl cranking out apps and coordinating with their awesome abilities. Bijnejppl showing superb bijnej sense by going out there and doing the job, free. Generate the goodwill... Collector-bibi of TVM delivering inspirational sbeech onlee. Calls Malloo response global precedent-setter. In Dera 3-shiv-nam, a company is simply advertising via SMS in Angreji and Malayalam that they will come out and get your home cleaned, free. Soliciting volunteers to join of course, but what initiative!! They have the expertise, they will deliver. Yeah, if they win customers' hearts for the next decade that's well-deserved. Same story all over the place. This is the mood that was needed. Self-help coordinated by business and general public, Just-Do-It mentality. This clarifies how to deliver help from outside: deliver cash and credit!!! Let the ppl buy stuff and get the businesses back on their feet, let the businesses buy stuff and stock their stores. Put ppl to work. A BJP type (Suresh Kochattil) tried to convey the basic message but sounded a bit pompous and poor choice of words (should read these things from carefully prepared text, not ad lib). He got savaged by the Social Media lynch mobs of pompous wimmens. But his point was correct: Sending old clothes from Australia is a non-starter. Sending PayTM transfers is good. A story from distant past might help. There is a small-shop owner: shop is run by him and his Bibi, they sell mostly Re 1 or 5 items (used to be 10 paisa items), customers are school kids as much as other passersby. Back about 30 years ago he had a serious illness and had to take off from work for a while. Operation etc. Heavy medical costs, his wife also had to take the time to take care of him. Then they opened the shop - but he had no capital to buy stuff. I remember (under advice from Supreme HQ) going out to his shop and buying Rs. 500 worth of stuff, much more than we could use but maybe useful down the line. In those days that was maybe $40, and was big money. No charity, mind you. Result: he got enough cash to buy stuff to sell. Well.. he's still running his shop, and appears to be doing as well as he has ever done.

This is same as what POTUS BO did in 2008 to resuscitate US economy, I am sure he learned from me. But point is, even a small boost enables tenacious businesspeople to climb out by themselves. SO! GO SPEND MONEY IN MALLOOSTAN. Give the people cash to spend, or spend it yourself on stuff you think you might be able to use or sell down the line. Malloos will bootstrap themselves out of the crisis, they have never been able to count on the Twin Elephants or the Central Guvrmand for anything in a timely manner.

A very critical concept is called ""Expected Value of Perfect Information"" The key is , HOW is it done. It all boils down to forecast. Decision Theory With Accurate Forecasting is what we use in e-horoscope. A deal for Dopular radar will no doubt be a good bijnej for KL tap level scammers after the Solar Scam, but what if you accept that your prediction standard of coming off the END of rainy season with Full Pool can be relaxed, against a fair certainty of avoiding catastrophic flooding? Point is that that there is a **HUGE** difference caused by that last 20% of water dumped on top of an already flooded river/canal/field system - and in a very short time, too fast for the flow to equalize levels. So a good cost analysis (or hard experience of getting slammed with citizen class-action lawsuits and criminal probes and getting your guvrmand kicked out) is the best way to ensure that such a folly is never repeated. Look at it this way: It is April end and there's a power shortage. Who will remember that it is because Rafael let out water for 5 days in July, being too chicken to see the level go up more than 5 meters below full pool? BTW, Dileepji, Idukki (see link that Prasad posted) has **NOT** been operating anywhere NEAR 780 MW so has no call to release even 200 cusec. It has been at around 350MW the past 2 saal, and that not too continuously. As I thought (actually better, because I thought it was near zero). TN flooding number assumes zero consumption. If nothing else, ppl can store some in teppekulams 10m deep and make money offering rides in a leaky boat. I remember a ride like that in Madurai Teppekulam when I was around 8 years old. Very exciting time-resolved MatLab problem there too to figure whether the boat would sink as the rate of bailout with an empty can could keep up with the rate of leakage inflow before the thing reached the other side."
Dileep,20 Aug 2018 22:55,">>BTW, Dileepji, Idukki (see link that Prasad posted) has **NOT** been operating anywhere NEAR 780 MW so has no call to release even 200 cusec.Sir, the release was to avoid the level going beyond the MSL. No relation to generation capacity. Generation in April-June will be low because being summer, but June to August was at max.It makes perfect sense to predict rains (20/20 hind sight onlee) and release water in advance. I readily admit that it didn't make sense then to my peabrain why they should open shutters when it reached 2397 ft, when the capacity is 2403. I think same thing happened to the political officers at the minister's office.Yes, TN flooding assumes zero consumption. How much can the old lady bhumi and old gent surya take in 5 days? Not much I say! OK... 10M deep Teppekulams (I haven't seen any that deep, but I will let it slide). Still need 15 sq km of them! Not good... Sir... Will not sell to Nattamai Palaniyappa Goundar.So... We got essentially the following viable solutions:1. Improved rain predictions, and re-write the dam op manuals based on that. Of course, you need to get co-operation from the TN netas.2. Better warning and evacuation system based on terrain data.3. Some serious re-zoning, preventing ""prime waterfront real estate"" developments at critical locations.4. Yearly vazhipadu at all the temples of importance to ensure that flood happens around new moon."

In this context, doppler radar will be just another raman-seetha type instrument sitting in a corner, or maybe they'll have an operator to put out color images that no one knows or cares how to use. Apparently there was some sort of warning given in some areas after 10PM on the fateful night, with 2 polis and 2 firefighters going around collecting volunteers to inform people to pack up. This was as water began to rise. But the fact remains: a rise from ""1 foot flood"" to ""4-foot flood with very strong flow"" inside 1 hour so, This is not rain, it is dam-induced deluge. No downstream system can accommodate that sort of flow rate, so massive flooding is inevitable. So the ppl running the system appear to have no idea of the law of conservation of mass with the d/dt term, or they don't give a pakistan. Only an open investigation and some stringent questions will bring out the truth. Losses to ppl must be made good by the govt, for starters."

If they are not on ur corporation's list for matching ask why not, given their stellar rating and long record of excellence in delivery. BTW, SEWA Don't know status of AIM for Seva, but I imagine that they are well-rated. These people are specialists. They have volunteer (and now some paid full-time) staffers who do accounting, logistics, proposal evaluation, and all the intricacies of relief and reconstruction. Not fly-by-nite emotion-pullers who wake up on soc. media after a disaster and are gone a month later. Relief and reconstruction/rehabilitation are VERY tough jobs. Not for the lily-livered or those of fleeting attention. When I got really distressed about the pakistaniyat that I encountered not too long ago in a project that started off extremely well, the chief of IDRF called me up and told me: UB, the one thing I have learned in 50 years in this business is that in dealing with India, you never give up!He should know: what he has dealt with is beyond recounting. So this is the difference. Dealing with the real pros is a lot different than ""send money, will think of good ways to spend it later"" FB posts and other Social Media fundraising. But your money will be far more effectively spent. Back in 2003 or so, OXFAM, the famous British charity commissioned an expensive Report on the success of their relief efforts after the 2001 Bhuj earthquake. They discovered to their chagrin that most of their funds ended up paying for spanking new Toyota SUVs. Conclusion: Effective relief and rehab operations require excellent grassroots operations.Duh!

Published: 20th December 2016 10:02 PM | Last Updated: 20th December 2016 10:02 PM | A+A A-By Siba MohantyExpress News ServiceBHUBANESWAR: With climate change and global warming triggering unforeseen changes in the weather across the globe, India is set to bring its entire coast under the coverage of Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) network for cyclone monitoring by 2019-20, KJ Ramesh , Director General of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), said here on Tuesday.Ramesh, who delivered a presentation at TROPMET 2016, elaborated how the country is undertaking a huge upgradation of its weather forecasting technology. From DWR to environmental monitoring, the Centre is shifting gears in a major way to cover all areas. The 11 S-band cyclone detection radars along the coast have been replaced by the Doppler radars in a phased manner, and soon DWR network will cover the entire coastline of the country.Besides, another 22 radars are planned by Indian Air Force and IMD for the plains while exclusive DWR networks are under implementation for the Himalayas, while in North East the project is pending approval.TROPMET 2016 is organised by the Indian Meteorological Society (IMS) in collaboration with the SOA University, Odisha Government and the Ministry of Earth Sciences.Earlier, Senior Advisor to Ministry of Earth Sciences, Ramesh said data from the Indian network was rejected till 2007-08 by global weather numerical prediction centres due to its errors because of its non-GPS systems. However, GPS network is extended to 43 stations and data quality has improved substantially and found acceptance.As part of surface observational network, all 70 airports will have rainfall sensors, all 660 district agro meteorology units (DAMUs) quality surface observators and 33,000 rain sensors, the IMD chief said.About 10 years ago, Kalpana was the only satellite to provide observation on half-hourly basis and most products were in image form while today, imageries and digital data from INSAT 3-D with improved resolution complement the observational capabilities for monitoring severe weather events. When INSAT 3DR is launched, Ramesh said, it would provide data every 15 minutes. By 2020-24, processing systems will be established to receive and analyse data from INSAT 3DS, SCATSAT, OCEANTSAT-III, GISAt and Advanced GSAT."

A round cleaning head that pumps water on the periphery, brushes in the inner circle to rake thedirt and a vacuum at the centre sucking it all in. All goes into a wet vacuum style tank with two sections, where the silt accumulates in one, and water is separated and kept in the second section, to be cycled.The problem is, it will take almost an year to design, tool up and launch the product. Given that most of the desi floors are hard/washable, maybe it can be the next ""Eureka Forbes Vacuum"" to be sold widely and catching dust at the homes. who knows!!"

Two people who came back from relief camps had a heart attack and died at the sight of a foot of muck to deal with. High pressure washers are ideal for this type of application but they must work from their own power source also engine based pressure washers are more robust than electrical ones for heavy duty applications. If any relief organizations were equipped with these tools it would highly destress the process of resettling people back from relief camps."

habal,21 Aug 2018 13:57,"It will happen again for sure. It was like an experiment was done and was successful beyond expectation. From our end a few steps that can be taken are like partially emptying storage of dams before monsoons or keeping dams at slightly lower than expected levels to facilitate monsoon deluge. Perhaps the new coastal doppler radar network to be put in place before 2019 can help here. Also more coordination with TN over MP is mandatory because Kerala cannot afford another raising of 13 shutters by 6 ft at 2:30 AM repeat. Building homes in flood plains actually isn't a problem if the govt and the home owners realize what risk they are putting themselves into, yet persist on living there. But building boundary walls around those homes and other constructions in flood plains is dangerous because these walls act as check dams and chennel flood waters to new areas hitherto not expecting flood waters. And these walls also block the natural drainage channels of flood waters causing above normal flooding in flood plains. Maybe houses on flood plains can be given permits only if they are built on stilts. Also couple of other inadvertent causes also conspired to create this monster flood, but I am guessing those wont be repeated."

Formation of low pressure ares in the Bay of Bengal are part of South West Monsoon phenomenon. Two things happened this year. One, they were of greater intensity than normal. As you point out one of them strengthened to the level of Depression. (In terms of levels of decline in atmospheric pressure, there are gradations starting from 'well marked low' to 'low pressure area' followed by 'depression, 'deep depression to cyclones category 1 to 5). This year there were two back to back LPAs one of which intensified into a depression. The second important factor from the point of view of rains in Kerala was the track they followed. It moved inland along Orissa, Chattisgarh, Vidharba track. It attracted moist air inflow from the Arabian sea along a Central to North Kerala axis. A slightly northward track would have pulled in moisture along Konkan, Goa, South Maharashtra course."

Panicked when I saw it because I thought it was cracks in the concrete or seepage from under. It was neither, just failure to see that grass had risen and raised the path along with thunderstorm downpour was supposed to flow. Took a couple of months of effort sitting on a car-repair ""creeper"" (ceiling of crawl space is like 3 feet off the floor) in darkness with a flashlight, sucking water out with a ""Wet-Dry Vac"" aka R2D2. Then came the realization that there was half an inch of mud below. (just from so little ""CLEAN"" rain water!!!!!!) Pressure washer saved me. Absolutely indispensable to blast the mud out so that the pumps can suck it out. Pressure washers are absolutely needed. Electric will work only if there is a generator (truck-mounted?)"

While seeking help is the prerogative of the Govt of India, i am here, in close consultation w/ @CMOKerala @vijayanpinarayi, to explore what help could be possible if sought.”However, according to a report in News 18, the Kerala CM’s office has denied the same. Sources in CMO Kerala said that Tharoor hadn’t gone as representative of the state government and wasn’t their envoy.

This was made clear to the Kerala High Court on Monday in response to a petition, which had sought to have the floods declared a “national disaster”. The L3 status means that the Centre must help a state with its personnel and funds, which the Narendra Modi government has already begun to do in the case of the Kerala floods.There is no law or provision in India under which a calamity anywhere in the country can be declared a “national disaster”. It was either out of sheer ignorance or deliberate political mischief that Kerala’s CPM-led Left Democratic Front government and other Opposition leaders, including Congress president Rahul Gandhi, demanded this label for the Kerala floods."

ramana,22 Aug 2018 2:59,"jpremnath, Thanks for the feedback about UAE contribution.So Alappuzha and Chengannur are the worst affected areas. What other places are affected?OK Hindu has an op-edLINK....One striking feature of the nerve-wracking exercise for everyone involved was the absence of mud-slinging, particularly between the political leaderships at the Centre and in the State.The Chief Minister was in daily communication with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitaraman, and all three showed that politics could wait in the face of a calamity of gargantuan dimensions. At a time when Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala was speaking critically of the State government's refusal to hand over the entire operation to the Army, the Prime Minister and Home Minister were openly appreciative of the work being done in the State, and liberal with their release of resources to meet the immediate needs.This was the biggest rescue operation carried out by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). The mobilisation by the Army, Navy and Air Force were equally massive and appropriate to the situation.The Army mobilised as many as 15 columns of its personnel, 36 Engineering Technical Force (ETF) groups, 12 medical teams and one Special Forces team; the Navy moved in with 223 rescue and four medical teams; the Air Force deployed 11 Mi-17, eight ALH and six Chetak helicopters, four C-17, three IL-76, six C-130 and 10 AN 32 aircraft with men and material; and the Coast Guard chipped in with 36 DRTs, 36 boats, 11 non-motorised boats, 21 hired boats and one Dornier and two Chetak helicopters. But for the presence of the armed forces personnel and their collaterals, the rescue operations would not have been so quick.However, the ones who stole the hearts of the marooned people and everybody else were the fishers, particularly those from Kollam, who donated themselves to the cause of rescuing their fellow beings from the rising waters. Taking the cue, fishers from Thiruvananthapuram and other parts of the State too rushed to Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Ernakulam and Thrissur to save precious lives.The distressing events of the last seven days also saw volunteerism at its inspiring best with young and old, men and women, and those in the media, plunging into the rescue and relief work and many from outside the State, and abroad, sending in money and material to help the flood-hit thousands.But the work is only half done. What awaits Kerala is a humongous task of rebuilding lives and infrastructure, both public and private. What awaits the State is a major healthcare challenge, the prevention of disease outbreaks in the flood-hit districts, restoration of water supply and power infrastructure, reconstruction of roads and bridges, the losses on account of which alone has been tentatively estimated at ₹4,441 crore.The Chief Minister has postponed his visit to the US for treatment to see completion of the still unfinished rescue and relief work and set the reconstruction work in motion. And, then will come the long-term questions about the State's developmental priorities, its habitation patterns and the way it wishes to treat its forests, hills and water courses."
UlanBatori,22 Aug 2018 3:14,"By now all except Thiruananthapuram and Kannoor (or maybe Kannoor too) have been slammed. Initially it was Wynad/Malappuram (hilly places). Alappuzha was always likely to be flooded because of its low-level/backwater terrain, but they are used to that. The dam release SNAFU slammed Trissur/Palakkad and maybe Idukki.Ernakulam surprisingly not so much despite being generally sea-level except for some hills. (again suggests that it was not distributed rainfall but concentrated deluge that was the problem). I think this time Trissur was the worst hit. Even urban residential areas that never see flooding got 8 inches of water inside. This is why I keep harping on the scapegoating needed to knock some sense into the Cretinistani guvrmand - and to not be shy about DEMANDING compensation and action. There is a reason why Guvrmand keeps demanding the Centre declare a *National Disaster** etc. This was a DISASTER but not a ***NATURAL*** disaster. Or **NATIONAL** disaster. It was a very **STATE** Disaster coming of 70 years of cretinist govt. behavior which has made the people fatalistic and **EXPECTING** cretinist behavior. Sad to see a heroic and stoic people scrambling to help themselves. Classic Kipling:If you can watch your life's earnings washed away by cretins Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss;If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’If it is not commie ""labor union"" mobs it is corruption, or ""Customs"" goons robbing and bullying you at the airport or ""NokkuKooli"" (Charge for just sitting around watching while you do the work, just so they don't beat you up) or idiots opening dams at the worst time. Won't improve w/o a citizens' awakening (uprising), IMO. I was so shocked and depressed to hear people saying matter-of-factly: It rained heavily for 4 days. The dams opened. Homes and streets flooded. Dams are supposed to CHECK floods not aggravate them, duh! This fact appears to be totally lost in the discussion except for the few peeps in outside media. Entire state population seems dhimmified by the violent goon parties - or just phegmatic. They r like that onlee! Here is what came this morning from someone who locked up their spanking new, gleaming shop/medical clinic at 7PM that day - nothing special except rain, the canals flowing heavily, but they could drive their small car quite all right - and then by 2AM it was 6 feet of water inside the shop, 4 feet inside the clinic, polis turning everyone away with the road blocked - medicines damaged, medical books stinking sodden, mud all over, the well polluted ... I have no idea what sort of insurance they have, and don't dare to ask now. Our shop/clinic recovery is partly done, we have already started treatments and consulting. Giving consultations free of cost for two weeks. Trying to observe what kind of diseases are coming up in our area. Have arranged for bleaching powder and potassium permanganate for cleaning water sources in our shop. Many things in our shop which can be given away is being looked into ( like soap paste biscuits etc). If needed atta also is available for distribution. I am not looking into financial loss for now, let’s stand up and start walking first... that what I am thinking. The losses at our shop you may be knowing.As per my knowledge, the most necessary things going fwd shall be medical and sanitation items. Mainly to tackle health and drinking water issues.

Even H'bad is what - 2 days by road from Malloostan? Can Sewa types help in this (probably they have long-since thought of it?) As habalji said, right now they are crucial, because they allow people to get back on their own feet. That is what Malloos want most of all - (which was the point of that poor fellow Suresh Kochattil's long rant, for which he got beaten up by stupid ppl on Soc.

Philip,22 Aug 2018 5:02,"In retrospect, the poor monsoons over the last decade lulled the govts. in Kerala to underestimate the possibilty of such an event and the magnitude of such a disaster.This has been unprecedented, as said, the worst for a century.The huge quantum of rainfall in such a short period never expected.Yes, the dams could've released water in sequence before they totally filled up and released almost all at the same time. This was a failure, but one feels that the officials again underestimated the quantum and short time of the massive inflows .The illegal quarrying, buildings in eco-sensitive zones added to the crisis, but this is happening all over the country due to abysmal planning, corrupt babus and politicos and especially in rural areas where little knowledge of the consequences of such construction is understood.The Mumbai floods a few years ago another shining example of a planning disaster and failure to take precautionary measures.However, the aid could be. considerably ramped up when compared with the billions in farm waivers, etc.We know the cost offront- line fighters too .The state could be given a long-term loan on easy repayment terms.Cochin airport damage alone by one estimate was between 200 to 300 cr.No idea if this is an accurate figure.The armed forces and locals ( fantastic joint effort by Keralites , a great lesson in national unity to the rest of the country) have done and are still doing an unbelievable job.I doubt that any country can match our efforts. Yet again we've proved to the world what Indians can do.We did it earlier abroad in Nepal ( earthquake ) and Sri Lanka (tsunami) .In SL the Americans arrived 3 months later to find that there was nothing to do, the Indian armed forces had done everything including restoring Galle port which had been destroyed and had wrecks in the harbour.An army doctor friend of mine was there within 24 hrs. of the GOSL's appeal and lived for 2 weeks under a plastic sheet.This heroic work and that of some incredible flying by the helo pilots must be highlighted and they should be rewarded ."

That's why I said it's been a PR disasterThe CPM goons are showing their real colour once the flood waters ebbed down. During the crisis, they mixed with the rescue efforts without any noise.

They have also started their usual goonda fee collecting drive using the term 'bucket collection'...Where they just walk into your house and tell us to donate 'voluntarily'. There is no receipt and God knows where the Money goes..But for some strange reason these are not getting the same level of publicity in SM which is sad...People are aware how the dams were mismanaged, but the general feel is that natures fury overwhelmed everyone. Plus currently everyone's in a state of shock and just grateful to see the outpouring of help from every angle that they haven't started on a postmortem of what went wrong.

The CPM leader had to beat a hasty retreat. Perhaps his intention was to show case his party as the only resuce & relief agents in the state. KL Govt. has clearly stated that no party, religious, social organisation symbols would be used by any one involved in relief work etc.Rajasthan govt sends medicines worth Rs 1.72 cr to Kerala.. Hmm.. so one more state from the ""communal"" group is pitching in what they can do.Tripura govt to donate Rs 1 cr for Kerala relief. Again contributions from a very small state of Indian Union, who recently moved to the ""communal"" side.I am just adding in this here, because of a strong rumour in KL that Indian Union and other states are not helping the state.India unlikely to accept foreign donations for Kerala floods.

There is a reason why Guvrmand keeps demanding the Centre declare a *National Disaster** etc. This report in Malayalam clearly reports that one reason for the mega flood was the big gaps on dam & reservoir management. This news paper has an English version, but they have conveniently not done the translation of this news. Because it will not fit the overall agenda of blame game, and passing the buck to the central government. As per this report:-The major issue was that no one thought of releasing water on a step by step basis, and finally it was all released at one go when there was no other way out.On August 9 water levels were at 2397 ft and the Minister for Power said that the dam would be opened any time from now. But then the Minister for Water Resources said that no way would the dam get opened now. One shutter of the dam was finally opened when the water level was at 2399 ft.By August 13 situation at Idukki Dam had become so dangerous that 15 lakh cubic litres of water had to be released every second, in order to bring the water levels under control. By then water from Mullaiperiyar dam had also started entering the catchment area.All the shutters at Sabari Giri dam was opened up with no notice at all. Due to this areas like Aranmula, Chengannur (Alappuzha Dt.) and Ranni (Pathanamthitta Dt.) was completely flooded and people taken by surprise.TN has control on two dams; Upper Sholayar & Parambikulam. They too opened up the shutters without informing KL who controls another dam downstream - Peringalkutthu. Due to which this dam too had to be opened all of a sudden, which led to the flooding in Chalakkudi and suburbs (in Thrissur Dt.). Banasura Sagar Dam in Wayanad (North Kerala) was also opened with no due notice. Even the district collector came to know about the dam opening AFTER the flooding had started. Philip wrote:However, the aid could be. considerably ramped up when compared with the billions in farm waivers, etc.We know the cost of front- line fighters too .The state could be given a long-term loan on easy repayment terms.Again from a Malayalam news paper, and yet again no English translation for this report as well. The report may also give a good picture on the financial position of the state (irrespective of the bravado of KL politicians and camaraderie of UAE etc., while the evil Indian Govt which is messing up things). 1. Kerala plans to levy an extra cess of 10% on the S.G.S.T component of GST. For this an approval has to come from the Central Govt. 2. State plans to take a loan of Rs 10,500 crores. Currently the amount which a state can take loans is pegged based on the State GDP. 3.5% of the State GDP can be taken as loan. Kerala wants this to be raised to 4.5% of her State GDP. For this to happen amendment has to be made on the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 which again has to be done by the central govt.3. Rs. 2600 crores of extra funding on the MGNREGA (the minimum rural employement act), so that the labour costs involved in building new homes, rebuilding infrastructure etc. can be taken up using the extra funds.So if you see the state by herself does not have much money to spare. The treasury is pretty much empty. Point #3 seems to be the easiest and logical thing to do, to get things moving. Point #2 again seems to be a strange demand to alter a perfectly working formula. Just because Kerala has a low state GDP, really does not require amendments to a central act. Other states can also then ask for amendments. Point #1 may also work, but again it would be the people in the state who will have to pay a cess.jpremnath wrote:And to those who think that the public is itching to revolt against the commies (regardless of how much i hate that wretched party), you should know that from ground zero, people are grateful to the state govt, the fishermen, the armed forces and the rest of the country for rushing to its help in such a calamitous event...In fact, its been a big PR disaster for the BJP even among the hindus...and how would i know?.because my folks and family are spread in Alappuzha and Chengannur, the worst hit areas.Yes, there is truth in what you said and the BJP fans may not be really happy. But; BJP was never in a good position in Kerala at all. And from the way BJP state level leadership (if they have leaders, by the way) behaves smart politicians like A.Shah and Na.Mo may have reprioritised their future plans. I don't think even BJP felt that some deft handling of this sad situation would give them clear majority in next Lok Sabha or state level elections. The state does not have BJP leaders of that calibre. The RSS etc. were active in Kerala, they were active during the floods so there is status quo.The Central Govt. (BJP) has actually played the game by the book. Kerala government was looking for an escape route (to lay blame) and a kind of blank cheque on the payments side. Nothing of that seems to be happening. First was the demand of giving every thing over to the Army. Army clearly said no, and asked the civil administration to do the front end part and they would be there to assist. If Kerala Govt. and people expected every single soldier/naval rating/air man to be there with his equipment in Kerala, that was wrong expectations. When Modi came to the state the hopes were again some huge amount to be released, with again no explanations asked. It was Modi who came with a better plan. Instead of just releasing funds, and hoping that KL government does the job; he promised that his own central agencies would come and fix things at their costs. The state can use funds in her hand for some thing else. Then came the grand plan of help from UAE sheikh and even possible help from UN. If these people were allowed to have a free run in the state, it would only have fuelled more dissent. That was also neatly cut out, when citing past precedence all such ""offers for help"" (with knife held at the back) was rejected. India can help KL state, and it is now upto that state to decide. If KL acts too uppity here, the BJP can very well play a counter game and say that the state is actually a freeloading state. Yes, I agree Central Govt. should have released a road map and said what exactly it would do upfront. But the Central Govt. may also have a reasonable expectation that the State Govt. machinery (or rather the political party) would also be responsible enough to work in a uniformity; keeping the country's aim at the highest point. But what happened was that this natural calamity was used to for political purposes. Unreasonbale expectations were allowed to flourish among the KL population, hoping that when they get dejected their anger can be turned against the BJP. So what ever the Central Govt. (or BJP) planned to do, they were all in for practical purpose ""operating in a very hostile territory"". They were never going to get due credits, and neither they were going to be given any respect (due to them or other wise)."

Courier Delivery is iffy (all delivery channels being used for the top priority emergency supplies), but I think it is smarter to order fast because they are going to run out of these at Amazon and FlipKart and face long delays in getting new supplies from cheen. I don't have experience with the Bosch one, but do have with the 1500W Karcher one. Pretty quiet. Got whole driveway and front steps and small porch done in about 4 hours at my speed, cutting through about 7 years of crud and moss etc as well as dirt. In that mode one uses the nozzle like a shaving razor, with a cut width of only about 50mm. For the mud removal I bet it will work with about 1-foot swath if done soon, and leave the surface looking new. So it should be possible to do one house in a couple of hours, and the powerful one may be OK to use for 8 hours a day. Using the detergent dispenser is a good idea for the toxic sludge, but is not absolutely essential: it cuts very clean. One can come in with a detergent/ disinfectant cloth later on, that may be more efficient. 120 atmospheres pressure is ***VERY*** dangerous. Use glasses. Also, don't try to wash hands/feet holding nozzle within 1 foot or you'll cut yourself. Don't let ""PinHead"" Pinnarayi types use it. Ppl are using bleach for cleaning. Be careful. (glasses?) Try to get a heavy-duty Outdoor power cord with 3-pin so you have some protection in wet areas. Gas-powered pressure washer can get things done much faster, but it is also very heavy and needs a truck I think. The electric ones, well, you need electricity, which is either the mains if they work, or a separate diesel generator. So diesel generator + electric I think is maybe smarter and more versatile (you can use the generator for lights) than trying to get a gas-powered washer. Those are best to rent; anyway I did not find any on Amazon.in. Renting an electric and bringing it on a rented truck from Chennai does not seem cost-effective. From what I hear, people are so angry and that energy is driving an extremely fast recovery. Shops back to normal operation."

The ""serves you right"", if I sounded that way was mainly after seeing the ""UAE sheikh is my dad for now, because he offered me Biriyani, my true Indian father could only give me rice"" kind of campaigns I saw in social media starting yesterday. As a person who now has spent more life out side the state, than inside KL; honestly I was irritated with the kind of social media posts of Keralites dissing pretty much every non-Keralite person for some or other reason (when many of these people themselves were out side the state working). Already the local media has started the post-mortem on how the dams were badly managed during the floods, so people are gonna know sooner or later how the govt was sleeping at the wheels (or quite inept). I don't have much hopes on even the ""official"" opposition of the state; INC to actually stand with the people and ask some tough questions from the government. CPI(M) still has every thing under a tight grip. They still have the capability to dodge from tough questions, and pass up things to the central government. Actually the ministry has a very tough job of planning for the next 2-3 years. They ideally cannot be hostile to the GoI and would have to learn the skill of negotiating (often at slightly unfavourable/not used to terms).Any ways, back to business...Opposition terms floods a man-made disaster, blames govt.Flaws in dam management blamed for flood havoc.Banks declare one-year moratorium on all loans in flood-hit regions."

The center has limitations in terms of past precedents and equal treatment of its citizens in every state.Sadly, the central team's evaluation of the damage and the states' evaluation of the damage very often differs by many orders of magnitude.The recent floods are not a unique occurrence in the country and neighbouring states are badly affected too. Some time ago, uttarakand was devasted very much more and it simply did not receive the same blanket TV coverage that has been focussed in this instance. It also received about a 1000Cr in central aid from the sonia-MMS govt in 2013.No central govt will ever enter into any discussion of finances during any ongoing crises. It will quickly deteriorate into a vicious tu tu, mai mai, benefiting none but the commies and the jehadi ropers and rolers.The moneys received from the center have not yet been fully spent by the state. Huge aid in cash and kind are continuing to pour in from all over.motivated and unreal expectations are being viciously fanned, primed and spread by urban naxals and ""intellectuals"" and the controlled media in kerala which everyone in kerala knows who controls and how it is controlled.One actual beneficiary of these floods are the pedophiliac padres and their ""protectors"" whose ongoing expose and TV coverage was completely drowned out by the rising waters and the shift of media attention.I rather think that the comarades are hoping to make a quick and completely unaccounted killing and gather huge funds for their 2019 foray, having already lost all their other ATM machine states.here is turdesai with his finely practised fire fanning techniques and our comrades indulging in their favourite politicking and center bashing.I am disappointed with the money offered by Govt of India: Kerala Fiannce Minister to @sardesairajdeep https://twitter.com/i/status/1031971405280174082https://bit.ly/2MJ4H1q"

If it fails, don't worry he will come back asking for more funds.And this whole drama of UAE Sheikh offering 700 crores of funds to Kerala, the more I think about it the more I am reminded of a Malayalam movie Pranchiyettan & the Saint. The way things are going it was some wheeling & dealing of a certain businessman which seems to have actually taken place. The scheme if worked would have made the businessman ""invaluable"" for the state (and becomes his next stepping stone, to deal at GoI levels), the UAE Sheikh (of a sheikdom, which is not a democracy) gets a chance to enhance his image, and the Kerala commies gets what they want the most; money. The C.M's relief funds, AFAIK is open for contributions from any one. Any body can contribute, and the source of funds are only asked for if the amount exceeds some limit (3 lakhs??). But the Sheikh contributing to this fund (with no fan fare), would not have fit into the overall plans.Mean while St.Antony has this to say - Rejecting aid may affect Kerala-UAE relations: AK Antony. Why so much adamancy in taking funds from UAE? How is it that if the funds are not accepted it would effect bilateral relationships? Is there a concern that the Sheikh or the businessman would ""lose his face""? The cries are getting louder - UAE is not any other nation: Chief Minister.. Seems to be becoming a more concentrated efforts. The ""secular, liberal, progressive"" folks may join in soon.

I know DGCA does such enquiries when ""incidents"" involving air planes occur (even for smaller issues). Set up an enquiry commission to bring out the truth about the whole sad incident. Table it in the Lok Sabha, and the BJP MPs can be ready with their questions. The Lok Sabha MPs from KL are mostly from the ruling party of the state, CPI(M). Ask some well pointed questions, and Lok Sabha TV any way can cover this Live. BJP should get points which it can take to its voters.

What is being said now is that the country has provisions to accept aid if it is voluntarily offered. A circular issued by Na.Mo Govt in 2016 is taken as a reason to allow such aids read with provisions in Chapter 9 of the NDM policy.Provision 9.2 of the said plan reads as follows:-9.2 Accepting Foreign AssistanceAs a matter of policy, the Government of India does not issue any appeal for foreign assistance in the wake of a disaster. However, if the national government of another country voluntarily offers assistance as a goodwill gesture in solidarity with the disaster victims, the Central Government may accept the offer. The Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India is required to coordinate with the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, which is primarily responsible for reviewing foreign offers of assistance and channelizing the same. In consultation with the concerned State Government, the MHA will assess the response requirements that the foreign teams can provide. The NDMP is a plan/policy document; it only gives the basic guide lines. It is actually NOT a law. And there is a wide discretionary power for the Central Govt. And note that MHA can assess what the recipient country has to offer to help in the relief. The UAE government has no man power to offer, nor any technical expertise to offer.

This whole idea seems to have come from a ""businessman"" (not a capitalist like Ambani, Adani). It seems he got the UAE sheikh to donate some amount. Even the Kerala CM came to know of this AFTER this. The kerala CM tried to get the money, and that is when GoI threw the rule books at them. Looks like the Kerala CM was not aware of this and the businessman thought that every one would just kow tow when he brings the UAE sheikh. The official posts etc may have come if the behind the scene actions turned positive. Now actions from all parties are exposed, so a change from current stance becomes more difficult. The sheikh can donate to CM'S relief fund, but that would make it auditable. Where as charity amounts to the government rarely gets audited. Anyway, one thing it did effectively was divert the attention away from dam water mismanagement and unscientific release of water without any warning.True. It is for the BJP to use it's cards well and time and again ask GoKL to give a good report on how the dams got opened up.

habal,23 Aug 2018 23:45,"I think people this time around were truly scared of this iteration of floods. A lot of people instead of leaving for relief camps decided to stay put in the first floors of their homes. Reasons may vary from presence of old parents or domestic animals or fear of looting. And it was not for a day or two but for weeks together. When it rains heavily in kerala during south west monsoon, water level rises gradually and dips really fast as soon as rains get over. The rain water just pooled here and there harmlessly and went away as soon as it came. This time around it was very different, as there was/is tremendous flow to the water and at first it seemed to be dam water creating strong currents in flood but dam water ebbing has not stopped these strong currents in certain areas which are still under water. Secondly many rivers in Kerala channel water to sea through certain backwater lakes. These lakes can absorb tremendous quantities of water and throw them out to sea. This time around these lakes got swollen for some reason and started exerting reverse pressure on the river. So much so that in some places, rivers which normally drain out to sea from east to west got choked up and started expanding southwards instead. Also the water this time around is still staying put in many places in aleppey, kumarakom etc even after 5 days of straight sunlight. A phenomenon hitherto unheard and unseen by the state peoples. Usually a bit of sunlight is enough to send any pool of water scurrying towards seas or lakes and tinier quantities get evaporated. Not so this time."

The talk about 1924 100-year flood is just to say that ppl built homes in 100-year-flood plain, and it was all due to distributed rainfall: that is really not the problem (OK, jury is still out until Dileep's Ultimate Simulation delivers the verdict).

As we all know kerala is a bankrupt state. Only way they can make some money is through water/electricity trade and activities surrounding it. Now each foot of dam water means millions of units of electricity to trade on national grid to fund a cash starved state exchequer. So they have tendency to store water because for last 2 decades or so the state has rarely received surplus rainfall esp in dam catchment areas so tendency is towards maximising storage, you can say dam management was partly complacent and partly victim of higher storage temptations."
ramana,24 Aug 2018 0:15,"habal, Stagnant water leads to malaria from mosquitoes breeding.It also implies the normal drainage channels are clogged or insufficient. Some one had posted the rainfall amount it was 1.5 times the normal rainfall. The dams were close to 90% full when the extra water was dumped. There was no regular release f waters to ensure safe margin in the dams. Historical records show Kerala handled higher than this amount of rainfall in earlier decades going back to 1920s.The flood situation was aggravated by the water stored in dams being released suddenly, simultaneously without due warning as set in the procedures. Local district administration Collector and SP were not informed. Some reports say WhatsApp was used to spread the information that the waters are being released. Is this standard communications to use?There is a need to find out how the waters got released like that as it multiplied the disaster. And this was not even a black swan which implies 9 to 10 standard deviations.So need some inquiry to find out what policy changes are need to prevent future occurrence for it will repeat as its only 1.5 times normal rainfall.The good thing is the death toll is under 350 and not like earlier events.I have done many root cause analysis and find that when policies and procedures are followed rigidly without any chance for human decision making, when those who form the rules are far away from the problem (Politicians and Supreme Court), when there is divided responsibility like TN runs the dam in Kerala, when penalty for independent action is severe, this type of accidents are normal."

Did Japan ask for aid during the fukushima disaster or for 2011 Tohuku earthquake where 15000 people died? It was one of the costliest natural disaster in history. Also this calamity was man made.

SaiK,24 Aug 2018 2:46,"data points so far:- In mid-July, all dams were 90 per cent full. - For the first time in Kerala during the south-west monsoon, all the 40-odd rivers were in spate. Reservoirs were filled to the brim and shutters of 80 dams were opened to release water.- In one of the worst floods witnessed in the last century in Kerala, 231 lives were lost and nearly 14.50 lakh people are still in about 3,879 relief campsafter a murderous monsoon rampaged through the state in its second spell that began on August 8.- more than half of Kerala’s dams (57%) are hydroelectric projects operated by the Kerala State Electricity Board. The rest are operated by the irrigation department. For both entities, the amount of water stored is motivated by demand for electricity and irrigation, rather than flood-control measures.- Unchecked quarrying and construction in ecologically weaker areas contributed to the damage - Madhav Gadgil- Chennithala attacked officials of the Kerala State Electricity Board for trying to reap maximum profit by generating more power, even as the situation was getting out of hand. In mid-July, all dams were 90% full. KSEB and the government ignored the warnings - M Gadgil.- The Aliyar dam in Upper Sholayar was opened by Tamil Nadu without warning, thus flooding many parts of Thrissur and Chalakudy, while there are charges that no red alert was sounded before the dams of the Sabarigiri scheme were opened, resulting in severe flooding.- https://www.livemint.com/Politics/VwQrM ... erala.htmlhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cit ... 501677.cms====Commie theory:====“Between 1st and 19th of August, Kerala received 788.6mm rains compared to the average 287.5mm.

UlanBatori,24 Aug 2018 6:09,"While there was very heavy rain in some hill areas (Wynad), the story of monster rains all over, may not hold water. Overall the rain was only some 20% or so above normal, and that abnormality came early too, so that, yes, reservoirs were nearly full by end of July. If heavy rains were then predicted (and predictions were there), the lazy oafs should have started releasing water fast. They did not. The daily rain / hourly rain is not a meaningful metric. We can check whether the flooding in cities was due to just heavy local rain, or how much was due to idiots opening dams. I don't know the answer for sure, but I know to 90% certainty that it was **NOT** local rain that did it. Heavy rain came in June, and it was after the ground had already been well-soaked. So Trissur for instance may have seen 1-foot floods due to the heavy downpour of August, but there is no explanation for fast-flowing, relatively clean top-level water rising in 4 hours from 1 foot to 5 feet, which is what did all the damage. But let's see... A few voices are beginning to take up the question, and as others find time and electricity and transport, they are also going to start asking. As for Sholayar flooding Trissur, others are blaming Peechi which is the local reservoir, a LOT closer than Sholayar etc. My bet knowing how the Top-Down Decision system works in Malloostan is that the CM and his goons were ""out to lunch"" and ignored all calls for decisions for the past 2 weeks.

Dileep,24 Aug 2018 6:59,"UB Sir, it was not the LOCAL RAINS. It was the RAINS in the HILLS. I didn't save the data, but there was unprecedented rain in the hills, which is STILL DRAINING at 200 Cumecs from Idukki, after one whole week after rains stopped.Last week this time, Idukki was draining (officially) 2000 Cumecs, and the dam level was RAISING.Muvattupuzha and Meenachil don't have much dams. They too flooded precisely the same time.So, using 20/20 hindsight, you could say that the damn dam operators should have drained Idukki by 30 feet by 14th Aug (and other dams similarly), and received all the water.Of course, if the rains had not come, we would have had power cut (ohwait! now that the north-south grid is up, we could get power from Bihar etc, so no power cut).IMD had predicted rain, but Kanipayyoor had predicted no rain. In my experience, the latter used to be more accurate.Seriously... IMD's warnings have gone damp squib multiple times. Accuweather gives better prediction here, as I observe.To summarize:1. The root cause of the floods is the heavy rain in the HILLS. The only solution for the Periyar basin was to drain the dams in anticipation of the rains, which is not logical to expect from the system. Muvattupuzha, Meenachil, 3ShivName etc would have flooded nevertheless.2. Dams opening in the night was the fault of the operating manual (which was written at an era when instant communication was NOT available to the dam site.)3. If they had waited till morning, the flood would have been the same. Would a dam have collapsed? Maybe not. they are not built with that poor a margin. But given it is Kerala, and looking at all the Public Works, maybe they ARE. Who knows!!So, what do I propose?1. The ""Great Simulator"" 2. Revise the operating manual of dams to include lines like ""Add two feet to the trigger value if it is night"", ""Call collector and inform. Keep a recording of the call as evidence"" etc.. etc...3. Kick out evil TN babus from managing the dams in KL.4. Personally: Maybe buy a place at and move to Nilampathinjamukal and have a cellar with doomsday prep for a month."
UlanBatori,24 Aug 2018 8:03,"Thx. Let's see if we can capture that in sim. Is it possible to get records of the rain in the hills (not from CPIM HQ or PeeDubyaDee Dept. of CoverUp)? True that the inflow to dams may have looked very scary if it was that abnormal. They need some simulation nevertheless to spread the release over several hours, starting earlier - doesn't that come from a bit of experience anyway? Rain sensors in the hills maybe? Isn't it logical that if A, B, C and D up in the hills (watershed for Dam F) all are getting socked with heavy rain, there is going to be fast-rising water in rejerboir F which is already at 90 percent, say 2 hrs later? Get a head start and release when these reports come (safe to expect that dam wont be empty next morning?) Even a WhatsApp group that calls in from A, B, C and D saying: ""Allo!!!! Raining cats, dogs and pakistanis here for past 30 mins!"" should be enough, hain? IMO with 100 years experience, this level of foresight is not unreasonable to expect of dam operators. You or I may not have the experience, but we are not paid to be dam operators. They are supposed to have the basic ability to look out over the reservoir, see the level, and use the ""leettil gray cells"" to reason that heavy rain in the hills under these circumstances means dam will overflow by morning. So any reasonable dam operator must have it drilled into them that if the level is high by July, one has to be watchful, look at the hills, and start releasing at very short notice. If they didn't do that, it is still criminal negligence. The excuse given, is like an incompetent hospital giving excuses on why a patient died and covering up basic failure to give help in time. OK, she bled to death. How were WE to know that losing this much blood would lead to death? We started transfusion as SOON as her heart stopped beating and the cardiogram trace became flat! The idea is to do the draining through the rivers, rather than through ppl's homes, as far as possible. An experienced dam operator must have some idea of what level of opening will do what to the ppl downstream. Even then I do have my problems believing that this was all that happened, that it was not due to loooong delays in Chain Of Command (which no baboon will admit, given the nature of the guvrmand). Was looking at reports of Cat 4 hurricane approaching Hawaii. They have got some 28 inches of rain inside a day or 2 and sea state is not encouraging so beaches are also flooded to maybe 1 foot, not much more. I don't think they have dams to open, though, so not sure what I can learn."

Government, have no institutional memory, other than what is codified in the manuals.So, the only solution is to update the manuals.I hope the simulation can tell exactly how much Cumecs can be released from each dam, so that the waterfront properties get a nice coat of natural terracotta paint, but things beyond are left alone. And more importantly, it gets into the manuals."

Javee,24 Aug 2018 11:24,"The KSEB is accused of failing to maintain safe levels in its reservoirs by releasing water at the right time by properly analysing and understanding weather forecasts so that it could have avoided the situation of opening the shutters of all major dams – 37 of them – at the same time after all of them were filled to or beyond capacity, which enhanced the magnitude of the disaster.The board is also charged with failing to issue proper notice and alerts to the people well advance while opening the dams as a result of which they did not get time to move to safety leading to the loss of several lives. This had also led to heavy loss of livestock, essential items, household implements, important documents and certificates.Several panchayats in Wayanad district, Aluva, Paravur, Kaladi and many other regions in Ernakulam, Ranni, Kozhenchery and Pamba in Pathanamthitta, Chengannur and Kuttanad in Alappuzha and all the villages and towns on the banks and the basin of the Chalakkudy river in Thrissur district were hit by floods triggered by the water released from major dams.It is said that the KSEB had opened the big dams like Cheruthoni in the giant three-dam Idukki hydel reservoir system, Idamalayar dam, the eight dams of the Sabarigiri hydel project in Pathanamthitta district, Sholayar and Peringalkuthu dams in Thrissur district and the Banasurasagar in Wayanad district without taking precautions or informing the people.The Wayanad District Collector, chairman of the district Disaster Management Authority, had complained that he was not informed of the opening of the Banasurasagar dam. Even a CPI(M) MLA, Raju Abraham of Ranni, complained, “I had asked them to open the Sabarigiri project’s dams only after issuing proper warning. They did not take it seriously.”The biggest alleged callousness of the KSEB and Dam Safety Authority was seen in the case of the Idukki dam with a maximum storage level of 2,403 feet. When the level touched 2,396 feet as back as on July 31, the plan was to open the shutters at 2,398 feet. But the board delayed the process till August 9 by which time things had allegedly got out of control.When newsmen asked Power Minister MM Mani, a native of Idukki, about the situation on July 9, minutes before opening the Idukki shutters for what the KSEB said was a trial run, his response was, “Should the dam be opened just for giving you stuff for news? If we release water, you would criticize us for not keeping water for producing power in the summer.”Demanding a judicial inquiry into the whole issue, Ramesh Chennithala said, “The KSEB should have known about the situation. The Power Minister is responsible. The Chief Minister should have known about it. Those responsible for this man-made disaster should be identified and prosecuted,” he said.While State Chief Secretary Tom Jose admitted that there was a communication gap in relation to the opening of the Banasurasagar dam, KSEB chairman NS Pillai rejected the charges. In what is being seen as an affront at the flood victims, he said, “If we had the capacity to predict floods, we would have saved all the people.”Claiming that there had not been any lapse in abiding to the Water Management Protocol, he said, “Proper warnings and the three-stage alerts were issued before opening the dams. I have with me the records proving that the dams were not opened in one go but it was done stage by stage and that we had completed all the required preparations before opening the dams”https://www.dailypioneer.com/nation/ker ... aster.html"
Javee,24 Aug 2018 11:48,"For folks complaining that TN opened the dams in Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP), the truth is that it is governed by Joint Water Regulatory Development Board (JWRDB) which has representatives from both TN and KL. Most of the dams in this system was full or near full for the last 2 months.This JWRDB is responsible for setting up operational procedures of the dam which will be executed by the Revenue officials (For TN controlled dams) and the Collector (KL side). KL has always demanded the dams in PAP system to be maintained at FRL so that they could use the water during summer. There has been protracted accusations between both sides but not an acrimonious fight. https://india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/ ... ct_JI02563Sholyar and Aliyar dam storage was close to FRL in Jul 3 and July 18 respectively. The whole system is jointly monitored by the JWRDB.After three years, the Sholayar Dam in Pollachi reached its full level around 3 a.m. on Sunday July 2, thanks to active south-west monsoon in Kerala, an official attached to Water Resources Organisation of the Public Works Department said.The overflowing Sholayar reservoir in the PAP and copious inflows into the Aliyar will bring cheer to farmers who rely on the projects to irrigate more than four lakh acres. The storage and the inflow may first benefit the farmers irrigating one lakh acres in the fourth zone who are due to get the water soon.According to officials, the surplus water has started flowing though the saddle sluice to the Parambikulam reservoir. The inflow into Sholayar on Sunday was 1,811 cusecs and the discharge was maintained at 1,044 cusecs.https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/t ... 307495.eceAliyar Dam, part of the Parambikulam Azhiyar Project in Pollachi, was inching closer to the full reservoir level with a storage of 118 feet as against its FRL of 120 feet on Saturday midnight July 19, resulting in releasing surplus water to Kerala, sources here said.The dam filled up after nearly two years, thanks to the bountiful South-West Monsoon and resultant copious inflow into the catchment areas in western ghats since last month.The water level that stood at 65 ft in June, rose to 116 feet on Saturday and further increased to 118 feet around midnight. Immediately after the water level touched 116 feet, Revenue Department has issued warning to those living on the banks of Azhiyar river.https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Co ... 489778.ecehttps://english.manoramaonline.com/news ... erala.htmlKL gave the following operational plan to the other dams in the region, Sudheer Padikkal, deputy director of the Joint Water Regulatory Development Board (JWRDB), who represents Kerala in the inter-state river sharing talks with Tamil Nadu, spoke to New Indian Express: “As per the operation plan, Kerala had asked Tamil Nadu to maintain the water level in the Parambikulam dam at 1,824.5 feet and in the Tamil Nadu Sholayar dam at 3,293.3 feet to ensure a controlled release of water into the Kerala Sholayar and Poringalkuthu reservoirs located downstream, which were already full. The Full Reservoir Level of the Parambikulam dam was 1,825 feet. As the inflow to Parambikulam and Tamil Nadu Sholayar dams increased, the water was released into the Poringalkuthu reservoir and on to the Chalakudy river.”Subsequently, he said, 35,000 cusecs of water was released from the Parambikulam dam and 30,000 cusecs from the TN Sholayar dam which flowed into the Chalakudy river. http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/ ... 58821.html"

There is even a petition on the SC asking for CISF protection for the dam. There are so many instances where party workers loiter in the dam area, harassing engineers. Also, security to the dam is given by Kerala Police, TN just have PWD officials there. Without mincing words, it accused the Kerala government of harassment by denying Tamil Nadu officials free entry to carry out routine periodical maintenance and repairs of the dam.It said the Kerala police remainéd silent spectators as Tamil Nadu’s “exclusive peaceful and uninterrupted possession is being seriously and unlawfully affected”.The application wants the Supreme Court to direct Kerala government to allow free access to Tamil Nadu officials to the dam and its appurtenant structures to collect data and change the weekly chart in the Mullakodi rainfall station.It said the court should direct Kerala to allow Tamil Nadu to transport the machinery and materials required for carrying out repairs.https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ ... 096804.ece"

Javee,24 Aug 2018 17:26,"Dileep chetta, Here is more data from the TN affidavit that was filed in response to the KL affidavit,https://barandbench.com/wp-content/uplo ... eriyar.pdfI'm just posting excerpts, rest in the above link,I state that the water level in the Idukki Dam on 14.08.2018 was 731.08 m (2399 ft.) against the FRL 732.43 m (2403 ft.) and the quantity spilled was 46.26 Mm3 (1.634 TMC). But on 15.08.2018 the level was 731.868 m (2401 ft.) and the quantity spilled was 390.51 Mm3 (13.791 TMC), which is evident from data available in the website of KSEB. Thus it can be seen that State of Kerala suddenly increased the releases from 46.26 Mm3 on 14.08.2018 to 390.51 Mm3 on 15.08.2018. Similarly, the release of water from Idamalaiyar dam, which flows into the lower part of Periyar river was 117.72 Mm3 on 16.08.2018 while the release from the dam was Nil on 14.08.2018 and 15.08.2018, and thus, the release was sudden.The storage level in the Mullai Periyar Dam as on 01.06.2018 was 115.70 ft. and on 14.08.2018 at 8.00 A.M was only 136.1 ft. against the permitted storage level of 142 ft. The inflow was only 4419 cusecs with a diversion of 2200 cusecs through the tunnel to Tamil Nadu. On 15.08.2018, when the water level reached 140 ft., spilling of water to downstream of the dam commenced and the initial release was 4489 cusecs. This was gradually stepped up in the course of the day to 8905 cusecs and the average spilling was 14429 cusecs. On 15th morning the level rose to 140.7 ft. and the inflow was 16629 cusecs and the quantity spilled to Idukki Dam was only 14429 cusecs (1.247 TMC), whereas the outflow from Idukki Dam on the same day was 390.51 Mm3 or 13.79 TMC. On 16.8.2018, inflow into Mullai Periyar Dam was 25,730 cusecs and the quantity spilled to Idukki Dam was 23,397 cusecs i.e., 2.022 TMC and the outflow from Idukki Dam was 126.63 Mm3 (4.472 TMC). Similarly on 17th, 18th & 19th, Idukki Dam surplused 114.84 Mm3, 70.52 Mm3 & 59.4 Mm3 respectively. Thus, the total quantity spilled from Idukki Dam from 14th to 19th August 2018 is 808.16 Mm3 (28.54 TMC), and from Idamalaiyar dam in the corresponding period is 219 Mm3 (7.74 TMC) totaling to 1027.16 Mm3 (36.28 TMC), whereas the quantity released from Mullai Periyar Dam to Idukki Dam during the corresponding period is far less than the quantity surplused from Idukki and Idamalaiyar dams. Thus, it is seen that that flood surplus from the Idukki dam is mainly due to the flows generated from its own independent catchment due to unprecedented heavy rainfall while the contribution from Mullai Periyar Dam was significantly less. ..Keeping in view the rains in the catchment area of Mullai Periyar Dam, the flood warning for every raise of water level of 1 ft. was issued to the concerned officials in the State of Kerala. When the water level in the Mullai Periyar Dam reached 140 ft., water was allowed to spill through the spillway of the Dam after giving sufficient flood warning and was made in the presence of the Engineers of Kerala...The State of Tamil Nadu duly informed the counterpart of Kerala since the water level in the Dam reached +136 ft. Thereafter,when the water level reached +138 ft., +140 ft., +141 ft. & +142 ft., suitable warnings were issued and the quantum of discharge were also intimated..Infact, the dam gates were opened when the reservoir level was at +140 ft. and thereafter the discharge was stepped in stages after giving sufficient warnings, in order to avoid flash floods. The initial surplus quantity at +140 ft. was 4489 cusecs and thereafter stepped upto 8905 cusecs, when the water level was 141 ft. and the spillway was regulated further considering the rate of inflows to avoid flash flows. In any event the quantity spilled from Mullai Periyar Dam is very small when compared to the quantity spilled by the 39 dams of Kerala. The flood warnings issued by officials of Tamil Nadu to officials of Kerala is annexed."
Dileep,24 Aug 2018 21:35,"^^Nice!! What a play of units!!>>the initial release was 4489 cusecs.

Initial was 4489, final was 8905and average was 14429.>>On 15th morning the level rose to 140.7 ft. and the inflow was 16629 cusecs and the quantity spilled to Idukki Dam was only 14429 cusecs 14429 Cusecs = 408 Cumecs. (For scale, remember that the mini flood in periyar on 10th was due to 500 Cumecs). At the time, Iukki was discharging 1500Cumecs. So, practically one-third of the water was from MP.>>outflow from Idukki Dam on the same day was 390.51 Mm3I don't know from where this figure was pulled out! Assuming this is for 24 hours, this will correspond to 4520 Cumecs flow. What a effing deception is this?>>On 16.8.2018, inflow into Mullai Periyar Dam was 25,730 cusecs and the quantity spilled to Idukki Dam was 23,397 cusecsOMG!! That comes to 662 Cumecs!!! Now the killer>>The total quantity spilled from Idukki Dam from 14th to 19th August 2018 is 808.16 Mm3 So, you average the Idukki flow over the long period, and ignore the peak impulse of 662 Cumecs from MP. That is the basic cause for the flood. What TN did is to mass discharge the water and then reduce the flow. Idukki actually spread the impact, but even that was insufficient to control the flood. I wish the KL experts note this play and raise this in the SC, but that is too much to ask from them.I should give it to the TN for this play of numbers.I do not trust anything that TN says. I have seen enough lies and deceptions already. Let me add this also to the pile!"
UlanBatori,24 Aug 2018 21:52,"Dileep, u r against full-time, 100-year experts. Your error is trying to excuse them saying they have no experience, when it comes to looking at the black clouds against the mountains and failing to consider that water level is going to rise at the dam and everywhere else in 2 hrs. They **ARE*** super-experienced when it comes to ""not-lying"". They give out a bunch of ""figures"" with units messed up. When someone says total flow was 230 cusecs, what does it mean? cusec is (per Wikipedia) Cubic Feet PER SECOND, so without saying ""X cusecs for y seconds"" there is no meaning to their statement. One can assume that it was until the next event, which may be 8 hours, or it may be 15 seconds. Deliberate clouding of facts. When that gets distorted through the super-diligent paragons of factual accuracy in the Indian Media, the result is complete gibberish. *I started at only 3CUSECS and ended at only 3.6 CUSECS, and the average was 67CUSECS*. THAT maybe totally accurate: what they don't tell you is that in between, they released at the rate of 1343CUSECS for 10 minutes, which deluged everywhere. Note that water is generally supposed to flow along rivers and other channels cut for the purpose. When the level exceeds the depth of the channel, the water flows outside the channel, and that is what is a ""flood"". The flood then finds its way into low-lying areas which are not so connected to the river. Once the flood waters get into your home, they don't just pour away because the river has gone down: they have no outlet. Look at the ISRO(?) contour map tool that allows you to look at various levels and see the areas that would be flooded. Go to zero (sea-level). You will see that many areas even around Dera3shivNaam will flood. So if you allow a HUGE pulse of flow to come down the river from the high-altitude dam, you make damn sure that huge flooding occurs. Hang them all, hang them high."
uskumar,24 Aug 2018 21:57,Let court decide whether TN is correct or not. No point in passing judgement before that.
ramana,24 Aug 2018 22:18,"Root cause is that cause by correcting will prevent the incident. All others are factors. Incident becomes a disaster when there is close coupling and overwhelms the system exponentially. By this understanding the excess rainfall was a trigger not a root cause.Root cause was the sudden release of waters which overwhelmed the system of dams and reservoirs.The system of dams and reservoirs were at 95 % storage as the human operators had not managed the water levels for flood control. The emphasis was on water storage for power generation and irrigation. Why was This? From a long time excess rainfall did not cause such devastation as the run off was drained to the sea. And constant political bickering between Kerala and TN with presstitute media blowing up the differences.Charles Perrow in his book Normal Accidents says three factors are at play in such cases:- Closely coupled system where a small change far downstream migrates to the front of the system where the accident is apparent. Kerala dam and reservoir system is quite close coupled system - Long period of normal system behaviour. Past rains caused manageable floods.- This long period of normal.syayem behaviour brings human factors into play. Especially complacency.Add one more factor here. TN had control of water reservoir and dam in Kerala. They displayed total lack of accountability to Kerala where the dam was located. I submit a three member inquiry should be ordered. One member from TN, Kerala, and Assam. Last one from far away staye which has familiarity with floods, hills, forest cover.I think forum should contribute without emotion and hyperventilating."
UlanBatori,24 Aug 2018 22:55,"One other aspect is that they may have thought in good faith (I mean the dam operators, not the commies) thay they were trying to ***prevent*** a flood, when they should have been tasked with **MINIMIZING** the inevitable flood. The former is done by contributing NOTHING (""JUST SAY NO!"" to requests to open a little) until ""TINAO"" where they HAD to open in panic. So for this they will blame poor forecasting, but looking at the rain in the hills should have been enough warning for them; it would have allowed 1 to hours of strong flow (yes, with some flooding) and eliminated the need for a shock opening. Root cause: Poor Dam Mangement at top of Chain of Command. (i.e., Hang them!) But listen: there is a 100-year history of this. I used to hear of stories on how someone was crossing the BharataPpuzha peacefully circa June, rocking casually in a bullock cart across the ""manappuram"" (sand beach) which was the whole river bed, and chewing their betel leaf pan. As they got to the middle, there was a rumble as of approaching thunder; a strong breeze blew, and whammo!! A 10-foot WALL OF WATER slammed them and carried bullocks, cart and riders swiftly downstream in the torrent. I was told that this was the Effect Of Rain In the Mountains, but now I am pretty sure this is what happens due to a sudden and careless dam opening. No warning sireens in those dins, this is from waaay back. Dams were not even in ppl's consciousness: they attributed this to ""Fate"", not ""Callous Idiocy Of Pompous Asses"".

Dileep,25 Aug 2018 6:45,"Ramana, that was an excellent take!!Here are some more lies, dam lies and statistics by Tamilistan:1. KL doesn't share rain information: You know where this stems from? TN always try to put a toetip in the geography to define at least a square mm of catchment area of MP within TN, to claim that Periyar is an ""interstate river onlee"". Even here at BRF, during the last ""MP War"", this claim was made, and I had dug up a lot of information to debunk it. TN Forest dept or revenue dept tried to put border marker stones on KL side for this purpose. When the KL forest staff (the ones not in the payroll of TN) found this and objected, they claimed that these are not marker stones, but foundation for rain gauges. They were promptly kicked out and the markers uprooted. The result: Periyar is still a non-interstate river, but TN kept on saying ""no rain information onlee"". I am not sure if there are rain gauges in the jungle. I am not sure if they are needed either.2. KL Police and Party thugs harass TN officials: Party Thugs :rofl: Poor guys think the party cadres here are like the MK parties of TN, where they draw blood upon hearing about MP (like beating up the poor bakery owners and KL registered vehicles when there is a protest in KL about MP). They have better things to do, like collecting 'nokku kooli'. They will not move their ass unless there is some immediate benefit, and MP is not something they care.Police and other officials: Yes, they object when TN act smart and does some mischief, like driving jeeps on the dam, or dumping dirt on the spillway to increase the level with plausible deniability. KL Blocks Maintenance and Repairs: That is even funnier. TN tried to put some concrete and mortar in the gaps just before there was some inspection. This was not an officially sanctioned repair, and promptly objected by the KL side. This happened at the time this high power committee was in place."

India-born US scientist will develop a prototype forecasting modelNew Delhi, August 24The Centre has finally decided to develop dynamic flood forecasting models for the major river basins in the country, M Rajeevan, Secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, has said.“We have decided to engage Balaji Rajagopalan, a hydrologist with the University of Colorado in the US, to develop a prototype flood forecasting model for the Indian rivers. This will be funded through the ongoing National Monsoon Mission,” Rajeevan told BusinessLine.has been part of the team that was involved in developing a world-class model for managing the Colorado river basin in the US.According to him, the original idea was to develop a flood forecasting system for the Narmada river, which has now been extended to include many Indian rivers, including the peninsular rivers.“We are close to sending in our revised proposal following comments from the reviews.This will then be reviewed by Indian experts before a final recommendation is made. We are hoping it will be in the affirmative,” he said.The India Meteorological Department already has flood warning centres for many major rivers such as the Narmada, Tapto, Yamuna and the Ganga. But they focus mainly on forecasting floods in major urban areas on the banks of these rivers.The Central Water Commission too has flood warning (and forecasting) systems in place for many Indian rivers, but, according to experts, the efficiency of these forecasts leaves much to be desired.Meanwhile, CMDRF grows past 500crores"

Overall the rain was only some 20% or so above normal, and that abnormality came early too, so that, yes, reservoirs were nearly full by end of July. If heavy rains were then predicted (and predictions were there), the lazy oafs should have started releasing water fast. They did not. The daily rain / hourly rain is not a meaningful metric. We can check whether the flooding in cities was due to just heavy local rain, or how much was due to idiots opening dams. I don't know the answer for sure, but I know to 90% certainty that it was **NOT** local rain that did it. Heavy rain came in June, and it was after the ground had already been well-soaked. So Trissur for instance may have seen 1-foot floods due to the heavy downpour of August, but there is no explanation for fast-flowing, relatively clean top-level water rising in 4 hours from 1 foot to 5 feet, which is what did all the damage. But let's see... A few voices are beginning to take up the question, and as others find time and electricity and transport, they are also going to start asking. As for Sholayar flooding Trissur, others are blaming Peechi which is the local reservoir, a LOT closer than Sholayar etc. My bet knowing how the Top-Down Decision system works in Malloostan is that the CM and his goons were ""out to lunch"" and ignored all calls for decisions for the past 2 weeks. The Dam Mananagers of PeeDubyaDee and KayEssEeeBee stood around like Boy Standing On Burning Deck with their thumbs up their brains and their WhatsApp phones stuck between their ears. Then the Commies finally Convened at Marxist Party HQ after dinner and burped The Order at 9:50PM: OBEN SESAME! open all 80 dams full. Don't let dams break onlee! Drown the Bourgeouis Running Dogs of Capitalism!Reminds me of the book ""CONGO"" by Michael Crichton. A fine and gentle civilization builds a nice city. A bunch of vicious apes takes it over. Apologies to gorillas and chimpanzees: those are very gentle and intelligent creatures, no relation to Marxist Party hacks ruling Malloostan,Isnt it that dams can be opened only when water height are above the sluice gates? Since these dams have sluice gates at the top, how can they release water until it reaches the top? Does anyone know about the dam designs?I strongly believe that more dams are required to dam all water. For example there can be a mega dam at MP rather than a small one now. Same for Bhootatahan keetu. One of the issue is deforestation as in the case of proposed Athirapally dam. But if there was a mega dam in Athirapally, wont it have prevented the flood in Chalakudy river?"
Dileep,25 Aug 2018 22:17,"Idukki can start releasing water from 2374 ft. That is the minimum height of the sluice gate opening.A quick madrassa math shows that if Idukki was restricted to 500 Cumecs, the dam level would have risen 5 feet in a day. So, if the level was made 2388ft, the dam could have taken the excess and avoided the severe flood for the three day period.But that is using the 20/20 hindsight. How will you know how much rain you are going to get? The IMD may tell you a rough figure, but their reliability is not that good."
arvin,25 Aug 2018 23:08,">> One of the issue is deforestation as in the case of proposed Athirapally dam.

Building a mega dam might lessen the impact, but as seen in the case of Aluva which saw heavy flooding inspite of three dams MP, Idukki(mega) and cherutoni controlling waters to Aluvapuzha."
UlanBatori,25 Aug 2018 23:47,"May be better to have a system of several fairly deep lakes (think Lake Baikal) distributed at various points to act like capacitances. I don't know how to make those or whether they can add up to any significant storage. No walls to break. This is close to ""acquifer"" concept except with boating on top an expensive LakeSide Living around each. If u drown your body will never be found. Say 1000m deep. Use it to store compressed air for energy storage in bags at the bottom.Then again it may be cheaper to build canals maybe under or by the side of the National Highways or railroad right of way, to send the water to neighboring states such as TN.These will have significant flow only during extreme events such as floods in KL/ cyclone in TN. Overall, All*h has given Malloostan and TN an absolutely fantastic water exchange mechanism, in the form of the Western Ghats and the SW/NE Monsoons, separated by 3 months (a phase shift of 90 degrees!!). It is likeAllo Brats, here are these two gifts. See if you can squander them in a paki-brotherly fashion by ignoring the benefits and squabbling and biting each other's ass instead. The present situation is idiotic, given that it's been 70 years since it all became part of the same nation. Tamil Nadu is parched when KL is drenched. TN gets drowns as KL closes up dams in November/December, facing grim summer with power cuts and drying wells. Park a few trucks or rail engines at intervals to power the pumps needed to move the water. There is never any need to tolerate floods in either KL or TN, and probably never have a water shortage again. It ain't rocket science, as they say. Just disgusting political laziness. Hang them all."
Sridhar K,26 Aug 2018 5:36,"The Kings of Thondai Mandala aka greater Chennai and sorrounding districts had built a beautiful system of ponds ->smaller lakes>big lakes>rivers like Adyar and linked them to natural rivers like palar, kosathalaiyar to form a beautiful system of storing water from mansoons supply the paddy field all around the year. The rest of the water drained into marshlands and Buckingham canal,. Which is now converted to IT highway, where traffic crawls at 30 kms on toll road along with vehicles parked on the road along with cowsNow the entire system has been screwed with lakes converted to real estate, the interconnecting waterways with slums and apartment complexes, roads. During the rains leading to Chennai floods, the slums and thozhil adibars aka industrialist, educationalists who have build factories/colleges on lake beds and natural swarms/marshlands broke opened the lake walls on the opposite side to their real estate with dynamite so that yheir assets are protected. This resulted in flooding the suburban areas. The baboons open-end the sluice Gates of the big chembarambakkam lakes very late, waiting for permission from a brain dead Amma Govt. This resulted in in complete flooding of the Adyar river and Chennai. The point is lakes also have walls that gets breached by slums dwellers on the branches, sluice Gates not managed by baboons. Any good system can be messed up by corruption, greed, ineptitude and inefficiency"

The massive 'pandhal' called Ramamoorthy Mandapam has vanished, along with the 'nada panthal' ie the covered path from the bridges all the way to the Ganapathy temple. The two bridges that carried the people across the river are standing, but they end in water. the river flows to the east of them. The river flows close to the hill on the east, close to the steps leading to the Pamba Ganapathy temple. The road to Pamba is also severely damaged, so vehicles can't reach there.It would be impossible to recover before the pilgrim season set to begin in November. I am feeling bad about the possibility of missing my 'appointment'.Nothing is known about the trekking path from Pamba to the temple. It is likely that there are washouts on this path.

Sachin,26 Aug 2018 23:34,"Got back to head quarters after a not very eventful Onam. Some musings about the whole trip.1. I had entered Kerala via Wayanad Dt. at Bavali check post. The Nagarahole forest managed by the KA ends with a check post at the border. The forest area was really thick with green vegetation and water logging could be seen at places. Generally we do use to some sort of wild life, but this time did not even see a deer.2. Kaatikulam was the first town on the KL side. It was two days before the main day of Onam, and the town was pretty much with no fan-fare. Queues had formed in some shops (known as Maveli stores) which were managed by KL government. Mananthavady town also was not in its best. Wayanad district had seen some bad land slides, and some areas above (in the hills) Kaatikulam etc. had taken a severe hit. 3. Entered Kozhikode district via a ghat road at Kuttiyadi. This ghat road had taken a hit with multiple land slides and tree falls. But it was all cleared up, and the remenants of the trees were all pushed to the side of the road. The ghat road, surprisingly did not have much damage. There were some bad patches of road before the ghat road, they have gone from bad to worse. Roads in which a jeep could go have gone to a level where only tractors could go.4. Small towns like Perambra, and bigger ones like Vadakara (Dt. HQ) had very much active markets and shops. This area was relatively peaceful and people at least wanted to celebrate Onam at the confines of their home. SHQs parents had to move to their relative's home for a week since a small rivulet behind their home got flooded. But they did not lose much.5. Reached Thrissur dt. via Kozhikode-Valancheri-Edappal route. Roads were very much okay, except a few bad stretches which is usual after every rain fall. Nothing has turned out to be really bad here. Thrissur town did offer me some surprises. There were some areas in the town limits where fields were levelled out in 1980s to build houses. No floods there at all. Some how the water did manage to go some where else. There were areas which were converted into huge housing colonies in 1995 (and later) time periods. They seem to have taken a really bad hit. Water level rose upto at least 5 feet, and most common casualty have been cars parked in the garages. People in these housing colonies do not seem to have lost of much of their electronics items and documents etc. Thrissur town also seems to be not very keen on celeberating Onam this time. There were around 5-10 refugee camps operating in the district.6. The people who have taken the maximum hit, are from the lower income sections of the society. Most of them had built their homes in remote areas or areas very close the the fields/water bodies. Perhaps because this was the only areas available for them for the money they had. Many of these people worked as watch men in ATMs, or apartment complexes, maid servants etc; and they have lost the most . It is their rehabilitation which is going to be important (and also costlier). The northern part of the Thrissur district (which is now considered to be ""Thrissur city""), is now pretty much back to normal. Even a few folks I know; who are working in various critical GoKL agencies did find time to celeberate -at least partially- Onam with their families. 7. On the way to Palakkad (via Shornur) did see one place which had a massive land slide. The area unfortunately is now becoming an area for ""disaster tourism"". Right next to the state highway is a huge hill, and today we can clearly see the area from where the rocks & mud came toppling down. The land slide completely destroyed 4-5 houses in the area below the hill. It then pushed over to the state highway, where 3-4 people waiting at the bus stop also were covered up under rocks and mud. 8. The people who I met, none of them were really from the worst hit set of people. And most of them are generally ""politically neutral"" (unless they are in their own kind of crowd). Many did feel that GoKL agencies tried their best, once it was known that it is going to be a tough time. The role of the fishermen was highlighted by pretty much every one, followed by the Navy and Coast Guard teams; who were involved in the air lifting. IA and Kerala Fire & Rescue, perhaps were not duly recognized. Every one was in good appreciation of a few young IAS officers who actually did lots of good work, and also motivated every one to do their best. What did the IPS officers do, no one knew.9. Looks like relief camps in most of the northern districts have now got closed down, and folks have returned to their original homes. Alapuzha district seems to be the worst hit and around 500 odd relief camps are still operating there. Even with one relief camp having 100 families, the the total number of homeless would be close to 50,000.

Zynda wrote:I just want to mention if its not already being made aware, that certain FB posts are being posted where it makes it like it being drafted by RW Hindus. This flood has also exposed a big lot of bad things in Kerala. One of them is the strong presence of many people with strong seccesionist tendencies. Every one knew such people/groups existed, but that crowd has now exposed itself. The UAE Sheikh & his 700 crore farce actually brought out the splits in KL society. Many Islamic groups actually went overboard with their love for UAE and the Sheikhs and trying to show who was more servile to the Arabs. Many of the social media campaigns actually have originated in the Middle eastern countries, so we really don't know much legal remedies can be taken against them. The ""700 crore offer"", also brought out the greedy mentality of many people. Honestly, Rs. 700 crore is not really big money for India today. But a large part of Malayali society did go over board in trying to get that money from UAE, and even bad mouthing every other Indian. Now with Arnab Goswami hollering about this, a lot of Indians would have a slightly negative image of the KL crowd. There is a campaign planned to ""deal with Arnab"" (basically abuse him on social media), which again may cause more long term damage to Kerala than any one else.There were some ""dummy Hindutwa"" groups operating on Facebook. They, AFAIK was introduced mainly to deal with the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The real Sanghies have identified those groups, when they exposed themselves during the flood. Most of them have been reported, and Facebook has now taken them down.But what can be done against the Malayali abusive trollers (who target even very common Indian citizens) is perhaps all of the victims to use their own state police and the IT Act to get a formal case registered. Target the most vulnerable of the abusers; folks who are currently out of India. Lodge FIRs, and get the magistrate courts to get the cases going. Get ""look out"" notices issued, so that the moment these abusive crowd lands in any of India's airport, they get picked up. Most of these folks come home once in 2 years, with a leave for around 1-2 months. Even a 15 day time loss for them running after the court cases, and the threat of arrest and detention is enough for them to cry for mercy. Most of these abusive trollers are not very smart people.

Some devotees have offered to pay for rebuilding the bridges which can be used by the pilgrims. The Military Engineers have also said that they can rebuild the bridge. The minister in charge of temples had earlier said that ""soldiers can only stand with machine guns at check posts""; have grown wiser and have requested the Army to rebuild the bridge. With large scale destruction, people (and GoKL) seems to have kept aside Sabari Mala for some time. There is always some police presence at Sabari Mala and they have their wireless network still intact. At places like Kochu Pampa, looks like police & army men have already started some work to get Sabari Mala back to shape. There should be forest watchers, and other officials who can still trek through the forest and reach the temple. There is another alternate route to Sabari Mala (which many people use to come at the time of Makara Vilakku etc.) which is still intact. But Sabari Mala pilgrimage is not going to be easy, it would be the same as how this pilgrimage was undertaken 50-60 years ago.Singha wrote:Keralites are losing a fair share of goodwill in the states that routinely suffer floods To be quite frank; Keralites are again going to loose more good will if they continue the same style of behaviour which they show on social media.

Many of its users how ever do not seem to realise that social media has a wide reach; and it can even go beyond their original imaginary limits.

Many Islamic groups actually went overboard with their love for UAE and the Sheikhs and trying to show who was more servile to the Arabs. Many of the social media campaigns actually have originated in the Middle eastern countries, so we really don't know much legal remedies can be taken against them. Which brings up the thought that there is an amplification effect of bots. I think it would be naive to think that the US 2016 elections and the Brexit vote would be the only ones where bots were used to magnify polarization in the target polities. There is no reason that India would not be a target. The point is that the effect of a few hundred people can be greatly magnified by bots, to the extent that we would think there is a significant political opinion where in reality it is totally insignificant.Here is an article on how to spot bots on Twitter.https://medium.com/dfrlab/botspot-twelv ... dc7d9c110c"

Hmm. Bots and ficticious users can be used for magnification of an opinion. But when I see folks who I personally know; now just abusing every one else except the KL government I am getting a very sad feeling. A lot of KL citizens have been led to believe that they can just keep on making demands; and other states and Indian Union have to keep on providing the same. If this kind of behaviour gets more coverage; it is only going to cause anger and distrust in many Indians from other parts of India who will just say that KL is a bunch of freeloaders.Mean while on the status of the rescue & relief.Kuttanad, Chengannur under threat of epidemic.Kerala suffers loss of Rs 35,000 cr in flood havoc.

Dileep,27 Aug 2018 14:10,"The dam started discharging 500 cumecs on 9th, which is increased to 750 on 10th Aug.the level was brought down to 2397ft by this. Then the big rain came, mullaperiyar opened on the night of 14th, and all hell broke loose. Idukki was discharging 1500 Cumecs ever after.The area of Idukki lake is 60 sqkm at FRL. The level rose by 1.3 metres while the dam was discharging at 1500 Cumecs, and held there for two more days. If the discharge was a more safer 750 Cumecs, the level increase would have been 3.24 metres approximately, which is beyond safe limits. So, 'slow release' argument wouldn't work, if we activate it after the discharge started on Aug 9th.The IMD warning of more rain came AFTER the discharge of Aug 9th, so the demand that the level should have been reduced doesn't hold.To summarize: IMD warning for heavy rain happened after the dam is already discharging at the ""safe maximum"" of 750 Cumecs. So, nothing could have been done to reduce the level."

PLUS the backwaters will have tidal waves and rise say 10 feet by again, cyclode tidal swell (wind whips water shoreward on one side and sucks it out on the other). PLUS every port will be closed.

UlanBatori,27 Aug 2018 17:06,"And BTW, risking being blasphemous, I agree with Dileep's report on the superstitions about the cause (which caused lots of takleef and got one enraged entity to take a vacation). Nature got mad, very unsurprisingly, at the decades of trashing the pristine forests around Sabarimala. It has always been too dangerously blasphemous to report objectively on the annual trashing circus which has made a trip to any temple in KL an arduous process similar to the original pilgrimages[2] to SM. For instance DeraUstadMouth, starting about now and going through late December. Waited long enough for sense to prevail and control the annual mass trashing (and faaaar worse..) by raucous tourists with no basic potty-training let alone any other civilization. Now done a pretty thorough scouring and cleaning. Same can be said about Kedarnath, come to think of it. Hope someone sits down and thinks through that message instead of shooting the messenger(s) and trying to blame some subset that has **NOT YET** started participating in the annual trashing. At least, when reconstruction occurs, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan should impose some codes, and require adherence. OK, I will disappear for some time, pls don't ban me.[2] Original pilgrimages were indeed arduous. Had to walk on foot (barefoot of course) with a sack of all one's kit on one's head. 41 days because it took that long. High risk of becoming tiger-food. A far cry from the invasion army coming via Luxury AC Tourist Buses taking the ""holy"" crowd like a swarm of locusts through KL every Sep. - Dec. My suggestion would be to require a (pretty cheap but covering the maintenance costs) trekking permit from Dept. of Natural Resources to enter the forest area, and that permit is given for daily access to residents who live within a 10-mile perimeter, monthly access to those living within 100km, annually to any resident of KL, and once every 10 years to anyone else. Same conditions on access by vehicle. Stringent penalties for littering or otherwise insisting on ignoring Swacch Bharat. But surely I ain't posting this where ppl can trace my ID. Tigers are a minor worry."

Good if we do. Good if we do not trash the hills. Good if we do not encroach into forest land. Good if we leave alone poor lord Ayyappa. Good if we do our shopping in clth bags. But none of those is going to avoid a disaster if such a load of water gets dumped in the hills. Even if GoK babus get access to Lord Muruga as state astrologer and obtain 100% accurate weather prediction, allowing them to empty dams in advance and keep them ready, had the recent rains continued for four days instead of two, we would have seen the same or worse flood. A properly emptied Idukki can take only three days of this rain as my madrassa math shows.So, what is the point? We can do nothing if mother nature wants to go evil. Now, the notion that she decided to do so because we had been bad boys ranks in the same league as Lord Ayyappa got angry and decided to teach us a lesson.We could have avoided the worst in the Periyar basin if the warning came on 8th Aug or earlier, and the damned dam babus figured things out and emptied Idukki and Idamalayar. But what about the other river systems that flooded 3ShivName, StreetDrinking, 3StreamRiver, Milka, RedStoneLand etc?Gods wrath, nature's anger, global warming, sun cycle, you can imagine reasons, but this was a natural calamity with no assignable cause and no reasonable prevention."

Require all bldgs on land below Contour Red to have sealed compressed-air cylinders below them, purchased (of course) from Ulan Bator Hot Air&Renewable Energy Inc. And be built of Integral Monocoque Framework. And be on 4 sliding poles. And have max weight less than buoyancy. In flood time, the bldgs would simply slide up the posts, but float in place. (See Solomon Islands: they already do the poles/frame part for their beach homes because tsunami is expected any time, and they do survive tsunamis). Mudslides, well.. tough. Nothing is going to survive that. Seeing that Dera Eye mudslide video is Talk about Force of Nature. The mud was actually forming into huge waves!! Some protection of roads and rail-track side slopes may be wise. Plus some thought to better drainage from mountains. Drill holes, make a few streams if necessary. Sensors on slopes to warn traffic and close off roads and rail in time.But as for the other stuff, Dileepji, flood in parts of Dera 3shivnaam now unambiguously blamed on several canals etc. Directly downstream of certain dams that were opened. 6-inch flood may be Nature. 6-foot flood was anthropogenic stupidity or worse.

UlanBatori,28 Aug 2018 1:40,"My question is why the commies are underestimating the damage so much. 35000 crores is roughly 0.5 x 1000 crore dollars = 5000 million = 5 billion, hain? FIVE BILLION when practically 2/3 of a State goes under mud? you got to be kidding. They must mean only the govt./Party infra damage, not people's losses. There is no way to clean up and rebuild all losses (not counting the lives) for that kind of change. My estimate is at least $50B. KL construction costs are comparable to US. Just the number of Beamers and Lexuses and Mercedes swept away must run into a fair number of $M.

An average loss of $1000 each amounts to $1.2B. OK some ppl may not have had a lot, but many did. But look at those submerged towns: the loss is immense. What does it cost to feed 1.2 million for say 4 weeks until they can get back on their feet? (they may not eat a lot, but how many baboon are needed to organize the effort?) I think every plantain field is wiped out; most paddy fields may be washed away, large percentage of coconut trees may be ruined; mango trees ruined, vegetable crops ruined (pulses are grown on elaborate light-weight structures, all presumed washed away). Mattresses rendered unusable (filled with filthy water). Many houses have ruined/dangerous electrical wiring; meters flooded. airconditioners ruined. Refrigerators ruined. Expensive living room furniture, display cases, all ruined. TVs ruined (fortunately many are LED/LCD, may survive better than CRTs). Number of trees uprooted is immense. COK airport's solar farm may have suffered huge damage. Runways damaged. Rail tracks have huge gaps at most culverts. Floods washed away the soil and the stones under the tracks. Bridges gone. Road bridges down. Roads severely damaged.Wonder what happened to banks, clothing stores (entire inventory trashed?) bakeries, vegetable shops, meat shops in the towns which got submerged, such as chalakudy?"

First was the 2500 crore loan for celebrating a festival (Onam), and now she plans to take Rs. 3,000 crore loan from World Bank to rebuild herself. And this is even after trying all means (some of them being outright blackmail) to get more money from the central government.UlanBatori wrote:Rail tracks have huge gaps at most culverts.

But in Malloostan many such things are not reportable anywhere so may not be listed in insurance for fear of Tax Bibi.Insuring homes etc. is actually a very ""unknown"" concept in many parts of India, and Kerala. Remember even LIC's insurance policies were given to people mainly as a ""tax saver"", and not show cased for its actual purpose. I don't think even the big bunglaows made out of Gelf money have insurance. The poorer strata of the society would only have felt such things as unneccessary. Kerala's economy was mainly cash based. Now people of all hues & shades in Kerala would look up to one ""Insurance Company"" who they hope would give them what ever is required; that is Govt. of Kerala.Rs. 10,000 per family is what GoKL is now providing as immediate relief for people moving out of the relief camps. It is said that this is a ""temporary"" fund, so it is not clear if this is a one time settlement. Mean while the CM's relief fund has exceeded Rs. 700 crore, the amount which the UAE Sheikh was ""believed to have promised"" .Dileep wrote:Essentially, the govt will help you to get back on the feet (if you need help).

But I think there is also a widespread belief that some one else (either GoKL or GoI) would pump in truck loads of money, and every person affected would get all the funds to get back to the old way of life. And I am also expecting lots of ""passing the buck"" to happen between GoKL and GoI when it comes to money. GoI has now become stricter on accounts and fiscal management so a ""blank cheque"" is not going to be given any ways. GoKL would also be hesitant to reveal its sad financial position. Kerala state was actually on a big bubble, and politicians (mainly communists) used to sit on this bubble and call every other state as paupers. Kerala's economy was always ""money order"" economy, and the visible richness seen in the state was mainly due to the foreign remittances. Big homes, big cars and affluent life styles all were made through foreign remittances made through very many years. This style of living actually did not improve the state's financials. All these remittances did not lead to the state having more money to play around with. Now the bubble is burst. The current amount of foreign remittances will not be able to rebuild the state quickly. And when the people look up to the government (and the communists), they are also going to raise empty hands and say that as a state Kerala is broke.Centre rejects Kerala's demand for subsidised kerosene. GoKL will have to procure Kerosene at market rates, and looks like she wants the subsidy to come from central government. The state does not have any money to spare."

All the money now getting collected for relief and reconstruction efforts is going into Chief Minister's distress Relief Fund (CMDRF).

The latest example will be 25 lakhs provided as 'relief' by Pinarayi Vijayan to the family of the MLA from Chenagnnoor, Mr. Uzhavoor Vijayan, when he passed away. It was also reported that the relief fund for Ockhi cyclone victims was used to pay the bills of helicopter used by the CM to attend a CPI(M) party conference.

Right from the start of the tragedy, the focus was also on demanding ""ready cash"" payments. Central Govt. has clearly said that the ""Direct Benefit Transfer"" approach would be used. KL government had said that they would be giving Rs.10,000 for every family moving out of the relief camps. Now if GoKL plans to distribute the funds it has received in ready cash, this may be easily doable. But if this benefit also has to be done via banks it would be a challenge. No bank account details were collected at the refugee camps, and so as of today GoKL will not know to which accounts money have to be transferred to. And if they make ready cash payments; then most likely the money would only reach ""communist refugees"". But we must accept the support main stream media is giving GoKL. It has been coming up with news items after news items which helps in deflecting all problems faced in the rehabilitation. 100% literate Malayali crowd would soon once again be on the look out for lynchings in UP, statements made by Tripura CM and lack of toilets in northern India."

H&D of India, does not matter much.Congress opposes KPMG's free service.KPMG offers to be the free consultant partner for ""rebuilding Kerala"" after the floods . Looks like a major scam is on its way, and even CPI(M) is now a fan of foreign corporates and consultancies.These are funds for 2019. That's why so many political parties are objecting. Money laundering is the name of the game."
chetak,04 Sep 2018 12:53,"Intellectually Bankrupt Left Ecosystem exposed in Kerala Floods.Sep 03, 2018 Anjali GeorgeA wise man said once; ""Crisis exposes a person"". Rightly so, the Kerala Floods exposed many.One of the striking pictures of the devastating floods which killed over 400 people and displaced thousands was the condition of a bridge which connects Malayattur to Kodanad across the Periyar river in Ernakulam district. As the flood waters receded, what was left on the bridge was a part of all the filth that humans had thrown into the river water over the years. It was a testimony to all that’s wrong with us as a society. But this was not the only filth that the receding waters brought to the surface. It also exposed the intellectually bankrupt Leftist ecosystem that resorts to online ""mob lynchings"" and fake news to set their narrative. But this time, their agenda setting did not work as expected. On the contrary it brought out the chinks in its armor and proved once again that the intellectual cover that its cadre try to give their flawed political and social constructs is nothing but a sham.Attempts to set the narrative picked up pace soon after the flood waters started receding.Hundreds of brave personnel of the NDRF, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, state police, fire force and many more had participated in the rescue efforts. An affidavit filed by the state government in the Supreme Court reveals the extent of deployment.“59 rescue teams of NDRF with 207 boats, 23 columns of ARMY units with 104 boats, 94 rescue teams of NAVY with1 medical team, 9 helicopters, 2 fixed wing aircrafts and 94 boats and 36 teams of COAST GUARD with 49 boats, 2 helicopters, 23 fixed wing helicopters, 2 fixed wing and 27 hired boats, were deployed. AIR FORCE provided 22 helicopters and 23 fixed wing aircrafts, BSF provided 2 companies with one water vehicle team and10 teams of CRPF were deployed. 4100 Fire and Rescue Services personnel were engaged, and they operated 69 Rubber Boats. Odisha fire services provided 244 Firemen and 63 Rubber Boats”.Another group that played an equally stellar role in the rescue efforts was the fishermen. Expecting nothing in return, they rushed to the flooded areas with their canoes to save the stranded people.But then the party cadre, many of whom masquerade as independent journalists, could not digest the thought of any credit going to the uniformed personnel, because these soldiers are committed to the unity and integrity of India, something that their ideological brethren – the urban naxals – fight day in and day out.What if praising these men and women in uniform or the likes of Kanhaiya Kumar from Bihar who ran across the bridge in Cheruthoni in Idukki district with a baby held tightly to his chest evokes sympathy for other Indians in the minds of Keralaites? Any such feeling of empathy would hurt the politics of hatred and regionalism which they have carefully tried to cultivate in the minds of Keralites in the last few years to checkmate Hindutva gaining traction in the state.Apparatchiks found a way out to prevent this - praise the fishermen as the real rescuers and downplay the work done by the forces They thought that this romanticism of fisherfolk saving lives in a flood would help divert the attention away from others. But they grossly underestimated the people of Kerala, who cutting across politics and religion showered praise on all those who helped.The attempt to polarize was evident even in newsrooms. A journalist was heard asserting in his TV channel, that the national media had blacked out Kerala floods. He attributes it to the ‘tyranny of distance’. So, called intellectuals followed up such half-baked claims with tweets about ""United states of South India"", a pipe-dream for a separate nation for the south Indian states.Tweets and comments by some random crazy people and a dubious saffron-clad man linking the floods to food habits of Malayalees was paraded as some general authoritative statement to push the narrative that the Hindutva supporters had only disdain for Kerala. But once again, their sinister plot drowned in the outpour of love for Kerala from all across the country.When all their machinations flopped, they latched on to the Rs 700 crore UAE aid story. As the real facts emerged, Arnab Goswami did a report calling out those who floated the theory as a bunch of shameless Indians. The brain dead in the Left saw in it another opportunity to polarize and tried to give it a different spin. They went to town claiming that Arnab had insulted all Malayalees, but this flopped too. Even I have reasons to disagree with Arnab’s journalism, but lying to feed poisonous agendas is horrendous to say the least.The noise was also to divert people’s attention from their own government’s failure to deal with the crisis.But how pea-brained should they be to not realize that when they give all the credit to fishermen, it also throws up the question –what exactly was the CPM-led state government and its machinery doing during the flood?Sections of the intellectually bankrupt Leftist media struggled hard and is still trying its best to prevent a backlash against its favorite government for alleged mismanagement of the calamity. From the local committee dolts to the Lutyens 'liberal', they are desperate. Note the complete absence of reports in the national media, especially English, questioning the state government’s role. Over 400 people died, but the so-called investigative journalists aren’t even bothered about finding if the government messed up while opening the dams. Those who turned the world upside down over Gorakhpur hospital deaths are now shamelessly silent.When the floods started, we saw a `leading journalist’ questioning the genuineness of some photos of RSS workers helping flood affected. His news portal did a report that the pictures were from Gujarat.Maybe he was right about the photos in question, but the social media was literally bursting with reports and real photos of volunteers of Seva bharati, the service wing of the RSS, pro-actively helping in the rescue operations and relief work in Kerala. How many of these photos did this journalist or any liberal tweet to appreciate the good work?With their willingness to work in any adverse conditions, these selfless volunteers were indeed a tremendous source of help in many remote regions that got cut off as waters rose.When the comrades were allegedly threatening businessmen to pay up and trying to appropriate relief materials, thousands of Seva bharati workers went about silently doing their work - setting up relief camps, collecting and distributing food and other essential items and providing medical help. After the waters receded, thousands of them once again went around cleaning the dirt-filled houses, irrespective of the political affinity or religion of its owners.Naturally, the comrades are worried that the goodwill earned by their work will help saffron politics in the state.Their time-tested strategy to stop any saffron surge in Kerala has been to create a barrier between the people and the Hindutva outfits by demonizing the RSS. But thanks to the selfless efforts of the Seva bharati volunteers, their machinations have been punctured.And It is only a matter of time before their conspiracies fizzle out completely."

This also seems to be a good move considering that all Central Govt. aid etc. would be depending on the reports of the nodal agencies.Flood relief: We will give salary but don’t compel. Kerala govt. has mandated all government employees to donate one month salary (at one shot or as easy installments ). Any body who does NOT want to do that, should give that in instruction in writing. This is really absurd that in any other case such contributions are voluntary, and it is the acceptance to make such donations which is given out in writing. GoKL seems to be making this flood a money making excercise. Government officials will not make any statement in writing, which they know would cause them harm; which includes arbitrary transfers or some communist style instant justice. Nobody wants to get a black mark unneccessarily. And off course, such moves are not considered ""fascist"" or draconoian by the local intellectuals, and the award wapsi gang ."
chetak,05 Sep 2018 13:32,"Big fraud by Marxist govt in Kerala in the pretext of flood relief and reconstruction driveBig fraud by Marxist govt in Kerala in the pretext of flood relief and reconstruction driveThe first life-saving material to land in Kerala was the Bible!By Team PGurus - September 4, 2018 People in the field who closely monitored the water level were posting messages in the microblogging sites about the ulterior motives of the CPI-M leaders and the Kerala ministers.The CPI-M led Kerala government was caught with its trousers down as the demand for funds for flood relief and rehabilitation raised by Chief Minister (CM) Pinarayi Vijayan has been found to be a big hoax.What is causing concern is the delay by the Kerala Government in submitting to the Centre the official data about the extent of damages caused in the man-made floods.The Chief Minister who has been complaining from day one that the Narendra Modi-led federal government was victimising it because of the former’s secular, liberal, democratic and human rights policies was also campaigning through the mass media that the State needs more than Rs.40,000 crores ($6 billion) for the reconstruction of roads and other infrastructure facilities.Vijayan had told Prime Minister Modi who visited the State on August 18 that the recent man-made floods had caused a loss of Rs.20,000 crores ($3 billion). The Chief Minister’s claim was that 98,000 km road had been destroyed because of the floods and the State required Rs.13,800 crores ($2 billion) for re-laying the same. But senior officials of the Public Works Department in their stock-taking after the receding of the flood waters found that only 34,372 km of roads have been damaged and this could be reconstructed with just Rs.5800 crores. (The 98,000 km road includes 16,000 km long road built by the PWD, 82,000 km long village roads and 134 small bridges).The Prime Minister had issued a directive to the National Highway Authority of India to relay the damaged/ destroyed highways and the National Thermal Power Corporation and the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd to repair/ rectify/ replace the power system and transmission lines which were damaged in the man-made floods.What is causing concern is the delay by the Kerala Government in submitting to the Centre the official data about the extent of damages caused in the man-made floods. Interestingly, the Kerala Chief Minister in his daily interactions with the media had stated that the damages may cross even Rs.40,000 crores.The State is yet to respond to the queries made by the NHAI, NTPC and the PGCIL about the details of the damaged caused by the highways and power sector in the disaster. Pinarayi Vijayan did not expect the Prime Minister to make a declaration that the Centre would take over the reconstruction works caused by the man-made floods. Did the CPI-M led Kerala government want to make a big fortune out of the floods by claiming that the State had suffered massive destruction? The Prime Minister also went to the extent of declaring that the houses destroyed/ damaged in the floods would be rebuilt/ repaired under the Prime Minister’s Awas Yojana, a scheme initiated by the Centre for making houses available to all those without a roof over their heads.What caught the attention in the recent floods was the stance of the Kerala Government and the CPI-M in publicising the “damages” and “destructions” caused by the man-made floods. The Lok Sabha election is around the corner and the CPI-M, past masters in the game of election fund collection saw the heavy rains as an opportunity to collect as much cash under the garb of flood relief.The Marxists stand with egg on their face following the disclosures made by the UAE Government that there never was an offer of $100 million from them.If there was a main architect of the man-made floods in Kerala it would be the Marxist minister for power M M Mony. It was Mony, who vehemently opposed the opening of the shutters of the dams in Kerala, especially the Idukki and Edamalayar hydro electric projects in spite of advance warnings issued by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MOES)[1] about the impending heavy rains which were to ravage the State[2].Why was Mony near the Idukki Dam, when the water levels were rising? Was it to ensure that the engineers did not open the shutters of the dam? “Had the dams been opened as per the data given by the IMD and the ministry of earth sciences, this flood would not have occurred,” said a senior power systems engineer[3].The chief minister claimed that the IMD or MOES did not give an advance warning about the rainfall. When confronted with the press notes issued by these bodies, Vijayan was forced to retract from his allegations. Interestingly, the Kerala Government has filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court in response to a PIL by an Idukki resident stating that the unprecedented high level of water in the Mullaperiyar Dam, owned by Tamil Nadu should be brought down[4].Tamil Nadu government filed a counter to this statement but not before Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy giving a mouthful to his Kerala counterpart for spreading all kinds of canards about the floods. It was to divert the attention of the public from these two setbacks that the Marxist dominated media in Kerala came out with allegations that Prime Minister Modi had refused the $100 million offered to Kerala by the UAE Government.The Marxists stand with egg on their face following the disclosures made by the UAE Government that there never was an offer of $100 million from them. If a thorough probe is ordered into the factors that led to the delay in the opening of the shutters of more than 40 dams in the State, the CPI-M would be in for major trouble.The volunteers of World Vision, one of the first evangelical teams to reach the flood affected Kerala came with tonnes and tonnes of Bibles and registration forms for religious conversionThough there were heavy rains in the second fortnight of the month of July, it had not caused any major floods barring landslides at some high range locations. But the Marxist media aired close up shots of water gushing down the rivers to create an impression that Kerala has fallen prey to a major natural disaster.What is of concern is that the flood had literally damaged certain areas in the districts of Pathanamthitta, Ernakulam, Alappuzha, regions close to Periyar River. The floods inflicted maximum damage to places like Chengannur, Thiruvalla, and Aranmula where there is considerable Hindu population. Hundreds of people were caught up in the Aranmula Temple for days because the flood waters had swallowed the roads leading to the temple. But the Kerala Government refused to hand over the rescue and relief operations to the central forces and paid scant regard to the victims who got stranded in the temple as well as in other regions in these places.The local Marxist leaders, in fact, drove away the volunteers of Seva Bharati (a voluntary rescue team under the RSS who are always the first activists who reach any places coming under natural disasters) and seized all the relief materials brought by the Seva Bharati for the flood victims. This was done allegedly under the instructions of Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, the secretary of the CPI-M, infamous as a black magician as well as a sorcerer. More details about the rescue and relief drama staged by the Marxist volunteers will soon figure in the PGurus.The volunteers of World Vision, one of the first evangelical teams to reach the flood affected Kerala came with tonnes and tonnes of Bibles and registration forms for religious conversion[5]. The first life-saving material to land in Kerala was the Bibles! Evangelists came under the garb of disaster relief operators!People in the field who closely monitored the water level were posting messages in the microblogging sites about the ulterior motives of the CPI-M leaders and the Kerala ministers.On Sunday early morning (September 1, 2018) Pinarayi Vijayan left for the USA for a medical check-up.

IMD director general K J Ramesh said, “We’re providing this info on our website. If private players start giving info, then we can’t be held responsible if something goes wrong.” Bureaucrats said the state government’s key weather-related decisions including the opening of dam shutters, evacuation of people, etc are guided based on the forecast of IMD among other things.Recently, IBM’s The Weather Company dashboard was installed at the CM’s office, which has been giving regular weather update feeds. “We observed the feeds from The Weather Company were even more precise,” said another officer.Additional Chief Secretary P H Kurian said engaging private firms can bring a new perspective. He, however, refrained from commenting further. The government, right now, cannot act upon the information by private players as the IMD is the sole agency responsible for weather forecasting in India. It also provides meteorological observations and seismology.Asked about the IMD’s claim of providing weather forecast up to 3 km x 3 km, the officer said its predictions were “erratic” and “not reliable” when compared with the predicted rainfall and the realised rainfall. “When we analysed the IMD data on 9-sq km radius, we found there’s a big gap between the realised rainfall and predicted rainfall,” said the officer.Further, as per the BIS standards, a state like Kerala should have 258 rain gauges, as compared to the existing 69 stations. “We prefer automated stations, which will give us concurrent data. Right now, only five stations give us that. There’s no point in getting the data the next day,” the officer said.For planning of emergency evacuation, the government needs three months’ advance forecast on the rainfalls in the catchment areas. “Private players can bring such credible information,” said the officer.In fact, a Parliamentary Standing Committee that looked into Cyclone Ockhi had also suggested the IMD should collaborate with international firms. In its report tabled on April 4, it said: “The IMD must learn from best practices being followed globally to improve prediction of such a phenomenon. If needed, research should be undertaken to predict cyclones in collaboration with global organisations.”"
nandakumar,08 Sep 2018 11:15,India has a private agency for weather forecasting. Nothing prevents the Kerala Government from subscribing to their service out of funds voted by the State legislature. But I doubt if their forecasts are any better than IMD. The truth is that Indian monsoon is such a difficult phenomenon that most models come up short all too frequently.

Although it is too early to gauge what the ultimate outcome might be, the sightings of predatory, alien fish species in large numbers that appear to have found their way into the state's waterbodies, are turning out to be a cause of concern for the state.A team of researchers from the University of Kerala, the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies, and National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore carried out a quick initial assessment of the state's waterbodies to find 11 alien species in all — four of which are invasive, a report in The Hindu says.“Globally, floodwaters have proved to be a major route for the spread of invasive species,"" A Biju Kumar, a professor at the Department of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries, University of Kerala told The Hindu. ""Therefore, a precautionary approach is warranted while farming potential invasive (fish) along floodplains.”The school of alien fish appear to have washed into Kerala from ornamental and commercial fish farms in the state, said an India Times report. Farming certain predator fish species like piranhas are banned in the state, however, commercial dealers continue to rear them illegally.Some photographs of these non-native fish have been circulated on social media over the past few days. One even shows a few men grinning at their luck after having caught a fish the size of a full-grown human.Another point of concern, the report cited, is the fitness of some of the foreign species, particularly the species known as the African catfish. This particular type of fish can grow over 50kg in size by feasting on other fish and has no known natural predators.In the weeks since the flood, the red-bellied piranha — one of the deadliest freshwater fish known to man — has also been reported by fishermen. Another new species spotted in Kerala's newly-calm waters is the Arapaima (pictured), a vicious predator of Brazilian origin known to survive out of water for a considerable amount of time.While the sightings continue to raise concerns among Keralites, the ecological impact of having a sea of non-native, predatorial fish remains an uncertainty for now.Date: Sep 12, 2018"

Dileep,29 Sep 2018 9:02,"Aadhar exists in the UIDAI server. The ""card"" is simply a 'certified copy'. All the person need to do is to put the finger on the scanner at the facilitation centre, and the details will pop-up. I did that myself, when I went to register my mobile number. If you 'register' your mobile number, then you can use that mobile to get your aadhar as well.Bank account also exists within the core banking server. The passbook is only a certified copy. The bank branch can get your account number and print a duplicate passbook within minutes. If you had linked the account with Aadhar, the account is traceable instantly.So, this question of ""people don't have their passbooks or Aadhaar cards"" is moot. If you were a moron (or a privacy nut, or a terrorist) who did not take Aadhar and did not link the bank account... Then DEAL WITH IT!! You don't need govt help anyway!!Oh.. wait.. You CAN get Aadhar and Bank account in what? Two days!!. BTW, there is no concept of ""new Aadhar"". It is biometric based, so once you get an Aadhar, that is all there is. You can't get 'another'. The system will tell you that you already got one.This volunteer survey is to avoid malpractice. But us being us, there will be some embellishment etc."

The state govt. has still not given any concrete plan to central government on what they plan to do to bring back the state to its normalcy levels.And then on top of all this the entire cabinet of communists are now planning for a world tour (with a claim that they are there to collect relief funds). Who ever had wanted to contribute would already have done so by now. And how much of contributions can a minister (and his entourage) personally collect is also a big question mark. The Kerala communists have now made a tragedy into a tragi-comedy . They are just stealing money from the state's own citizens using various means including threats. And they are also now splurging on world tour programs.PS: Note the countries where the communists are planning to visit. Not even a single communist country out there. No China, no Cuba and not even the erstwhile soviet republics. For money and fun communists want to go to capitalistic places ."

Nugroho said there's no need for international aid other than the four priorities identified by Indonesia.The disaster agency has circulated guidelines that say foreign aid workers can be in the field only with Indonesian partners. Groups that sent foreign personnel to the disaster zone are ""advised to retrieve their personnel immediately,"" according to those guidelines.International aid groups with Indonesian sister organizations say foreign personnel they want to send are being vetted by the government in a process that takes several days or longer.In a belated response to the influx of international journalists, Nugroho said foreign reporters need to apply for a journalist visa to report on the disaster. It's likely the majority have already left.Meanwhile, this is just horrible: Possibly 5,000 people are buried in obliterated parts of the city and its surroundings where the force of the quake liquefied the soil and sucked houses into the earth. Kilometers (miles) of coastline were trashed by the tsunami and Nugroho said its waves were up to 11 meters (36 feet) high.

Literally lakhs of people are taking to the streets, protesting primarily the social justice war by the GoK.The Supreme court removed a law that a) Prevented women during their periods (actually bleeding) from entering ANY temple in KL and b) Women of age group 10 to 50 entering the Sabarimala Temple in response to writs filed by some activists. Both had been long standing customs.All political parties (Congi, Commie, Sanghi, everyone) welcomed the verdict initially. They missed the pulse of people totally.The GoK, like a freshly converted EJ, went to town 'implementing' this verdict, by a) making special facilities like separate q etc b) making reserved seats in buses going to the temple. When there was big outcry and people were taking to the streets, a third decision also came. Police women will be deployed to the Temple. ""Belief and Duty are different"" said the DGP, referring to the reluctance of some women to go.People, with a significant number of women, took to the streets, with no visible leaders in place. No slogans. Nothing typical to the political rallies. No leaders in jeep at the front. Aam Aurat holding banner in the front and Aam aadmi walking behind, all chanting the Ayyappa Saranam just like when making the trek. I did participate in one myself, and planning to go to the bigger one in the city coming weekend.It was way beyond the imagination of anyone. Congress was the first to realize this, and they started supporting the movement. BJP state leadership started swaying, but the central leadership and RSS were strongly supporting the SC verdict.Then the number of protestors shot up. So, netas had no way other than supporting it. I think the state netas of Congi and Sanghi are in support now, but central is still unsure.As of today, the govt has rolled back a lot. But the pandora's box is open."

This ban on women's entry materialized only in 90s when someone filed a case in the court and the court banned entry of women. What is the real history behind this, someone can explain."
UlanBatori,11 Oct 2018 6:42,"The Ayyappa Deity is worshipped in numerous temples. None of them have any ban on wimmens. Of course wimmens take a holiday from temples etc for a few dins a month. But I have not heard of any young wimmens going on the pilgrimage itself. Little children, yes. Old folks, yes. I thought that was very sensible practice given the sheer crush and chaos and absence of sanitation and basic facilities. Hopefully there was some special provision to care for the old folks and little kids. I don't know the local custom: don't the ppl who live nearby just go and worship there like at any other temple, no special costume or penance needed? Isn't it just the 4th quarter of the year when there is this huge rush with all its special rules?"
Dileep,11 Oct 2018 6:45,"Habal, it is a total fabrication. There may be a few violations of the custom, but it was very much there.I know first hand that in my childhood in the early 70s the custom was very much there. It was well known to everyone, just like the custom that you need to bathe and wear clean clothes to go to temple. Also, there is this old book 'Sree Bhoothanatha Sarvasvam' written in late 19th/early 20th century which detail all the legends, history and customs related to the temple.This 'choroottu' thing happen sometimes, but that would be done outside the main complex below the holy 18 steps, and women were never allowed to go up to the main complex. Violations did happen, like the infamous movie shooting in 1986 (which were actually very painful for us to hear). Also, it needs to be noted that the movie shooting and one of the 'choroottu' incident happened during commie rule.Anyway, past violations do not justify making it a custom. For example, people sometimes steal farm produce. So, does it make sense to make stealing legal?"
Dileep,11 Oct 2018 7:11,"Let me give some background of the Temple.This temple is situated in the western ghats. 9°26'04.5""N 77°04'52.7""E GPS. The nearest road head (used to be. it is washed out by the floods now) at Pamba 9°24'46.7""N 77°04'07.2""E from where we trek 4 km, first uphill by 1800ft elevation and then down by 400ft. The temple is open for 5 days every month, and for 41 days in the season. The only 'locals' are the tribals living so 30 km away at Attathodu. The only humans in the area are the folk who service the temple.The main complex is around 100ft X 100ft square built at a height of around 20 feet above the ground, originally to protect from wild animals. The 18 holy steps are built extremely steep, almost 80 degrees vertical, to prevent animals walking up. There was also a moat around this pedestal. climbing this step is the major part of the ritual, and the custom is that you need to take 41 days penance and carry the 'holy bundle of offering' on your head to do this. (The police will send you back if you do not carry it on your head. Not sure when someone will go to court for THAT)Anyone (except the women of age) can get to the main complex through the side entrance (which is built later. Aha!!! customs do change for convenience!!) and get darshan. There will be a long q for that as well.The penance is to take the life of a sanyasi. You should avoid all thoughts of $ex. I avoid looking at bollyboobs (on telly, print and hoardings) and watching food channel (to avoid craving for food). No problem at work, since women there are not 'objects of desire'. The custom is 41 days, but I do only 10 to 14 (Aha!! customs do change for convenience again)Purists do not take outside food, don't wear chappals etc.This 'holy bundle of offering' primarily contain a fully mature coconut, which is drained off the water inside and filled with ghee. This ghee is poured over the deity (abhishekam). There will be other offerings also, like rice flakes (aval/poha), rice puffs (malar), plantain, candy sugar (kalkant), honey, holy ash (bhasmam) etc."

Their conservativeness also some times reaches the level of boorishness (especially the way people from other states; once Tamil Nadu and now migrant labour from Northern parts of India are treated). For all social upliftment, egalitarian communist systems etc; I have my own female relatives who would wouch that an over crowded T Nagar market in Chennai,TN is much more safe (and gentlemanly) than a crowded bus in Kerala . The Supreme Court verdict may be purely on ""gender equality"" etc., but right after the verdict the communist government tried to spin this as their victory. Comrades were trying to take credit for some social reformations in the 1880s and 1920s when their party was not even in existence. The ""Sabari mala verdict"" was one good chance for them to prove that some change happened when they were ruling. And they could not understand the pulse of the common Keralite out there. The protests were way beyond what the pea-brained commie leadership (mainly from Northern Kerala) could fathom.

The GoKL is also relying on these devotees to fill up the state treasury. A campaign in these states indicating the actual situation at Sabari Mala and asking them not to donate too much money (Ayyappah is not cash-starved any ways) will also give a solid punch to the state government.

When these one-off incidents became common knowledge, it was an Ayyappa devotee who approached the courts demanding it to be legally banned. And then GoKL came up with a formal law which forbade women within an age group to enter the shrine. My first Sabari Mala pilgrimage was when I was around 12 years old. Even then it was clearly known that women of certain age group will not go to Sabari Mala (irrespective of whether a law was in place at that time or not). To be frank, it was also the rank commercialisation of this pilgrimage which now reached a level of ""all and sundry"" demanding entry rights and right to do what ever they please. My father had made this pilgrimage in early 1960s. And at that time they really had to trek up the hills, pretty much carried their own packed food etc. The temple itself was in very remote location (and serene), with minimal staff.

Only those who wish can visit the shrine. Nobody is forcing them that they should go to the temple. Those who are against the verdict and those who oppose the verdict have equal rights,” she pointed out.Let me be brutally honest; this whole case was filed by women who are in no way connected to Sabari Mala or Ayyappa devotees. Sabari Mala Ayyappa is predominantly a Hindu god with worshippers being South Indians. It is only very recently that devotees from MH etc. started coming in; mainly because of the Non-resident Keralites who builds Ayyappa temples where ever they are in large numbers. And along with that comes the problem of people who have no clue on how Kerala temples and its rituals getting involved, to ""prove a point"". Bhakti Pasrija has thoughts about dignity, while Kerala women are now actually saying that is not the ""dignity"" they want. The National Women's Commission chair person again from Northern India, finds it surprising that women in Kerala are actually opposing the ""freedom"" given to them. This temple has lots of uniqueness to it. Every Ayyappa devotee tries to attain the same godliness of the God he is going to worship. Even the police man who stands their for crowd control, is considered to be an Ayyappa (they follow the same traditions of the devotees). This is the only temple which is truely ""secular"". Men from any religion can go there. Looks like the people who talk about all this ""equality & dignity"" wants to make every temple a show piece; like the Akshardham temple at New Delhi or ISKON temple at Bengaluru etc. A place to just flaunt the wealth, and where even cakes (or any thing which a modern devotee (?) wants) is available for a price. Temples in Kerala generally have a much more ""faith based"" approach and is not like the typical tourist temples seen else where. arshyam wrote:Of course, unrelated persons like the petitioners might go to prove a point, but that's pretty much it.

Super example of a true devotee. Kept the place spick and span as opposed to the trash dump that recent desis have reduced this holy and historic place to. She is, per official Adhyatma Ramayanam of Thunjath Ezhuttassan, the one who gave Him the critical gyan on who exactly abducted Sita Bibi and what direction he flew off in. I think someone else directed Him to go ask Sabari Bibi what had happened. Very authoritative scholar, among other things. The Pampa river there is per Malloo Ramayana, the place near whose banks constituted the Vanara Sena's domain (Emperor Sugriva's Empire). Then and now.

And now as per this report in Malayalam, Attorney General K.K Venugopal clearly says that Sabari Mala verdict is not right. Supreme court accepts a petition that the Devaswom Boards of Kerala has to be disbanded. The petitioners include Subramaniam Swamy and T.G Mohandas; known ""right wingers"".

The communists have already started a campaign to say that all the current customs are just part of Brahminical hegemony (and thus meaningless). Countering this would require some tact and careful planning. ""Threats"" may not be work, but a genuine plea to the devotees highlighting why the temple had to be closed down may work. The ""Pandalam Royal Family"" is still considered to be Lord Ayyappa's family, with some mandatory articles for worship still coming in from their household. The community of the ""chief priest"" (Thantri); the Kerala Brahmins are the best turn-coats now available for the use of the communists. Many among this community to prove their communist/socialist mind set, will be willing to speak against the ""chief priest"" and the religious practises at Sabari Mala. The communists in the worst case scenario can try the Chinese/Russian trick of identifying ""priests"" with a communist mindset from this community and kind of oust the present Thantri family. For all of these people; this is also a matter of some big money (which looks like is the ultimate God).When such activities are planned and for it to succeed a message has to go out; ""The Ayyappa of Sabarimala, has seized to exist in the old awatar. The idol seen there today has lost its sanctity/chaithanya and is now a piece of stone."". Perhaps the Pandalam Royal Family and the head priest would have to ""reinstall"" the diety at another place, which would also make Sabari Mala pilgrimage a redundant excercise."

Not only the temple complex, surrounding hills & regions assumes certain mystical power. The whole process of whorship is an occult parctise or based on Tantra as we call it in local toungue. Even the priest here who does poojas is known as Tantri (tHan-thRee). He is not known as poojari as in other temples.Wherever other local Ayyappa temples around are concerned it came into existence bcoz of local people's wish. But in Sabarimala, Ayyappan is worshipped in the way HE wanted, i.e.as per HIS wish + tantric worship needs certain atmosphere. It cannot be provided in every other Ayyappan temple. So we cannot use that logic of women going to other Ayyappan temple as basis for women entry into Sabarimala Ayyappan temple.As Dileep mentioned, dec jan is the important period. Men practising austerity for 40 days before visiting is only for this period i believe. [Pls correct me if iam not right] Rest of the months when temple is open, devotees do not need the same austerity practised to see Ayappan. Thats why during the other months they dont use the 18 steps. Also as i heard, during other months Ayyappan is not worshipped in the same way(tantric pooja is not the same).As i heard, these days women go. Less restriction. + Women generally go to temple when they are not mensurating. Woman don't mensurate for few months after delivery. So this ""choroottu"" could have happened during those days when Ayyappan was not worshipped in such significant manner as in dec jan period. + the rules were not strict in non season days. This culture of women of age not visiting the temple even during non season days is more as a respect for what HE is (a brahmachari) & also seen as the extension of the way he is worshipped in dec jan months, as i heard."

To be frank, I don't know if the people involved here (GoKL, Devaswom Board, the North Indian lady petitioners and hizzhoners) were even aware of how the worship is done at Sabari Mala. I often say about the magnificent Akshardham temples seen in Northern India, only to add that that is NOT how temples in Kerala are considered as places of worship. Rest of the months when temple is open, devotees do not need the same austerity practised to see Ayappan. Thats why during the other months they dont use the 18 steps This again was a practise which started quite late. Every Malayalam calendar month the temple opens for 4-5 days and that is only for the basic poojas. Many Ayyappa devotees now use these days to make their annual pilgrimage as it is less crowded. And no one needs to take the 41 days vruth. But here again because of such relaxations people don't just go there in a way they please. Non-veg food, alchohol etc. is not taken when they come in to pray. jpremnath wrote:The judgement just cancelled the previous order banning entry of women on grounds of being 'unconstitutional'...No ordinance from state govt can cover it now, only a constitutional amendment or some sort of ordinance at centre can do something about it.

These ""poor students"" were all kids of rich NRIs who were filling to pay Rs. 50 lakh and above to make them Daaktaars (MBBS) . And off course to keep the minority community owning the college happy.

The commies have some clues; that is to try split the Hindu community again on caste lines. From what I see in social media, there is a big attempt to get this breaking up done. So far they have not made much progress, but there are some specific campaigns to be rolled out next week in which even the state Chief Minister would try to convince the devotees. The pro-Sabari Mala campaign can only survive if they go at the current momentum at least for a few days beyond Oct 18th, when the temple is to be opened for the poojas. And from what I read in the news papers, even basic facilities at Sabari Mala and Pampa have been destroyed and not even put back to 40% of its normal efficiency. Even men devotees would find the pilgrimage a tougher one this time."

UlanBatori,13 Oct 2018 1:12,"Hope the Devotees have some cohesion of purpose and plans beyond just jumping up and down for a few days. Looking up this thread, you can see that custom has certainly evolved over the centuries, and in very recent years the Pilgrimage Tourism bijnej has caused extreme stress at all major Kerala temples. This is a fact. It is a very sad commentary on the 80%-majority that this deterioration is allowed to happen. IMO this is the massive opportunity to set things right: the confluence of the floods and the SC verdict. Wake-up call. I am reminded of the reaction of a (Malloo of my acquaintance, typical of many) when faced with the facts of Indian law regarding property/ inheritance, vs. tribal superstitions.All that Indian Law doesn't apply here! That is really not an approach with a lot of promise. The SC was merely deciding what was the correct interpretation of the Constitution. All said and done, it is a public place that receives public funds, and is probably situated on public land. They cannot say that people are denied admission simply because of age or gender. If the claim is that ""it is too hard for wimmen"", well.... I am sure the SC can dictate that it be made less stressful with better facilities and orderly processes. People used to walk to Kasi and Ramesvaram in the old days. They take trains/buses or SUVs now, and the buses are airconditioned. So things DO change, hain? So the Devotees have to seek smarter ways to decide what is truly important, and try to win those. How exactly is their right to worship, hurt? The claim that Lord Ayyappa will be hurt, is not sustainable in court: who exactly claims to speak for Him? The claim that ""this is the way we have been doing things onlee"" is not sustainable. Didn't Swami Vivekananda call Keralam a ""Bhranthalayam"" precisely because of ""traditional ways""? I am sure that every argument seen above in this thread was made with equally strong feelings then too. I have heard of a Gandhian freedom fighter who stood picketing the front of some office or other, as part of the demand to let people of all castes into temples. The ""Holy Devotees"" collected a bucket of poo, went up to the window above him and poured it on him. I am sure to great applause by other ""Holy Devotees"". No sympathy even at home: legend was that his kind grand-brats would go up to him and hold their noses before scampering away. Yet today (I hope!) none of those arguing here would argue to go back to the customs of those time, where admission to temples was restricted to people based on birth? I am not claiming to know The Right Answer, just pointing out that the SC decision was probably the only one possible for the SC to take, given that the case came up before them. IMO it was a no-brainer, notwithstanding all the heights of oratory that the defendants achieved. Bringing in the bleeding etc, as an example, is a ""red herring"" introduced to raise hackles. Most temples demand a ""Punyaham"" (purification ceremony, costs a good deal of money) if there is any blood or other body fluids other than sweat emitted to the floor inside the inner part of the temple. This is one of the few places in India where spitting is not approved. My Evil 6th coujin is still reminded by unkind relatives that when he was given the ""teertham"" at a temple during his ""choroonu"" or whatever, he assumed that he was to wash his mouth with that, so he did so and spat it out. If an adult did that it might be a big issue. Gender of person bleeding is not the issue. Now the issue is that 41 days is longer than 30 days. Brilliant! Convincing argument! Or is it? What exactly is wrong with a woman observing strict penance through 41 days? Have there not been women Rsis throughout the ages (at least 400+ per my knowledge during Vedic times)? How did they meditate long enough to be considered Tenured Rsinis, complete with Divya dristhi and the power to issue fatwas, hain? OK, they don't go inside a temple on those days, but there is nothing to say that they are not fasting/ avoiding eating pakistanis etc. These advances should have been made ages ago BY yindoo society, and the facilities around the place improved to the level that showed the reverence in which it is held. Keeping the surroundings worse than an pigsty and claiming that this is to maintain the ambience of herrowism, is a garbage argument. I claim that Shri A. showed what He thought of that, by washing and scraping the surroundings. Long overdue and His patience has been, well, Divine. The Rsi Sabari Bibi would have approved of the cleansing. If the Herrowic Devotees want to up the ante they can set up special penances etc that are voluntary. It is really up to Shri A, not the Devaswom Board or anyone else, to decide what constitutes adequate worship, hain? As long as all worshippers conduct themselves with proper decorum and respect and consideration for other worshippers? One great objection of the Holy Devotees is that seeing wimmens around might break the Purity of their Penance by exciting their (never mind). I'd say that is a bit tough, it indicates a very juvenile level of maturyti, and an inadequate level of focus on worship if the mere sight of a wimmens in the vicinity will break their concentration*. Are they sure that through their 41 dins of penance they don't see any wimmens? This, from the SC's pov, is surely not a sufficient reason to deny the basic right of worship to anyone. One way out for those who feel that this is a big problem, would be to shut themselves in a place where they are not likely to see any women at all, for 41 days. When they go to worship at temples, put bags over their heads with ear-plugs and nose-clamps so that they cannot see, hear or smell women. For those who do these, there could be a special Darshan arranged, where they are allowed to do the Darshan with viewing tubes placed in front of their head-bags, allowing them to see only the Inner Sanctum. If they have no trouble during the 41 days, then they have no trouble with women being present at the temple either. ********************The aspect that no one is discussing here, is the origin of the quasi-military form of the pilgrimage, which is the Macho Pride part. Everyone is worried about opening that can of commies. Because.... there is at least one version that says the ""pilgrimage"" commemorates a campaign to attack, loot and destroy a Buddhist place of worship. I have seen a set of broken small figurines at the temple at u-no-where, next to the Ayyappan shrine, that we were instructed to Not Look At, because looking would bring evil. The (whispered) explanation was that those were former Buddhist vigrahas. They have now disappeared. Just saying what I have heard. I think there is some part of this history that is today suppressed/ignored on the theory that if ignored it will go away.Then again, I have never heard of Buddhist shrines/communities anywhere else in Mallostan or TN, so I don't know where all that came from. Summary: Yindoos need to wake up.* Reminds me of the irreverent *ope Selection Process that we won't go into here because it will certainly and needlessly offend people."
Dileep,13 Oct 2018 7:59,"Kanson's post have several factual inaccuracies.Tantric worship is the generic name for the Temple centric worship system in Bharatham. It is distinct from the 'Vedic' system. A lot of philosophies and 'gods' are freely integrated into what we call 'hinduism' today. It was Bhagavan Sree Sankaran (the one born at Kalady near my place and walked all over the nation centuries ago) who made the integration formal and established the coexistence of both.EVERY Temple here in KL is worshiped according to the Thantric texts (called 'aagama' which means 'tradition'. Vasishta, Bharadwaja and others have 'aagama' named after them. EVERY Temple have a designated 'Thantri', who installs the Deity and serves as the 'spiritual father' of the Deity. There are periodic rituals to be performed by the Thantri.Position of Thantri is hereditary. If I want to create a temple today, I need to find a qualified Thantri and get it done. Thereafter, the position becomes the hereditary right for that family. (All Thantri families except one are brahmins. One is Ezhava). My father was involved in this process for a small temple in my village.Thazhamon is one of the most known families, who has the 'Thantram right' for Sabarimala. They are Thantri to a number of temples. Most of the Ayyappa temples have them as the Thantri.Sabarimala is special in that a lot of the rituals require direct involvement of the Thantri. The reason being, the temple used to be open only three times a year, so the thantri rituals were conducted then. Other temples that open every day don't need Thantri every day.Other than that, the worship at Sabarimala is typical to a Kerala temple.Facts on the penance and the 18 steps:1. 41 day penance and the holy bundle is REQUIRED to climb the 18 steps any time, whether it is the 'season' or the '1-5 of month'. The bundle rule is enforced. Penance can't be checked anyway. People reduced this down to two weeks now.2. Women going to sabarimala was a VIOLATION of the custom. They climbing up into the main complex is considered 'desecration' which needed 'punyaham'. It had been the rule for long.I dug up my copy of 'Sree Bhuthanatha Sarvasvam' published in 1948 and checked. It clearly mentions that women between 10-50 are not allowed, but there are violations even then. The 1991 law gave legal credentials to the custom. If past violations are reason for present validation, let us make 'groping' legal. Evidence is coming out now that groping was rampantly happening in the past, hainjee?The pilgrimage is NOT inspired or re-enactment of any attack. It is the reminiscent of people actually visiting the human named Manikandan who turned ascetic and took abode at an old temple in the jungle he frequented during his soldiering days for securing the trade route. The old temple could have been Buddhist, but most probably it was abandoned, or even been ransacked by the highway robbers whom Manikandan quashed.For those who (is $exually active) say taking the penance is easy, try complete abstinence for 30 days and see how your mind craves for 'it'. I don't know about you, but I get very uncomfortable myself.It is difficult."

Hindu society over time might accept this judgment (though going by the vehemence of womenfolk who are protesting, it will take a really long time), but this blatant inequality in interfering only in Hindu traditions is grating on more and more people. Such things only end up invoking a reactionary response in sticking more strictly to one's traditions. Like how junior Bush's post-9/11 comment on ""clash of civilisations"" brought out the beards and burqas all over the world. Who benefits from these moves?"
UlanBatori,13 Oct 2018 8:11,"Hindus should appeal that one to the SC, hain?Nah, scratch that, I wrote it before I read the deep legal brilliance of the Petition: Pointing out that the petitioner failed to establish that there’s a denial of women’s entry to Kerala mosques, the division bench of Chief Justice Rishikesh Roy and A K J Nambiar dismissed it. The petition expounded that in context of the Sabarimala Verdict {first error: says this is tit for tit, no pun intended}, that ordered the entry of women of all age groups into the Sabarimala temple, the same courtesy must be given to Muslim women who allegedly face restrictions in praying at mosques.The petitioner Swamy Dethathreya Sai Swaroop Nath, the state president of Akhila Bharatha Hindu Maha Sabha, Kerala unit, put forward his petition stating that Muslim women are being discriminated by not allowing them to enter and pray in the mosque’s main prayer hall, as reported by Live Law.His petition directed attention to the fact that Muslim women were allowed entry in Mecca but not in Indian mosques. He also added that the imposition of a dress code like purdah for Muslim women would enable anti-social elements to misuse it and commit crimes. {Huh?? What has that got to do with mosque entry? Other than painting ""Kick me, I am a Bigot!"" on the musharraf of the Petitioner?}“Thus, women of the Muslim community were being disgraced and discriminated against which was against Article 21 and 14 of the Constitution,” his plea said, insisting that it was an encroachment into the realm of personal liberty and social security.I don't know the full text of the Petition, and how much it got distorted in reporting, but at first reading it sounds like a jumbled mess of insinuations with no facts. And one might well ask, duh! How tough can it be to get factual documentation of things that we all ""know"" to be true? IOW, this sounds like an angry, pompous and EXTREMELY ill-prepared stunt by the Swamy. Lacking the very basic preparation such as , duh! find someone who has actually had their rights trampled on. Must not have occurred to these Holy Jeeniuses? They have just made it orders of magnitude more difficult to open up the mosques. Then again, the political point to be scored may have been exactly that: to prove ""bias against Hindus"" rather than insist on uniform application of the Constitution to all Indians. I see nothing in the judgement that shows bias against Hindus. It shows bias against idiots maybe, like asking: "" Aiyyoo! Shouldn't you show evidence that rights have been denied to people, before you ask us to correct the Rights Denial?"" IOW, the Petitioner is either an idiot (not likely) or had absolutely no intention of winning that case."
UlanBatori,13 Oct 2018 8:26,"Dileepji: Thx. Would like to find out about the Buddhist figures though. I have peeked at them, of course, and yes, they did look something like the figures you see from Xi-stan. They were very ancient, pitted stone etc. Did not look like figures from yindoo temples. The sources for the legend about how they came to where they were, are not likely to be wrong. Curious: What highway crossed those parts?"
Dileep,13 Oct 2018 10:03,"UB Saar.. I never heard about the figurines. Maybe they were indeed remnants of old Buddist existence. But I am 400% sure there was no conflict. If there was any, at least some insinuation about it would have been there in the legends. Like 'asuras' were livingthere and Ayyappa chased them away etc. The only conflict we here was about the highway robbers (robber king udayan of Karimala particularly)The highway is essentially the trail that later became Kottayam-Kumili Road. It was the route to the Madurai kingdom, through which the Pandalam kings came down to Kerala. The trade with TN was being affected by the robbers, and Manikandan (soldier as per one legend, adopted prince as per another) was deputed to clean up the area."

True. The petition which was filed at Kerala HC, was filed by a person who had no locus standi (i.e non-Muslim), and he had no supporting evidence to justify his petition. Where as in Sabari Mala case, the petitioners were all Hindu women; who conveniently was represented by a Muslim lawyer. But now the women themselves have filed a petition, and we need to watch how that goes. But to be frank, I have serious doubts on the interpretation of ""secularism"" when it comes to Islamic belief systems.Dileep wrote:The trade with TN was being affected by the robbers, and Manikandan (soldier as per one legend, adopted prince as per another) was deputed to clean up the area.Sir, but I am not really happy to see how the things are flaring up in Kerala. Politics (and the dirty games) have now taken over the actual demand of the true Ayyappa devotees. The communists are now active on all media outlets trying to polarise the Hindu society on caste lines. And there are also idiots like the actor idiot Kollam Thulasi whose statements are actually detrimental to Sabari Mala. In the political game, I hope the Ayyappa devotees come out unscathed. The only hope seems to be in the Thantri and Pandalam Royal families who are saying that they want a peaceful settlement and are trying to keep all politicians at a distance. The main stream media is now completely backing the communists, in their attempt to demoralise and polarise the Hindu community in caste lines."
Sachin,13 Oct 2018 11:23,"Looks like more nastier games are being plannedTrupti Desai to visit Sabarimala soon.Trupti Desai is challenging the devotees: PS Sreedharan Pillai {of the BJP}.And on the Kerala floods & subsequent ""begging challenge"", looks like only the Kerala Chief Minister has been given authority to proceed. Rest of his cabinet will have to stay put in KL."
UlanBatori,13 Oct 2018 18:14,"IMO, the game is about the huge tourist revenue (and associated souvenir/picture etc sales) that Sabarimala brings: the commies etc want to grab the whole pie there. Devotees need to watch out for this and get organized, and figure out what is REALLY important. Again, I think the desired solution will be a clean, peaceful, environmentally sustainable and quiet, calm environment for real Bhakti. A calm evaluation of say, last year's situation will show why Shri A. Himself and Rsi Sabari Herself would both be disgusted at what the whole ""pilgrimage"" had become. Why can't SabariMala become a model for the rest of India and Hinduism on how mass worship can be conducted well, with the original and most valued concepts of Sanatana Dharma valued, way over evolved rituals and micro-practices? I am not sure what standing the Pandalam Royals etc have, any more. If they own the place, it is their fault that things have deteriorated so far. IMO the issue of what Moo-Moos want to do to their wimmens and vice versa, is best left to the Hyooman Rites bibis. I assume this Trupti de Sai is one of those? Look at it this this way: I don't honestly give a ***** what others do in their places of worship as long as they are not hoarding weapons and making bombs there. If the whole Pakistan Army was allowed to enter mosques in LaHore clad in their standard uniform of Burkhas and Boots, it won't change the situation at SabariMala one bit. So why waste energy on those things? If there is a move to file lawsuits, file 1000 well-coordinated lawsuits, not frivolous ones. Let them collect those into one massive Class Action suit, that will at least get some traction. Try to get sane control of the tourist scam. It is very nice to see devotees coming from as far as Andhra and all parts of TN and Karnataka, but ultimately I do have to wonder why (not that it is any of my business if the real driver is worship, but is it? Or isn't it a tourist boondoggle? ) But all that requires a level of clear thinking and leadership among yindoos that simply does not exist. This is all aggravated by a set of rigid and narrow ""rules"" that have little to do with original precepts. Like ""temple is open only 5 days a month"". WHY? ""Only the days in December are Holy."" WHY? These were rules made for when the Pandalam Royals found it too cold to be in the Swiss Alps? Or rules made for a beautiful local temple set up for the local village of 100 people to go worship. Not for 2 million in a month. These are the things that make it so hard for aam Malloos to go worship at their local temples any more: a temple made for 20 ppl to worship at a time, is flooded with 1000 coming in hordes of buses. Pushing and shoving, no concept of orderly conduct or leaving an inch of space between bodies... talking at the top of their voices when they are not yelling out their prayers? THIS is the New Mode of Hindu Worship? Is it any wonder that Shri A and Rsi Sabari showed what a real ""flood"" can be?"

That is quite known. It is pretty much known that Kerala's finance is also sustained in a big way by the big temples in the state, like Sabari Mala and Guruvayurappan temple at Guruvayur. I am just talking about the story 30 years back. Both these temples were not crowded as we see it today. Guruvayur temple was crowded (for a 8 year old boy), but even then Sabari Mala was not. Poor transport conditions, and the fact that Ayyappa did not have a pan-India belief like what we see today helped. But today for GoKL, all these temples are money making schemes. I am not sure what standing the Pandalam Royals etc have, any more. If they own the place, it is their fault that things have deteriorated so far. Politically and may be socially they may not hold much clout. But as per the current legend associated with Sabari Mala, Lord Ayyappa was part of this Royal family. Secondly the Thiruvabharanam (holy ornaments) to be put on the diety still comes from the Pandalam palace. So from a religious perspective the royal family still have a say. And the fact that they are politically neutral may actually help them. But many of the members of the royal family are card carrying commies, with the palace also a place which had helped many commies in hiding (during their fights with Travancore kings). But when it comes to Sabari Mala, the royal family has taken a consistent stance.But I do agree with you that, it is the rapid commercialisation of Hindu temples in Kerala (mainly to get more money), which also has led to this mess. There are numerous temples still there in Kerala, which is actually serene and helps people get a higher feeling of devotion."
Dileep,13 Oct 2018 22:24,"Well, I wouldn't say the temples were ""made"" money making. We aren't that smart. We aren't smart enough to think that ""if you build it, they will come"". That is a very massa concept. Here, first a lot of people show up. After the facilities and infra starts to crumble, we realize that hey, somehow now we seem to have some money, so let us improve some facilities (and siphon some of this money out)Secondly, it is a 400% lie that the govt is taking temple money. The DB accounting is separate, so the govt can't just take any of the money. What they can do is let the DB babus to siphon off/skim/kickback. Some other arguably legal adjustments also do happen, like the DB money being used to buy vehicles for the DB minister/babu folk. But those can't cross departmental boundaries.Yak Herder wrote:""temple is open only 5 days a month"". WHY?""Only the days in December are Holy."" WHY?

UlanBatori,13 Oct 2018 23:07,"Trouble is that this boxes us into a terrible situation where the answer to everything is: ""Because!"" One faces the prospect of explaining to the Supreme Court that ""we"" are fine and dandy with millions of ""us"" wading through poo-filled Pampa River ( I am citing reports from experience) to walk up the Holy 18 steps every year, but our Pure Beliefs won't allow women to walk the same path with or without a good bath. Because we are Holy onlee. On the temple opening timings, my guess is that if the temple stays open 18 hours a day for 330 days a year, people will schedule worship appropriately and after 10 years no one will miss the Holiness of waiting for hours for the Nada to Open. They will laugh at the very idea of such an atrocious arrangement. The temple just needs to hire more pujaris to make this happen and have a more organized process for re-decorating and preparing the Inner Sanctum. None of that violates any holy concept. IMO there are many perfectly good Believers who refuse to contemplate going to The Temple in the neighborhood on Special Days. Because it is very hard to pray peacefully in a bazaar environment.To bring in an even more blasphemous example: I was once told that the ski resorts in the Rocky Mountains were once places to which only men travelled. OK, maybe men and agile girffriends because there was no danger of Bibi/Bacche coming there. Why? Because one had to be pretty agile and foolhardy (or drunk) to leap on to the ChairLift as it slowed down for a moment at the bottom. Then someone invented a Chair Lift that did an elaborate low-level maneuver that kept it at crawling speed on level ground, but allowed the main climb and descent to proceed fast. Result? Old folks and kids could easily get on and off. Suddenly, the bijnej of the resort itself, and even of the mountaintop cafe, boomed. You could sell Ben-Gay and Geritol in the Store, as well as kids' toys and clothes and shoes. Families came along for the weekend holiday, because they could get on the chair-lift and go up to the top, and sit sipping chocolate in the warm cafe there, watching Dad/Hubby/Son go zooming down the slopes with the wind whistling through the holes in their heads. Wasn't this sheer sacrilege, hain? Climb a MOUNTAIN, get to the top of a ski slope, without being a skier? Share the ChairLift with geezers and brats, not with houris like James Bond? Yeah, but the increased sales overcame all such resistance. The advertising showed a portly momma in ski goggles under We've Slid a Long Way, Baby! instead of the Rugged Tanned (but White) He-Man VP Sales with the half-starved SuperModel on his arm. And likewise, 10 years from now (more like 10 weeks from now!), like it or not, the advertisement for the Real SabariMala Worshipper will feature a portly Malloo matron. Maybe they WILL set up a Chair Lift (maybe a Helipad too) to the adjacent hill and a Walkway Bridge across to SM. Disney-Pandalam Rejorts. You know that soon Cheen tourists will zip past Mt. Kailash and around Lake Manasarovar in pressurized, air-conditioned luxury sipping whatever they sip over there, in their Mag-Lev super-Bullet Trains built by Pakistan Rel Ltd. 5 hours, Beijing-Manasarovar. Stay at the 50-floor Oberoi-Sheraton-Xi opposite Mt. Everest. Stroll to the top of Mt. Kailash on an Escalator. The Hardy Pilgrim who takes on the Suffering to Build Character and Reinforce Faith, has their days numbered, sorry."

What they can do is let the DB babus to siphon off/skim/kickback. Some other arguably legal adjustments also do happen, like the DB money being used to buy vehicles for the DB minister/babu folk. But those can't cross departmental boundaries.I have my own doubts here, and perhaps may have to use the RTI route to get the amount figures. At Sabari Mala, a lot of Kerala government services are used, that is mainly Kerala Police, Kerala Fire & Rescue Services, Kerala State Electricity Board etc. Do the Travancore Devaswom Board ""pay"" for these services? If yes, what is the rate charged? I don't think all these folks work for free at Sabari Mala. What I feel (again, I don't have a written statement to corroborate my claim) is that all the state departments who offer their services at ""Sabari Mala"" charge the ""Devaswom Board"" a very inflated charge. These departments and Devaswom Board are all managed by the same entity; the Kerala Govt. So no one will ever dispute the money demanded by the Kerala Govt. Departments. I have some connections with a small temple, which has a festival once a year (a ceremony which has a duration of 48 hours max). This event any way is noted by Kerala Police, and if ""police bandobust"" has to be arranged, the temple administration has to submit an application well in advance to provide the police men. A some between Rs. 10,000-15,000 has to be deposited at the treasury. Once this is done, men from the ""A.R camp"" are detailed to provide security at the temple, and the local Sub Inspector (and the ""Night Round Officer"") would also come on do periodic checking. That being the case, I don't think Kerala Police etc. are doing some charity work at Sabari Mala. They all charge a huge amount for the services rendered."
Pulikeshi,14 Oct 2018 0:30,"While lots of idiocy aka baits on social justice theories have been thrown around on this thread from every side of the debate...PS: At the outset let me clearly state that I am agnostic to whether women of a particular age should be allowed to Sabarimala or not.I’ll make a few points perhaps not being considered in this debate: Every temple is built with a different context - Some are considered self-arose, others are tombs of great kings, others are subscriptions to a particular parampara, etc.In this case Sabarimala has a presiding deity that has chosen to be a Naisthik Brahmachari - not to be in presence of any possible temptation. Legally the presiding deity in a temple is a Juristic person - a perpetual minor!!See for example: Hindu Deity as a Juristic Person - Vidya Varuthi Thirthia Swamigal v. Baluswami Ayyar (1922) There are many temples in India with very particular parampara and rules to entry and participation. The question legally is really who is permitted to visit the temple at the sufferance of the presiding deity.There was never therefore a ban on entry for women, nor is there a right to entry for women In fact this was never about rights, it was always about sufferance of the deity - as in Who I allow in my home, in my presence, is my right!That the Atheist Communist Politburo in China decides who is the real incarnation of the Dalai Lama is not in question here, but is indeed the same bad after taste left in the mouth, when Atheist Leftist decide whose suffarance the presiding deity has to endure. That this is a privilege and not a right is lost in this muddle headed thinking. It is not even the argument that Masjids should have equal rights for women to pray side-by-side with the men, or for women mullahs, or for that matter Christian Churches should have women priests, that they can hear confessions, etc. The argument is singularly that of whose father the deity allows to be in their presence within the sanctom santorum of the temple. The argument is that simple, the activist Supremes unlike the scholars of yore, have lost their understanding and genius of the Dharmic codes from the various Smritis where - Corporations, Charitable entities and Temples with their presiding deities were empowered as Juristic persons who had human representatives, failing which they became wards of the state and their rights were to be protected by those elected and sitting on high benches of the law. The Supremes have made a mockery of themselves by not protecting the rights of presiding deity at Sabarimala. The sane women of Kerala seem to agree. This is nothing more than the idiocy of the secular invading the divine. The Supremes have violated the rights of a Juristic person - a perpetual minor- a Naisthik Brahmachari and committed activist tyranny on his sufferance of who he wishes to audience."

I have no argument with you, but I find your trivialization to pedophila in real distaste.It may be 2018, but there is no escaping the profane!The Juristic Person is a concept that came from our Smriti was adopted into the Indian Constitution. That this has been adopted into Common Law is not a commonly known fact in the deracinated Indians following Western models without introspection. Courts in India use this principle to act on the interests of the deity even today - whether it be Ayodhya or several other legal cases. To date no one has moved the courts with this argument, that does not mean, that the argument itself has no merit. It is well held principle that Mosques are not Juristic persons, but Temple Deities and Sikh Scriptures are and therefore have rights as a - perpetual minor - who is either the ward of citizens real humans nominated in their interest or the ward of the state.In fact, I’d argue that the India State should get out of the business of running temples or regulating who can participate in them, and let the Dieties decide whose sufferance they would choose to endure. It is rather irrelevant what secular and other useful idiots think of who the Diety ought to sufferance in audience! The rights of the devotee or otherwise lesser seculars cannot trump the owner of the house - the perpetual minor - the divine Temple Diety!"

The Supremes merely opinioned on the rights of women, not even devotees, to temple entry. AFAIK they did not grapple with the grievous injury caused to the rights of the Diety in question. In fact no one has made such arguments before the courts.I’d go one step futher (especially as I have clearly stated - I am agnostic if women enter this temple or not, but the principle the Right is fighting on is incorrect and the principle the Left is fighting on is a misapplication of a Western nuisance of secular progressiveness on an Indian society that has no need for it) - This has nothing to do with paramatman, nothing to do with Acharya’s Gurus, belief, or non-belief, nothing to do with the rights of women, men or boys & girls.Here is my recommendation to the Sabrimala Trust - shutdown the temple if they force you to continue the sufferance beyond the choice of the Diety.If you do not, then you did not hold the choice of the deity that seriously in the first place and therefore will diminish the sanctity of the place."

Dileep,14 Oct 2018 10:26,"Who decides the matter of Deities? (Note.. I am not saying 'gods'. Let us talk about 'Dieties' which is the subject matter here)Deity is installed by humans as a focal point for their worship. If you are enlightened in one of the 'sidhantas'you don't need this, but most of the people aren't, so a Deity is required.When a Deity is installed, a 'personality' is given/derived/assumed based on the circumstances. It doesn't matter HOW the details gets put in place, but once people believes it, it becomes real. In a mirror to the Abrahamic belief (god created man in his image) man creates Deity in his own image (with some extra stuff like a few extra pairs of arms)Can these behaviours be changed? Of course!! 'God takes the form the devotee imagine' is a very well established principle. So, it is perfectly possible to 're-imagine' the Deity at Sabarimala as a regular one who do not have this ascetic mode setting installed in. The problem is, how will you deploy this setting update to the crores of 'users' out there? Unfortunately there is no overlord Google/Microsoft/Apple/Linus Torwalds/ to do this effectively.Aaaand.. like many of the real life software updates, is it really needed, or would it be pushing the interest of someone?I have a 'Plan Z' in case things go really bad. Shhh... it is a secret weapon, to be used only under a zombie apocalypse type situation. No one who matter reads BRF, so the secret is safe here.1) Extract ('aavaahanam' in tantric term) the ascetic essence ('chaithanya' in tantricspeak) of the Diety, and install the same at the old tribal temple at Ponnambala medu, and forbid ALL visits there. This will satisfy the original wish as per the legend.2. Install the 'non ascetic' version of the lord at Sabarimala, and declare that now the restrictions are off.I think the mass can be convinced of it if the Tantri (not the accused Mohanaru or his young son. Everyone trust Rajeevaru) says ""I have no choice. I need to protect the Diety""Would people continue to visit Sabarimala in the new 'avatar'? I wouldn't, unless there is a motorable, clean and organized facility like Tirupati. I do the yearly penance and trek because of the belief in the legend (by my worldly side). My philosophical side do not need to go anywhere to interact with god."

True. The petition which was filed at Kerala HC, was filed by a person who had no locus standi (i.e non-Muslim), and he had no supporting evidence to justify his petition. Where as in Sabari Mala case, the petitioners were all Hindu women; who conveniently was represented by a Muslim lawyer. But now the women themselves have filed a petition, and we need to watch how that goes. But to be frank, I have serious doubts on the interpretation of ""secularism"" when it comes to Islamic belief systems.Whatever be the merits of the petition's arguments (it could be poor reporting as well), retd. judge Markandey Katju has this to say:Women’s Entry Into Mosques: Kerala High Court Approach Not In Conformity With Apex Court - Markandey Katju, Swarajya<snip>The reasons given by the Kerala High Court for dismissing the petition are as follows:The High Court observes “Averments in the writ petition do not suggest that the petitioner is a person who should ordinarily be concerned with the rituals and practices of the Islamic religion”.In other words, the petitioner lacks locus standi.The High Court also accused the petitioner of being motivated with a desire for cheap publicity.But if the Supreme Court did not dismiss the Sabarimala petition filed by the Indian Young Lawyers Association, who also did not have any personal grievance, on these grounds, should the Kerala High Court have done so?The High Court says that the petitioner “has not satisfactorily established his credentials as a person who has a history of espousing such causes before the superior courts of our country”.This is a novel invention of the High Court. Now, in order to make a public interest litigation petition maintainable, the petitioner must “establish his credentials as a person who has a history of espousing such causes before the superior courts”.In other words, he must be a ‘muqadmebaz’.The High Court says the petitioner does not represent Muslim women. But neither did the Indian Young Lawyers Association, which had moved the Sabarimala temple entry petition in the Supreme Court. The rule that the petitioner must be personally aggrieved to make his petition maintainable was discarded by the Supreme Court long ago in S P Gupta vs Union of India in 1982, followed by a series of decisions, e.g., Bandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union of India, People's Union of Democratic Rights vs Union of India, and the rule of locus standi has been changed since then. How could the High Court ignore all this?The High Court also said that “the writ petition does not disclose material that would suggest that there is an established practice whereby Muslim women are being denied entry into mosques”.But for that, the Court could have easily appointed an advocate commissioner to inspect mosques in the state and report on their practice. <snip>A lot of these protests are underpinned by the feeling of ""only our (Hindu) traditions are being interfered with"", and this feeling is growing among the Hindu middle class.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a fresh twist to the Sabarimala temple controversy, the Mala Araya tribal community will file a review petition against the Supreme Court verdict that allowed women of all ages to enter the hill shrine.The Mala Araya community is believed to have established the shrine, which was taken over by the Pandalam royal family and later by the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB).The Akhila Thiruvithamkoor Mala Araya Maha Sabha (ATMAMS) will file the petition through P N Vijayakumar, former district judge and chairman of the Kerala State Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.Sabha general secretary K K Gangadharan said the state government decision to not file a review petition against the SC verdict has disappointed community members.“Several rituals and customs of the temple, including the age bar, are part of tribal culture and traditions. They should not be altered,” he said. “The 41-day vruta or abstinence is part of the tribal culture. Women in our sect, as in most other tribal communities, would not visit temples during menstruation. The vruta and restrictions for women were part of our culture, which were approved by the Pandalam royals and the thantri.”I don't think it is a slam-dunk yet, because the SC will be told that it is no longer tribal territory, Twin Elephants own it, etc., but at least the MOHAWG is now on the side of the yindoo agitators.

And temple architecture is also very well defined.On the contrary I would argue that Buddhists made images of Buddha just as there were idols after the Mahayana split.And stupas were to house the relics of the Buddha. Similarly the Catholic church before the Reformation used to sell body parts of 'saints' or house them in Churches to attract pilgrims. Florence, Milan and Venice Museums have many such Christian relics.Temples never are defiled with dead body parts."

The government is duty-bound to implement the SC verdict,’’ he said. Vijayan also delved deep into the state’s tradition of reformation. “All social reformation initiatives faced resistance from orthodox elements of those periods. When women fought for their right to cover breasts, they had faced opposition. Social reformers Sree Narayana Gura and Ayyankali taught that certain traditions are meant to be violated. This state has undergone changes when Left parties and peasant organisations took that spirit of social reformation forward.’’True Indology on twitterThis is a myth.There was no Nangeli in history and there was never any breast-tax on ""lower"" caste women in Kerala.Kerala has tropical climate and in pre-modern Kerala many women including Brahmins did not cover their breasts. This ""breast-tax"" is a recently fabricated lieBefore advent of British Morals, most Pre Modern Kerala women of all castes freely went around toplessThis anti Hindu myth was fabricated to break Indian society, I challenge scroll(commie magazine) to show one contemporary reference to ""Nangeli"" or retract their liesmany commies and chrisislamic forces use this argument to blame Hindus all the time.Unfortunately many gullible hindus also succumb to this propaganda."

krisna,17 Oct 2018 6:28,"https://swarajyamag.com/politics/zero-marx-how-the-left-has-divorced-itself-from-its-core-hindu-vote-baseDon't think this was posted. This is the socio political ramifications of Sabaramalai issue. I have posted mostly the commie entrenched in kerala. many non kerlaites don't understand this phenomena as to how Hindus repeatedly vote commies despite anti HinduismHowever, the real problem with the Left in India is that it has an Abrahamic force, divorced from Indian, and especially Hindu, roots. And this despite the fact that it is the Hindu vote that has kept it in power in West Bengal, Tripura and Kerala so far. The Left has refused to acknowledge this reality, and its foot-soldiers in academic institutions have been anti-Hindu in their official posturing, whether it was in their rendering of Islamic history or in the kind of nonsense history they peddled on behalf of the Babri Masjid petitioners before the Allahabad High Court (read about the Left perfidy in the Babri case here). And now, they have done the same in the Sabarimala case.The Left is an anachronism and misfit in India largely because it chose to force-fit Indian realities in a hackneyed Marxist framework. Karl Marx wrote most of his speculations on India without coming within a thousand miles of the country, which meant that his information was based on the same distortions peddled by Western Indologists and others with similar prejudices. This is why scores of Indian regional parties, with far less intellectual heft than the Left, achieved political growth through their discovery of caste loyalties while the Left stuck to its class theory and came a cropper. Its academicians pontificated about empowering the underclass and wrote subaltern history, but when genuine subaltern classes came to power – Mayawati, Lalu Prasad, Narendra Modi – it did not discard its faulty lenses.Put simply, the Indian Left’s lenses are no different from the Abrahamic lenses of the West, for Marxism in the West is a logical extension of the universalisms created by Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In India, Marxism thus had no understanding of the essentially plural nature of Indian universalism.In the Abrahamic worldview, there are only binaries. My god or your god. My book and nothing else. My way or the highway. There are no spaces for nuances or the grey zone. Thus, Sabarimala has to be about equality of genders or anti-women discrimination, when there are words like differentiation and diversity that describe its practices better. If you want to fight gender battles in the temple, there are far better issues to fight for than the lone differentiated temple called Sabarimala. For example, why not fight for greater women priests or women discovering their Stree Shakti in temples dedicated to their empowerment?why do Hindus vote commies in 3 states of Tripura kerala and WBWhich still leaves us wondering why the Left even found some traction in the three states it has often ruled. Actually, the reason is so blindingly obvious that most people miss it. After Partition, the Congress took the minority vote, by promising protection to Muslims. This left Hindus with no alternative but to opt for the Left, which at least didn’t appear to be keen to appease minorities at the cost of Hindus. In Tripura, the Left grew on the base of the Hindus driven out of Islamist East Pakistan and Bangladesh. In Kerala, it is the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) which is a communal coalition, with Muslim, Christian and small community parties running the show. The Congress is the only one with some Hindu following.why muslims and Christians are safe wrt commies brain washingThe Left found Hindus, with their openness to agnostic and even atheist beliefs, more accepting of their ideology than Abrahamic groups like Christianity and Islam – and did not even figure this out for decades. In Abrahamic theology, there is place for only one god and that god is not Marx even if all these ideologies draw from the same well of binary universalism. If I am right, you are wrong.About KeralaIn Kerala, the Left arrogantly thought that the state’s high scores on human indices was its own progressive contribution, when the reality is that this differential preceded its rise to power, thanks to the enlightened attitudes of the local Hindu rulers and social movements led by Sree Narayana Guru, who emancipated the downtrodden Ezhavas. The Left simply took this constituency over, and pretended that the Hindu enlightenment that preceded them did not exist. Until the BJP started wooing the Ezhavas and the Nairs, the Left did not deign to honour Sree Narayana Guru or celebrate Hindu festivals with any degree of pride."

Sachin,17 Oct 2018 11:20,"As I type this in, two women (from Andhra Pradesh) are moving up from Pampa, the earlier point at which women were denied entry. They would have to trek for 5km to reach Sannidhanam area, and then climb up the 18 holy steps to reach the temple's sanctum sanctorum. From what I could make out the women did not seem to be carrying any of the holy/sacred items which devotees carry. At present the sanctum sanctorum is locked and no darshan would be possible. Update (11:15AM) - The lady Madhavi @ age 40 and her aged parents who were moving up to the Sannidhanam have now decided to come back after they realised what the protest was all about.Young woman enters Sabarimala; Returns due to protests.Three lady staff from the Devaswom Board was to attend a review meeting to be held at Sannidhanam. But the sentries at Pampa had asked for their age proofs and noted that they were above the age of 50. What is now being seen is that Kerala Police is now actually giving all support to women; so much so that it is now a prestige issue for them as well. Social media is clearly bringing up the antecedents of the Kerala women who are now planning to visit the shrine. Using their social media profiles itself, they have been seen abusing Lord Ayyappa, declare themselves as aetheists and also with pride that that they are communist cadres. Tomorrow would be a more decisive day as there are lots of ceremonies to happen (including the selection of the priests for this season).habal wrote:Sachin, IIRC you predicted police lathi charge like in ramlila maidan.Well perhaps I was not very clear.

habal,17 Oct 2018 11:33,"Sachin, thanks for your clarifications. It seems the communists are over eager to somehow make atleast a dozen women enter inside temple sanctum sanctorum. At the same time an open lathi charge would help state BJP to gain higher moral ground and claim that hindu rights were trampled.

Isn't that a 'self goal' ?Protests to be handled better by whom? I don't think all women were abused. The women who are coming to the place is coming with an agenda; and that is not devotion or love for Ayyappa. The latest is a woman from Pathanamthitta, whose own social media profile says that she is an aetheist and advides Ayyappa to take kadukka vellam (medical concoction) to control s-exual urges if any. And this woman today wears a black dress, wears a garland and decides to goto Sabari mala. From the Hindu devotees side, along with the current visible protests what should have got done was a campaign through Ayyappa temples all across South India. There itself the devotees had to be adviced that why women in certain age group do not visit the shrine. The Ayyappa Seva Sanghams across India, could have a done a better job in spreading their message across. But that would still not stop the fake devotees with an agenda from making a visit. The communists are hell bent on destorying a Hindu place of worship. Now the group led by the chief priests' & Pandalam royal family members have been arrested, all the while they were just chanting in Ayyappa mantras and were NOT involved in forcing any one from entering. And there is a ceremony planned for tomorrow, in which these two families have a major role to play. Will the communists force them to get involved in the ceremonies? Or get some ""commie priests"" (like in China) to take over the ceremonies? From what I can understand;1. The common Hindus have been able to clearly expose any new ""young woman Ayyappa devotee"" to be a fake case, using their own past information available in social media. So every believer is now realising the communist agenda better. 2. The communists (perhaps clearly aid and abetted by X'ian evangelical gangs) seems to be willing to adopt any tactic to some how break the traditions at Sabari Mala to show case this as a ""social reform"". 3. The communists also do NOT seem to understand the intricasies of the roles of the hereditary chief priest, the role (even though limited) of the royal family etc. If the devotee crowd's faith in these two groups are not broken in any way; they can actually use typical ""Gandhian"" actions like ""non-coperation movement"", by which the whole problem can be clearly pushed into the lap of communists. Even SNDP an organisation which looked pro-Govt, has now openly said that they are with the devotees."
Sachin,17 Oct 2018 21:29,"Sabari Mala round up..Section 144 to be imposed in Sabarimala on Thursday.Sabarimala Karma Samithi calls for hartal on Thursday; NDA voices support.Media bears brunt of protests as tempers soar around Sabarimala.Today's take away:-1. BJP and Congress have decided to support the devotees, but would not resort to violence. I heard a press briefing from R.S Surjewala of Congress, talking about giving rights to Kerala PCC to take the Sabari Mala issue as this was an issue have a very high impact at the local state level. 2. The main stream media, including the English ones all seems to be egging the government of Kerala to allow some woman to enter, and reprimanding them for not allowing the entry to happen today. 3. Cr.PC 144 is getting imposed in Sabari Mala and near by areas starting midnight today. With this police would get a clear way to send the pilgrims upto the holy shrine on the hill. Tomorrow, the priests of both Ayyapa shrine at Shabari Mala and that of the female goddess (Malikapurathamma) would be decided. The ceremony involves both the chief priest and the royal family. 4. The chief priest seems to have now made a firm U turn, stating that there is no way the temple can be closed. He did not have a clear answer when people asked what would he do when a young woman is actually visiting the shrine. ""We will see when it happens"", was his message. 5. Two women tried to visit the shrine today. One was a 40 year old lady from A.P, who decided to go back after she figured out what the protests were for. The second one was a ""pure fraud"". A woman who declared herself an aetheist (social media says she could be an X'ian) who then said she has become an Ayyapa devotee. When her own social media profiles were used against her, she changed her tune to say that she wanted to see the court order executed. The police then decided to offer her no protection.6. The state wide harthal tomorrow may only get a luke warm response. And other than the pilgrims themselves ensuring that they don't have any young women in their entourage, chances of young women making an entry is quite possible. Even in the past there has been repeated cases of young women from A.P who come to visit the shrine. I don't why this trend started, as it is known that only men make a visit to this temple. Till last year police used to detain such women at Pampa."

Many deracinated Hindus (the one Maculay stated while he founded the new education system - people in color Indian, in thoughts English, who hated their own culture and will gladly be slaves) are supporting it....

Because in any Hindu religious household mensturating women keep away from doing any ritual. And a religious Hindu generally have the ""faith"" to accept any unique restrictions in any Hindu temple which he/she visits. And do you also consider Sabari Mala temple as a public place like a bar or public toilet? Poor police preparation to sanitize the route. Looks like state police ia being slack on purpose. Can't sanitize a 5 km jungle trek and how are these people forming groups despite sec144 ??Which again makes me ask you this question . Are you a Hindu, who has ever been to Sabari Mala? The state police is not being slack on purpose, especially when being commanded by an over-zealous X'ian officer. Sec 144 Cr.PC was imposed in the area, but the District Collector also said that devotees would not be stopped. And from yesterday evening the devotees have started rushing in, and many are on their way. The district collector could have banned the entry of all devotees as well, result would be a good communal riot. Every Ayyappa devotee is coming up based on his faith & belief in the the temple (or else why even go there). So it will be tough for the police to stop the inflow of devotees, clear the trekking route, and then allow some woman to enter. I don't know if you have seen the crowd at Sabari Mala; in the peak season people literally stand for 8 hours in a queue. So Sec.144 Cr.PC, etc will have some limitations. Suhasini Raj says she is a devotee of ayyappa but has come here to cover the ocassion in her professional capacity.The biggest trouble makers in Kerala are now the news media and the police force currently deployed at Sabari Mala, commanded by a X'ian police officer. The court has upheld the right for Hindu women devotees, but that does not mean that any body can just walk in to a Hindu holy shrine. What next, enter the Golden Temple at Amritsar without head being covered, and then say ""come here to cover the ocassion in my professional capacity"".

Many of the major temples in Kerala were directly supervised by the Kings (of Cochin & Travancore). When their powers were given to a democratically elected government, the question came as to what would happen to these temples. That is when the Devaswom Boards came into existence. They also had to report to the High Court of Kerala (the judges have to be Hindus), and the board members are nominated by Hindu legislators of the Assembly. But the problem started when communists (who said they were aetheists) were also considered to be Hindus, and their votes also were counted . Because of all this the Devaswom Boards could not perform their real job; that is to be a supporting arm of the Hindus in protecting their faith & religion. The communist controlled Devaswom Boards have not even allowed opening of Ved Pathshalas in temple stating that it is spreading RSS ideology. There were many thoughtful decisions taken by the politicians of yore. Police stations which have big Hindu temples generally have their Inspector and Principal Sub-Inspector to be Hindus. In Sabari Mala also police men deployed for crowd control follow the same rituals/traditions which an Ayyappa devotee would follow. They are allowed to grow a beard, need not wear leather belts & peak caps, and generally remain barefoot. And they are called Police swamis. Now you can see all such practises getting stopped and ""secularism"" being set in."

Here are a few places that are excluded from a large segment of humanity:- Mt Kailas is voluntarily made off limits by international mountaineering community- Mecca's stone is not to be touched by non-muslims- Attukal Pongala is done only by women- Malabar's most powerful temple, the Parassanikadavu temple's pooja is done by Madayas who MUST be from a caste considered socially backwardAnyone can claim all these are breach of rights, just like that. But general idea is that all of them pass ""dont be evil"" test and hence everyone respects that, regardless of what law says. It is a continuation of the ""White Man's burden"" that makes a Dilli based legal team to couch it in ""Male vs Female rights"" and decided to civilize Sabarimala. I really hope the respected Mongol realizes that point. We should not fall for western universalism being happily thrust down our throats, be it this or jallikettu.

In this thread also we can see some rejoicing over that move. It is for sure that it is the main stream media in Kerala who is causing social unrest and disharmony. Isn't it funny that an innocent family including a woman, two oldies and two kids) show up casually, in the midst of the agitation and while the temple is closed. Some investigation into them is needed.Most likely this would be a ""police sponsored"" family, who unfortunately was used as guinea pigs. From what I could make out the family was clueless on Sabari mala and none of them were even wearing the mandatory black clothes, wore the beaded necklace etc. Even if they went up, they would not be able to go up via the holy 18 steps (even the man in the team), as he was not wearing the ritual dress etc. And then the temple was closed as well. From what I read, this family has NOT gone back from Pampa. The media is hoping that police would be able to persuade them to make a visit. Isn't it funny that a woman who is a declared atheist want to visit Sabarimala and shows up ALL ALONE at the district HQ, requesting protection?This has been the most obvious case that such judgements from the court would be misused by people. It has now come out that this woman (Libi) is a Christian. Her sister is a nun, now working in a different country. She was first an X'ian, then is said to have become atheist. And you should have heard how she said - ""I was an atheist till three years back, but now I am an Ayyappa devotee and believe in Thatwamasi & all that"". The way she said it was for sure that she was clueless on every thing. And her social media profile trapped her completely. She was abusing Lord Ayyappa. It was when all this was out in the open that the police had to ask her to get lost. In another interview she was heard saying she is now scared to go back home. Before that there was another woman from Kannur who said she was a ""god fearing communist"", who used to do the vruth every year. Again social media ditched her. People found from her Facebook profile that last year during the Mandala season she and her hubby comrade were happily eating non-veg food. One thing I don't understand. For making the visit to Sabari Mala people wear the beaded necklace (which is mandatory) with a Guru Swami (a senior person who have made multiple visits to the shrine). Now no sensible Guru Swami would help a young woman to start wearing the beaded necklace or fill up the Irumudi Kettu (a bundle, having mandatory items to be taken during the pilgrimage) etc. Then how are they saying they would visit the temple as a true devotee? But it is most certain that the verdict from Hon.SC has been taken as a ""license"" by very many groups in Kerala (and else where) to target the religious practises at the temple. The main motive is NOT devotion, but to cause harm to the religious feelings of Hindu community in Kerala. The main stream media and GoKL are the main abetters to this."

So yes, GoKL can try to mess up things by allowing women during a very lean period, where the men devotees would not be able to put a strong protest.

hnair,18 Oct 2018 19:54,"I dont think people who are asking for closure or not donating to Sabarimala is getting the true intention of both State and Central governments.1) If the Tantri decides to lock up the temple, the temple will be taken over by state govt in a jiffy and a new, pliable tantri appointed. Same as Dalai Llama vs Panchen Llama games. Courts will say no fundamental rights got trampled, since this is policy change and tantri is not a legal position.2) if no donation comes to Sabarimala, the large infra bill will be footed by govt, which again gives it more control than now3) Despite high hopes of many, current central govt has shown zero interest to local public's opinion in the matter of Sabarimala or for that matter, Padmanabha Swami Temple. Both wont be taken over by Center (a better solution than current state govt control), under the argument that both are live temples and not just national heritage sites.Forget successive Kerala governments, last decade has been challenging times for anyone who has faith in Delhi establishment to do the right things.

UlanBatori,19 Oct 2018 2:49,"All uber-faithfuls, nice going, but it is getting a bit tiring. I am sure the Supreme Court will be very impressed with your fatwas. (yawn)Yes, I knew the example from 1960s Southern US would cause a burr up the musharraf. It was used to show that the mindset if it can be called that, is pretty-much exactly the same. Enough perfectly faithful, religions, totally good people who preach Luv thy neighbor/his wife as thine own felt in the 1960s that they were TOTALLY right in not allowing riffraff into their schools, colleges, not to mention churches, restaurant, public restrooms, hospitals, until the SC ruled, and then the 82nd Airborne came in. The agitators then too were ""old women, children, church-going saints"" etc. PERFECTLY decent people. As recently as the 1990s I have been asked by Perfectly Fair Leaders why I supported the candidacy of (the best qualified applicants) for certain positions. What about defending ""Western Culture""? I asked them what they planned to do when the EEOC asked them what that was. You see Harvard today is trying to defend in court why they have been discriminating against people like us to protect their ""diversity"" and their ambience. Instead of going by merit. The bigots always have very impressive arguments. At the end of the day they are still what they are. The trick is to try and not get boxed into being that. By thinking of the rights of those whom you are screaming to deny rights. Maybe there are win-win solutions which Alla* won't allow you to see as long as you are yelling. I note that Jaitley took his time coming out with what is essentially a ""Miaow!"" instead of some good growling and teeth-baring due 3 weeks ago, so hold ur breath for Center to come to the rescue... That is because they cannot deny the essential inevitability of the SC judgement. Indian citizens have the right to enter public places, regardless of race, color, gender (yes, creed too but we won't go there yet). The case is that simple. Is it a public place? Then all are welcome. If it is not, well, who does it belong to? And why are they denying rights to citizens? They can be sued into destruction or tossed in jail. IOW, they can be banned from all public places. Yelling and screaming and being Offended on Internet forums does not change that fact one bit. If the SC judgement is dissed, those dissing it get dragged in for Contempt of Court. That is the law of the land. If it is to be overturned, Kerala must bring an Ordinance - which will be challenged as unconstitutional. Will Center bring an Ordinance? Sorry, I don't think so. Right now, it is win-win for BeeJayPee National to let the LDF face the curses, and lose the votes. Why should they bail the commies and their voters out? If it hasn't occurred to you, India is very much a North-dominated country. They are a bit afraid of the TN ppl because of the DMK/ history of riots. No such fear of Malloos any more than Northeasterners. Can Malloo yindoos turn this into another Vimochana Samaram? It must be evident even to the most asleep yindoo that they need to wake up and win the next election for Hindu interests, which cannot happen with CPI(M), CPI, Congress, Kerala Congress, Muslim League etc etc. It's not whether the CPI(M) is for or against present issue: it is that with CPI(M) running the govt, KL has no influence at all at Center. And KL yindoos have no influence at all anywhere even with a Hindootva govt at Center. (If this had been, say, Somnath, the High Court would have taken 65 years to render a verdict and the SC would be pondering for the next 100). Because they are afraid of riots. No such fear of Malloo yindoos rioting. Funny thing is, wimmens are not allowed anywhere NEAR the front 3 rows when certain Holies are present (I think this is true of the Akshardham gang's Big Cheese). But no one has sued yet. Wonder how they manage that: Guj wimmens are no less assertive than Malloo wimmens. Recently for an event in Khanstan, someone tried to invite said Big Cheese. They came in with above condition. My Evil 6th Coujin showed them single-finger pranaam and told them to go sit in their Boys Club treehouse. End of story. It would have been illegal just as in Sabarimala to impose any such conditions. If yindoo interests win the next election then they can mitigate the effects of the SC judgement with intelligent decisions. But face facts: Women between the ages of 10 and 50 will be allowed to go on pilgrimages to worship Shri A at SabariMala. They will have the right. Whether they choose to exercise it or not, depends on (a) fear of violent yahoos or (b) devotion and decency, a sense of history and ritual etc. I think (a) will just increase their determination and kill chances for (b). Not sure at all that (b) is better long-term for anyone."

Five companies of the PAC have been pressed into service here and a battalion of the Border Security Force (BSF) remains on the alert 6 km away. Some officials confided that there are at least 70 PAC and BSF companies waiting in reserve.The massive bandobust has a very good reason. The Supreme Court has ordered that if the long-standing dispute between Shias and Sunnis over two Sunni graves in an overwhelmingly Shia area is not amicably solved by April 27, the graves will have to be shifted. The court on March 21 permitted Suleman Sait, MP and president of the All-India Muslim League, to try and bring about a settlement by then.Many must be hoping he will succeed, for otherwise the consequences could be disastrous. ""We stand by our decision to commit mass suicide or resist the move by all means. No Sunni Muslim will allow this to happen,"" stormed Sunni leader Irfanul Haq Ansari of Doshipura. Many Sunnis consider the court order an anti-Islamic action. ""Nobody knows who will do what. Some will commit suicide and some will attack others,"" added another Sunni, Dr F. Kalam.Doshipura's Shia-Sunni dispute began in the nineteenth century (India Today, January 15) over a plot of land donated by the Maharaja of Benares for common religious use. The first case involving a dispute between the two sects was recorded in 1878 and similar disputes continued through the years.In October 1982 a Supreme Court-appointed committee reported that the Sunnis had vehemently opposed it but shifting the two graves seemed ""quite feasible"". It will not be until the graves are shifted as the court has finally ordered - or if an amicable agreement is reached by April 27 - that the matter will finally have been put to rest.However, as the administration prepared to execute the court order, Anjum Qadar, president of the All-India Shia Conference, came out with the plea that the graves should not be removed as doing so would set a bad precedent.Moreover, he said, neither of the two parties ever demanded shifting of the graves and it was the then commissioner who had created the problem. ""There are known instances of graves having been removed, but not under compulsion,"" he says.But 90-year-old Shia leader of Doshipura Iqbal Hussein accused Qadar of being a stooge of the Sunnis and said the demand for the removal of the graves was the main one. ""Anjum gave us Rs 3,000 in 1981 to fight the court case. Now when the court has given its final verdict he has changed his stand, and without consulting the Shias he issued the statement saying no Shia wanted shifting of the graveyard,"" he added."

In a first, the priests stopped their rituals and joined the protest.Oct 19, 2018 Ramesh Babu ThiruvananthapuramAmid high drama, two women – a journalist and an activist – were forced to return from within 500 metres of the Sabarimala temple Friday after its chief priest threatened to shut it down if they entered the shrine dedicated to Lord Ayyappa. (Follow live updates here)Prayer services in the temple were disrupted for the first time with priests boycotting rituals in protest.“It is a most painful day. I told everyone if women enter the holy steps. I will close temple and I will go back to my house. I am with devotees. I can’t be a part to violation of temple rituals,” Tantri (chief priest) Rajeevaru Kandarau told HT. There are 18 steps that lead to the temple’s sanctum sanctorum.After the threat of temple closure, police said the two women would be escorted back.“We have told the female devotees about the situation, they will now be going back. So we are pulling pack. They have decided to return,” inspector general of police S Sreejith“I have been forced to go back,” said Rehana Fathima, one of the two women.This is the second successive day that women were denied entry into the temple despite Supreme Court order after two other women including New York Times reporter Suhasini Raj were stopped on Thursday.As the situation turned grave with devotees and police locked in a tense standoff outside the temple at Sabarimala, protests also erupted in Kochi and Calicut.The two women – Kavitha Jakkal of Hyderabad based Mojo TV and Rehana Fatima – were stopped a short distance away from the Sabarimala temple. The government had earlier insisted that it would do all that is needed to ensure that women are allowed to offer prayers in line with a Supreme Court order.The government tried to allay fears of a crackdown against devotees opposing the entry of women saying it would not use force.Temple affairs minister Kadakampally Surendran also said devotees won’t be forcibly evicted and told the police to avert a showdown.“Police will not create any issue in Sabarimala and we don’t want a confrontation with you devotees. We are only following the law. I will be discussing with the higher authorities and brief them on the situation,” ANI quoted IGP Sreejith telling devotees.Police had landed in a quandary after activist Rehana Fathima refused to budge. She insisted that she undertook a 41-day fast and wanted to enter Sabarimala after the Supreme Court verdict of September 28 allowing women of all ages to enter the temple.Surendran pulled up the police for allowing Fathima to head for the temple which he said was a lapse.“People of all ages will be allowed to go there. But at the same time we won’t allow it to be a place where activists can come and showcase their power. It can’t be a place where they prove certain points of theirs,’’ Surendran said according to ANI.Tension soared in the morning with the erstwhile royal family of Pandalam, who are the custodians of the Sabarimala temple, asking the Tantri to close the doors of the shrine as two women headed for the temple under police protection. Protesters squatted on the path leading to the hilltop temple.The opposition Congress said the government was playing with fire. “The government is giving enough fuel to the Sangh Parivar,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. “It is committed to protect interest of devotees.”The state unit of the BJP which is backing the devotees also waded into the imbroglio, seeking action against police officials who “enacted a drama hurting religious feelings of devotees which led to disruption of temple rituals”.By noon, the day’s event took a communal turn over Fathima’s faith. K Surendran, general secretary of the BJP’s Kerala unit asked the Muslim community to desist from such moves.“It is a move against Hindus,” said Surendran.He also demanded action against the IGP after one of the two women was seen in police riot gear.“How was a woman was given police uniform? It is a violation of the Police Act. The government should take action IGP Sreejith for enacting a dirty drama,” Surendran said.Earlier, Kavitha and Fathima started their journey at 6.50 am amid heavy rain under police protection from Pambha, the base of the hilltop temple, police said.“The highest court has given the green signal. My trip is to uphold women’s rights” she said.But for Kaviitha and Fathima, Sabarimala remained a temple too far.First Published: Oct 19, 2018"

But still some forum members might be interested in the arcane aspects of law. The STC majority decision did label a bundle of Articles of the Constitution (25 to 30) as dealing with fundamental rights which includes the 'right to property'. However a subsequent ruling of the SC by a bigger number ruled that the 'right to property' is not a fundamental right. Unfortunately the lawyers arguing for continuation of a tradition did not stress adequately on the property rights of a juristic person. Because if we agree that the deity in Sabarimala is a juristic person he is entitled to own and enjoy property belonging to him.

I have no problems with Hindu's entering the temple.This is a place for worship and of believers and not meant for tourism. One cannot be selective in their belief and claim that I am not a Hindu but I am a devotee of Ayyappan. It is like saying ""slightly pregnant"" No one can be ""slightly pregnant"". either she is or she isn't. It has to be one or the other.It is a matter of the Hindu faith and the Hindu faith alone. There are approx two million or more Hindu temples in India. Of these, I understand that there are only less than 10 that restrict/do not allow entry of women and less than 12 that restrict/do not allow entry of men.There is absolutely no cause for ANY interference, from ANY quarter. No ones fundamental rights have been trampled upon.If it is Ayyappan darshan that they want, there is the Achankovil Sree Dharmasastha Temple near Travancore, where he is depicted in the form of a married man with two wives, Poorna and Pushkala, for example. All females are free to enter.There are also a many other Ayyappan temples where he is not in the naishtika brahmachari form. Females enter freely there too.If you are saying the deity in sabarimala is in the 'Naishtika Brahmachari' form (unfailing celibate), then the crude attempt to change the very nature of the deity itself is reprehensible and the so called ""activists"" have no business here.It was never about menstruation or impure women at all but it was ONLY about about fertility. BIF has purposely put out a motivated propaganda that it only was about menstruation or impure women.The Attukal Bhagavathy Temple in Kerala is one where males are not allowed. Do you see anyone making a noise about it??"

Government and Judiciary are involved because they screwed Hindus from British time by taking control of their worships.Any religious rules should be for and made by real practitioners/devotees only and in this case rule-making should be with Devotees, Pujaris, and temple owners (Royal family).Also, this is one temple where such Acharyam/Niyamam/rule exists and also no one does Mandala Deeksha for any other temple. All Ayyappa temples and Ayyappa shrines with in the other God/Godess temples are open to women. If there is discrimination, it has to be across the board to even consider it.

My parents took me to the shrine to perform my ‘choroonu’ (a baby’s first rice eating ceremony).I was later told that the group comprised my parents, maternal uncle and a Kani tribesman,” Nair told Express. Nair was born in November 1939 and the visit was sometime before next November as per the custom. He said his mother was in her youths during the visit. At present, entry of women in the 10-50 age group is banned at the shrine. First three children born to Nair’s parents had died as infants. “During that time people used to visit the royal family chief for spiritual advise. The chief advised my father to perform my ‘choroonu’ ritual at the shrine for my healthy life,” Nair said.His parents christened him T K Ayyappankutty Nair, in benevolence to Lord Ayyappa, presiding deity of the Sabarimala temple. 78-year-old Nair said he does not know the details of the visit. “Perhaps my mother entered the temple through the Malikappuram gate, avoiding the holy 18 steps reserved for those who observe the 41-day abstinence,” he says.If it is of any comfort to you Rahul Easwar has denied all these allegations from 1940s. https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/ ... iffer.htmlS. Chandrika, former Devaswom Commissioner, Travancore Devaswom Board, had in the same case told the court that the restriction is there only during Mandalam, Makaravilakku and Vishu. The court was also told that even while the old customs prevailed, women used to visit the temple though very rarely.

I am sure many of the bolis from Kochi area can even b00b recognize her, let alone face recognize.3. The lady is NOT converted to Yindoo ness.

If the SHO in charge of ""Sabarimala"" says ""Theyar is law and arder brablem hiyar"", it becomes so, and the problem stops right there. Anyone who show up requesting police protection can be adviced ""theyar is law and ardar brablem hiyar. Joo can't go onlee""Would they do that? Hell no!! They want to get poor ignorant Ayyappa 'wake up and smell the 'coffee'. All madarn and brogrejjive onlee.Allow me to narrate a quip that is not PC in mardarn age here. Xtians here take a 'lent' during the 50 days preceding the Easter celebration. On easter day, they attend the midnight church service, formally break the lent, and start eating meat etc. We yindoos make a funny story (because all the parties are comfortable here. we all can take a joke) that they carry the beef fry and a bottle of arrack to the church, and keep it outside. Right after the service, they formally break the lent by eating a piece of beef fry and drinking a gulp of arrack right at the church grounds.Maybe... just maybe... the govt is trying to give the same 'matter of convenience' to the poor Ayyappa devotees to break their pennance right after the darshan.

Unfortunately the lawyers arguing for continuation of a tradition did not stress adequately on the property rights of a juristic person. Because if we agree that the deity in Sabarimala is a juristic person he is entitled to own and enjoy property belonging to him. Such a ownership right includes prohibition of 'outsiders' trespassing into the property. If I own a house I can decide who can come in and who cannot. Denying the right to admission cannot be challenged on grounds of discrimination. Such a denial is just intrinsic to the notion of ownership rights.

So too the Pandalam royal family and the Head Priest of the temple are trustees acting on behalf the deity in exercising the rights of ownership of the property belonging to the deity.+1This is the correct way to see this situation irrespective of what one personally feels about women’s right to temples - which is not the issue here!In the case of SC/ST admission to temples - this juristic person’s rights were overlooked for social reform - albeit in that case no deity or scripture supports the denial of temple admission per se for said persons, and is therefore the correct way to interpret the same.If anything, it is my hope that more Hindus become aware of their own laws and mechanism that helps articulate their traditions and desires.No sane Hindu devotee, especially a woman, would break the age bar in place given the deity’s choice!It is the duty of every Hindu devotee to respect the rights and obligations that come with visiting a Diety of their choice."

No true devotee of Ayyappan will make attempts like these to climb the hill. These are feminists who want to prove a point. There’s a Trupti Desai in Maharashtra who has also vowed to come. I’m sure she won’t be allowed to set foot in Kerala,” he gloated. His friend just nodded.“Pinarayi may be an atheist. His party may be too. But what right do they have to foist their stand on Hindus and believers? Couldn’t the government have waited to implement the order after due consultations with the tantri family and the Pandalam royal family?” she said.“Since my childhood, I have gone around raising ‘Inquilab’ slogans on the streets. But not anymore. When it comes to Ayyappan, our faith comes first,” Manju said.But such strong statements only affirm that the widespread agitations centered around the hill shrine will have far-reaching ripples in the state’s political waters. The most significant crusade centered around the Hindu faith in the state in recent decades, the subject of allowing women of all ages in Sabarimala has fired up emotions among devout Hindus across classes like never before. The participation of women in large numbers at prayer meetings, and marches, in all corners of the state is a testament to how deep the issue has struck at the root of Hindu beliefs. Hindu women are the last vanguard of protecting the customs and traditions. If lakhs of Hindu women participated then it is a watershed movement in Hindu practices. It is afight to protect the traditions- amazing that the very Hidnu women are agreeing ""to wait"" to have Swami Ayappa darshan"" Show how the milaards are out of sync with ordinary Hindus. Judiciary is another bridge to cross to make it more Indianised and respect Indian traditions. It is fully of anglo-saxon types with total disdain for Hindu traditions. The government’s use of the police force in tackling protesters at Sabarimala and Nilakkal has not gone down very well.From WikipediaSabarimala is the 2nd largest seasonal pilgrimage after mecca drawing nearly 20 million yearly devotees with utmost respect with braving lot of hardship. Here no caste or division matters-only what matters is intense devotion to Swami Ayappa. A playground for conversions-- pathanamthitta has the highest money given by Christian NGOs for conversions and damaging Hindu traditions."

I happened to talk to a number of friends/relatives of the saffron kind here, who are visibly uncomfortable, since the policy driven from the 'north' is to swallow this bitter pill for the better good, while their own self and the local aam-swamy folk want them to be fiercely behind the movement.In essence, it is the aam-swamy, who keeps his belief above the party affiliations, and the party folk, who keeps the party line above the belief and forced to do a taqquiyya on the ground here. The aam-swamy will have more important problems like job, family etc soon enough. So, this show is going to ebb this mandala season itself, and the commies (short term) and saffrons (long term) would win. I already seen a number of aam-swamys continuing their trek nonchalantly, right next to the 'surgical strike party' with the 'activitists'."

And this after they'd been waiting for a hearing for this side for more than a year whole the SC glibly banned the practise last year? The eerie silence from all the bjp leaders, CMs and RSS even going ahead yo saying they welcome the verdict shows how hollow their strategic level thinking is, or the lack of such.

The same bjp was and is adamant for women entry in Shani Shingnapur temple in maharashtra. This is consistent with their stand in center. Same fiasco and protest happened in maharashtra albeit not this scale. BJP stood behind judiciary as if both are wink wink together on this. In KL they are not going to fool anyone. They simply cannot take contrasting stand on exact same issue in two different states and think they can fool people. Same with Congress. Commies are at least openly bigots. But other political parties are acting too smart on this. First support the verdict, then when after seeing the ground reality change the stand for political mileage but never try to make law to avoid attack on hindus in the only land they can claim on earth."

During the time right after Independence, getting cases filed against oneself, and getting beaten and thrown in jail, would have been tickets to fame and riches as a politician in the next election for those who wanted that. But today it just brings ruin. I still don't see the slightest sign of any constructive (meaning effective in furthering yindoo causes) strategy evident from yindoo netaship. Did the festivities in Maharashtra lead to any positive changes (other than all Hindus being allowed access to worship in a Hindu temple)? Plus supporting the CNN/NYT thesis that Hindus are violent yahoos who beat up law-abiding citizens? The advice of the celluloid Gen. Patton is worth noting: No (innocent love-child) ever won a war by Dying For His Country. He won it by making the other (innocent love-child) die for His Country.All these claims of commies proclaiming distress and disgust do not translate to votes at the next election, because there the exhortation will be to vote CPM/Muslim League to defeat the Communal Monsters and the Corrupt Monsters (Modi and Raoul). Face it: SC **MAY** entertain a Review Petishun based on a finding that Malloos can riot. Or it may not. The costs are very high either way to find out. Note that the commies/moomoos are in control of the Police: they will gleefully use any rioting to (a) kill/main as many young yindoo netas as possible(b) destroy credibility of as many senior/old yindoo netas as possible and put them in jail(c) loot as many temples as possible(d) loot as many wealthy yindoos as possible citing support for terrorism. Rah-rah Devotion sounds great while one is suffering from Admiration Complex inside a mob, but...What will the ""devotees"" have gained, 1 year from now? Other than celebrating bringing in Commie-Paki rule for the next 5 years? If you stop Hindu wimmens from praying at the abode of Rsa Sabari this year, a case will be filed next year.

The eerie silence from all the bjp leaders, CMs and RSS even going ahead yo saying they welcome the verdict shows how hollow their strategic level thinking is, or the lack of such. We've seen enough from Javdekar already by his bleatings in not touching the Constitution or RTE. These are fundamental tenets that they are not ready to fight n show Delhi-Statesmanitis.

Tens of thousands of peoples are trapped in various parts of the state without food,water or medicine for the last 3 days.

himanshu,19 Oct 2018 19:17,"As Kerala battles its worst flood in nearly a century, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the state has suffered an estimated loss of around Rs 19,512 crore as per the initial assessment. Admitting that the path to recovery can be long and arduous, the chief minister has urged all to contribute generously to the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund. Nearly 200 have lost their lives in the fresh onslaught of rain and floods since August 8. After taking stock of the situation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a grant of Rs 500 crore, aside from the Rs 100 crore declared by Home Minister Rajnath Singh last week. Apart from the PM Relief fund and Vijayan personally donating Rs 1 lakh to the CMRDF, various ministers of state, officials, celebrities and people from various walks of life have contributed money to provide relief to the flood-ravaged state. Navy spokesperson also re-tweeted a video of Rajkumar's heroic landing. Rajkumar and his men showed exemplary valour during the Ochki cyclone storm, when they took midnight sorties to rescue trapped fishermen ignoring choppy seas. For this work, Rajkumar was awarded the Shaurya Chakra. As the flood situation continued to remain appalling all across Kerala, Indian Navy deployed 18 more teams at various locations on Friday to augment the rescue operations in the state. Southern Naval Command had deployed a total of 58 rescue and diving teams with Gemini boats in multiple location but seeing the worsening situation, 18 more teams have been pressed into service. Navy is also readying 25 more rescue teams with boats for deployment on request of state government with fresh incessant rain alerts. On Friday, a total 310 people have been rescued by the boats and 176 by aircraft. ""Till date, more than 3,000 people have been rescued by the Southern Naval Command and continuous efforts are on to bring the flood affected people to safety and also provide them essential relief supplies such as food and water,"" said a Navy statement. Air rescue has been carried out at various places of the three badly affected districts; namely, Thrissur, Ernakulam and Pathanamthitta. Various aircraft including ALH, Sea King, Chetak and MI 17 (of IAF) were able to rescue more than 176 people till now. Food was airdropped on the roof tops of various houses and churches till now. A total of 50 air sorties amounting to 80 hours have been flown."
rising sun,19 Oct 2018 19:17,"Brave men of Indian security forces are trying their best to rescue trapped people in Kerala which is reeling under unprecedented flood. One such officer is Captain P Rajkumar (Shaurya Chakra) of Indian Navy, who managed to save 26 people in a single sortie on Friday. He showed great skills to land the Seaking 42B chopper on a narrow rooftop. According to Indian Navy, "" Yesterday Captain P Rajkumar Shaurya Chakra winched up 26 people from a SeaKing 42B helicopter, in extremely challenging conditions hovering between trees and in the limits of man and machine"". Yup. We can land just about anywhere. That's a @indiannavy Seaking 42B on a narrow rooftop evacuating people in #KeralaFlood The story gets even more amazing.

himanshu,20 Oct 2018 19:17,"Why do you care about some random comments? Such trash are on both sides, need to keep in check fake news too. Twitter is also divided among left vs right maybe bcuz elections are near. Tell me what Kerala gov has done since May 29? How come so many people died, no disaster management plan or what?"
volcano,20 Oct 2018 19:17,"Scums can be very attention seeking, they make sure that we notice what they say. Yeah, there are fake news, no doubts. Monsoon is not something that is new to Kerala. Things were not that bad until August 13th. There was some flood before that, but it was in regions that see flooding occasionally during monsoon. Casualties until that point was not high, mostly due to landslides. No one seems to expected it to deteriorate like this.,I certainly didn't.It was the heaviest rain in a century,hard to expect that. Things got bad on August 14th-15, that's when regions where never flooding happen started flooding. Everyone started waking up from that point. I am volunteering from 15th onwards and government is doing what they can from that point onwards.most of the efforts are coming from the people's. Food, men, money, everything came from people's. Goverment provided organisation and structure to effort, but people's did everything. Central government didn't took the flood seriously either until August 16th. On August 15th center goverment dispatched only 10 columns of NDRF and 8 columns of Army, compared to the 95 columns they dispatched during uttarakhand flood or 85 columns during Kashmir flood.Most of the rescue was done by the brave fishermans, They went inland with hundreds of boats and saved tens of thousands. I cannot thank them enough. In August 16th central goverment dispatched another 20 more columns of Army, and by the time they got here, it was 18th morning and shit was real. Navy and air force did what they can and rescued many people's from critically affected area. But you can only rescue few hundreds via air, real rescue came though water and fishermans and local volunteers saved 90% of people's. We never had a disaster of this magnitude, hopefully we will learn from this and will be more vigilant next time."

guynextdoor,21 Oct 2018 19:17,it is because states like Kerala have been paying a disproportionately higher share of taxes that you have an army to start with. You thik the low level illiterate and starving masses of the central heartland can pay for the 50 Billion the IA gets every year?
superkaif,21 Oct 2018 19:17,Thats your choice and you are entitled to it. My perspective is this is a massive tragedy where ultimately people have been left with just the clothes on their back.

screambowl,21 Oct 2018 19:17,"What good will gesture. UAE is aware that if Keralites go for leave or start moving back to help the family temporarily, the loss to UAE would be in billions.

guynextdoor,21 Oct 2018 19:17,No- like illiterate Bhajpa supporters they should sit unemployed and survive on hot air alone.

screambowl,21 Oct 2018 19:17,In uttarakhand there were 5000 deaths and what Kerala government paid as relief fund. Rs0. But Uttarakhand paid Kerala Rs5crore. keralites should have big heart!
screambowl,21 Oct 2018 19:17,The same hindi heartlanders from ITBP and army are now pulling Keralites out from gutters they have fallen into. Arrogance looks good but this is a lesson you people have learnt. Even Manipur and Assam have paid Kerala rs3crore and rs 2 crore respectively.
guynextdoor,21 Oct 2018 19:17,Yeah...and the kerala soldiers and officers in the army.An army that states like Kerala have funded and kept because you hungry illterate buffoons can't. Taking bath and brushing teeth everyday continues to be a major problem for heartlanders because you spend money on Gau Ahdhaar.

himanshu,21 Oct 2018 19:17,"Ecologist Madhav Gadgil, founder of the Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, said “Irresponsible environmental policy is to be blamed for the recent floods and landslides in Kerala. Extensive stone quarrying and mushrooming of high-rises as part of tourism, and illegal forest land acquisition by private parties are the major reasons for the recent floods in the state. We had first submitted the report in 2011...we were in a sense boycotted by government officials as we had recommended them to stop illegal activities."" Gadgil said that the report had very specifically pointed that if the stone quarrying was not stopped, it might eventually lead to natural calamities “like the one happening in the state today”. However, the establishments turned a deaf ear to the recommendations. According to Gadgil, a total of 1,650 excavators were deployed for stone quarrying and mining, of which only 150 were given permissions. Expressing grief over the situation in Kerala, Gadgil said, “The government should at least now stop all the illegal stone quarrying activities after having faced the consequences. Although it is late, the government must act on the recommendations ...”"

volcano,21 Oct 2018 19:17,"First of all the chart is wrong. There is no 920 crore central government relief allowance to Kerala for this flood. The central government relief provided for this flood is 500 crore. 320 crore is released from 'State Disaster Relief Fund' which is an annual fixed amount provided to every states,made of annual deposits by central government and corresponding state government for any disaster relief in that year. 500 crore special relief from central government + 320 crore from State Disaster Relief Fund (released in two steps, 100 crore in august 13+220 crore in august 16th). that 100 crore is already included in the 320 crore State Disaster Relief Fund. Whoever made this chart is comparing different relief funds. Central government relief +SDRF annual state allocation (Kerala) +non existent 100 crore VS Central Government relief (Uttarakhand)"
himanshu,21 Oct 2018 19:17,"The point is BJP controlled states & other states under PM Modi has provided more assistance to Kerala than UPA did for Uttrakhand, still Keralites blaming centre for injustice or something."
rising sun,21 Oct 2018 19:17,"To meet the Kerosene demands in the state, Modi government has now provided 9,300 kilolitres of kerosene to the flood-ravaged Kerala. The government will also provide 12,000 kilolitres of kerosene. Modi government on Sunday further informed that the LPG bottling plant in Kochi has also been reopened. Meanwhile, according to the government data, more than 38,000 people rescued and evacuated from the flood-affected areas in Kerala. Medical aid has been provided to over 23,000 people. 3,00,000 food packets have been supplied by the Food Processing Ministry. The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) today directed the central ministries to focus on providing essential commodities and medicine and restoration of vital services in flood-hit Kerala. The NCMC, headed by Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha, in its review meeting directed that focus should now be on provision of emergency supplies of food, water, medicines and restoration of essential services such as power, fuel, telecom and transport links as flood water recedes in Kerala. The Department of Food and Public Distribution has made available 50,000 metric tonnes of food grains (rice and wheat) to meet the immediate requirements with additional quantities in the pipeline, an official spokesperson said. The Department of Consumer Affairs has made arrangements to airlift 100 metric tonnes of pulses by tomorrow with additional quantities to be sent by train. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry has made available 9,300 kilolitres of kerosene to Kerala. Additional 12,000 kilolitres of kerosene will be allocated. LPG bottling plant in Kochi has been reopened. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is airlifting 60 tonnes of emergency medicines on Monday. It has put six specialised medical teams on standby. The Railways will provide blankets and bedsheets to meet the immediate requirements of the state government. The Air India has offered to airlift relief material without any cost. The NCMC, which met for the fourth consecutive day, reviewed the rescue and relief operations among the armed forces, NDRF, Ministry of Home Affairs and other central ministries and the Kerala government. Rescue and relief operations are continuing in full swing with the thousands of personnel of the Indian Navy, Air Force, Army, NDRF and CAPFs are engaged in the rescue, relief and evacuation operations in Kerala with the support of dozens of helicopters, aircrafts, hundreds of motorboats, the spokesperson said.

The operations will continue till the situation becomes normal.

So far, they have rescued and evacuated more than 38,000 people from the flood-affected areas. Medical aid has been provided to more than 23,000 people. As many as 3,00,000 food packets have been supplied by the Food Processing Ministry.

The Railways are running two special trains tomorrow to Kolkata from Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam to ensure travel of stranded people.

Train services are expected to be restored on all lines by tomorrow evening.

A special train with 14,00,000 litres of water and a Navy ship with 8,00,000 litres of water will reach Kerala by tomorrow.

Commercial flights will start operating from Kochi naval base from tomorrow and all logistic arrangements for this have been put in place.

The regular NCMC meetings are taking place following the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who made an aerial survey of the floods affected areas yesterday."

screambowl,21 Oct 2018 19:17,Not equivalent to what happened last year in North East.
rick,21 Oct 2018 19:17,"Listen, no one here requested you for your family funds. It is the right of every integral state in India to expect assistance when faced with such a calamity. There should be some perk of being a part of the country yea? I don't even understand what you are trying to prove here? It is a fact that a foreign nation offered more financial assistance to Kerala than the very central government that collects taxes from Kerala. The fact that another state recieved more or less assistance is irrelevant, the country has an obligation to assist every state. And every sane human is expected to help out or be quiet if he has nothing productive to offer. You are only portraying a negative impression by being less understanding of others problems. It is normal for anyone in distress to feel upset/disappointed in these situations even when they are getting the best help. The best assistance people like you could possibly do is to shut up. Because there is a growing number of foreigners who are actually wondering how several people like you from the same country can be so insensitive about the disaster your fellow citizens are facing. P.S: I didn't exactly call you an asshole but I appreciate your higher understanding of your personality to take up the name."
volcano,21 Oct 2018 19:17,"Well, what i see when I look into that chart is an attempt to mislead public. I see someone comparing Central special assistance (1000 crore) by UPA government for Uttarakhand where tottal economic loss to state valued at 12,000 crore vs Central special assistance (500 crore) + State Annual Disaster Relief Fund + non existant 100 crore when total economic loss is valued at 22,000 crore .Which is misleading comparison. So in conclusion, 500 crore center releif by BJP to Kerala, total loss 22,000 crore. 1000 crore center relief by UPA to Uttarakhand when total loss was 12,000 crore. And yes, the central goveremnt under Modi is not proving enough help to the Kerala state and that is injustice to the peoples of Kerala."
volcano,21 Oct 2018 19:17,"We do intents to use the state money for rebuilding, just like every other states do when they have a disaster. And why do we demand center fund? Because the center government collect taxes from our state,60% of entire tax Keralites pay goes to center government to be exact. We are not asking your family money dear screambowl, central government money is not something that came out of blue, its something we payed to the government, we have one of the highest tax percapita among the Indian states."
screambowl,21 Oct 2018 19:17,"Stop talking big, Kerala never donated any money when there were floods in NE and also In Uttarakhand. And why should we pay you more when it is not required.

You want to waste national treasury? And you are not the only one who pays taxes. There are 28 more states. My state has already given 3-5 crores to you. Other side when my state was in trouble your state did not donate.. now you SHUT UP! And have sense of integritiy with this nation with different languages. Foreigners also noticed that this is same Kerala which never donates for national cause and then argues we are paying tax so no need to donate.

Yes we are there to help you with first aid, medicines and other stuff you need at the moment but state has to bear the loss. Luckily the deaths have been controlled. In North East it's common, no one cares about it. add 10 crores each from, Rajasthan, Andhra, Gujarat, Wb, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, MP, 25 crore from Telangana... 15 from UP. total = 500 crore + another 200 crore. More over, deaths in UK flood was 5000+ here the magnitude is low. The aid was given as first aid. Even soldiers died and helis crashed. That was the devestation. It has also had effects in UP Delhi and Haryana. It was a national disaster in a comparative low GDP state"
himanshu,21 Oct 2018 19:17,"In Uttrakhand we lost 5500+ people while around 300 in Kerala but its all about the money in the end. I agree with @screambowl Kerala has shown it is selfish and greedy state. They themselves don't believe in equality with people of other states, don't support them when in need but expect full support in return."
volcano,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"I have no intention in trying to down play the disaster in Uttrakhand and I have never done it. You are the one who came up with a BJP propaganda chart (which is nothing but absolute Bullshit) and tried to downplay the issues in Kerala. I just shown why it is a bullshit chart and for some reason, you cannot handle that. I do not consider any one of us as above anyone else. Its the central government that is treating Kerala state less than equal and showing political discrimination in a time of disaster."

I don't see anyone asking you for assistance or sympathy. And you are in no position to dictate that a state can't be upset with the assistance from the central government. But let me do the internet a favour and avoid bandwidth talking to someone like you. It's more productive talking to a wall. No one here is complaining about the help from other states, so half your whinning about Kerala not helping is irrelevant anyway. Again, sorry I even bothered to talk to you, please get back to whatever crap you are better at doing."
himanshu,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"Bro i understood your point after first reply. The chart highlights money, centre/state gov role, life lost etc but then again you pointed only money just to blame centre."
himanshu,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"So, it's tax payers money and I have right to question. Why are you getting paranoid. And As you have nothing left to say, you have started abusing and getting anxious when you got nailed."
volcano,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"I am glad that you understood the point. Well, on the other hand, that chart intentionally excluded the monumental loss, faked the central allowance part to almost double. That chart is a cheep attempt by the BJP supporters to down play the genuine criticism against in-sufficient response by the central government. I never compared Kerala flood with any other disaster, I just want to show why that chart is bullshit."
volcano,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"Well, I just got some more time to dig up on that chart from BJP media cell. 1) According to chart, center gave Kerala 920 crore == Wrong, center gave Kerala 500 crore. (320 crore is from annual state disaster relief fund). 2)According to the chart, UPA government gave Uttrakhand 1,000 crore. That is not true. UPA government gave 7,346 crore for flood relief in Uttarakhand. Also, according to BJP media cell chart, no central assistance for dead peoples, injured peoples or property loss in uttarakhand. In reality,Rs 5 lakh each has been given to the families of missing or dead persons in Uttarakhand, Rs. 50,000 is given for for the mules that were dead,Compensation also be given for commercial buildings. Since they gave compensation of dead mules, I am pretty sure that center gave compensation for injured peoples as well."
bali,22 Oct 2018 19:17,Central government has already released 600 crores. What exactly is your intention of repeating 500 crores again and again?? Aren't you misleading by quoting wrong figures??
volcano,22 Oct 2018 19:17,That media report is wrong. They are quoting the 500 crore from modi + 100 crore released by Rajnath singh. That 100 crore is actually released from the annual 'State disaster relief fund' which is a fund of state and center government released to every states every year.
bali,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"Let me show you how you are pulling down your numbers. Uttarakhand flood happened in mid June 2013 and this news came up in Sept 2013. BTW it's just approval by group of ministers, not even by cabinet. Uttarakhand to get Rs 6,687cr aid - Times of India. Let me highlight some points from the news. 1. He said the Uttarakhand government will get a loan of Rs 3000 crore from Asian Development Bank and World Bank as externly-Aided Project out of a total of Rs 6687 crore financial assistance. 2. Rs 1187 crore will released for the National Disaster Response Force. 3. Rs1500 crore from centrally-aided projects. 4. Kumar said UPA government has so far released Rs 390 crore while another amount of Rs 250 crore will be released soon. And all these after 2 and half months after the devastating flood and here you want the center to write a check of 22000 crores within a week !!! Wow!! What a sense of entitlement!! The way you have been ranting for last 3 pages, you perfectly fit the profile of a congitard or commitard. Chose whatever you prefer. After all the effort of NDRF, Army, Navy, volunteers from opposite ideologies, you still feel betrayed, then go cry a river. Nobody gives a damn. Before you tell me to shut up, let me remind you it's a public forum and I do have equal rights to answer to your bullshit as much as you, if not more."

volcano,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"He said 90% of the loan will be repaid by Central government and 10% by state government. i am sure you seen that as well. Cental goverment took lionshare of the loan commitment. Completely true. UPA government further released funds (total of 7,346 crore) after one month on December 11th. Except that you won't hear me saying so. The point I made is simple, the 'Thank you Modiji' chart comparing Kerala flood and uttarakhand flood from UPA times, made by BJP media cell is absolute bullshit, and misleading. Either way, I am not a bhakat scum. You are delusional to think if i expect anything from YOU. As i said earlier, we don't count on Bhakats for anything, never had, and never will. About NDRF and Army, 1st of all, i appreciate whatever help army and NDRF did for the peoples, I am sure they did whatever they can. After all its a national institution that is serving the country selflessly long before Bhakat scums even had a political party. Peoples of Kerala came out of trouble not because of Army or NDRF, most of the rescue is done by fisherman and local volunteers with their 600 boats. when flood hits the state, central government dispatched just 13 columns of NDRF and 8 columns of Army to the state compared to 95 columns for uttrakhand and 85 column for Kashmir. Each column have 70 peoples, that's 560 armyman and 900 NDRF with less than 30 fiber boats for an entire state with millions of peoples isolated in flood. In many places, there wasn't even a single army or NDRF personal until rescue is over. Navy and Air force had a grant total of 16 helicopters deployed for rescue, they rescued few hundred peoples every day, nothing more. Most of the peoples are rescued by local volunteers. Center atlast sent 20 more columns of army on Aug 16th and they reached disaster regions by 18th when most of rescue was over. Don't be worried, you are a good boy, I won't say any such things."
bharat,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"If a country gives you more aid than what your own country gives, you would feel. Dear Keralites: Various other states’ chief ministers have announced monetary relief for flood-hit Kerala from their respective chief minister relief fund. Neighbouring Tamil Nadu (Rs 10 crore) and Andhra Pradesh (Rs 10 crore), Puducherry (Rs 1 crore), Jharkhand (Rs 5 crore), Maharashtra (Rs 20 crore), Gujarat (Rs 10 crore), Punjab (Rs 10 crore), Telangana (Rs 25 crore), Bihar (Rs 10 crore), Himachal Pradesh (Rs 5 crore), Uttarakhand (Rs 5 crore), Chattisgarh (Rs 3 crore) Madhya Pradesh (Rs 10 crore), Karnataka (Rs 10 crore), West Bengal (Rs 10 crore), Manipur (Rs 2 crore) and Tripura (Rs 1 crore) announced as part of donation.
from: Kerala floods donation: This is how much the state has received so far Almost all the states in the above list are lower than you in many HDI indicators, are poorer than you in average wealth. Yet, they have paid from their meager earnings to help tide over a brother state. how would you feel - when a poor brother is helping a richer brother in need, but the rich brother complains it is not enough and wants to go outside the family for more money? Can you at least take a moment to take the pride in your own folk, who have in their own capacities, tried to share their earning to help you during times of crises? Can you take a moment to feel that pride - in your middle class country that wants to live by its own means and not go ask for aid. I am sure you would feel that pride in you when you take a hit - fall down - and you would say ""I have my family to pull me back up - I dont need others help"". This is the time to see how every state is coming together to help. Manipur, tripura included. this is a time to see how every indian feels the need to be with kerala."
nair,22 Oct 2018 19:17,Quite an interesting thread....
bali,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"True, so far you have acted like a pure scum !! Again feel free to choose your pedigree. Go through your own posts again and try understanding what are you ranting so far rather than attempting to twist facts. As I said nobody gives a flying f$%k what you want or don't want. And when the whole state is submerged, you gathered all these info!! Bravo!! Are you sure you are a human being?? You appear to be some kind of super hero, unless you are simply propagating Commie propaganda!!"
butter chicken,22 Oct 2018 19:17,People all over India have donated for Kerala floods.How much did Kerala donate for Uttarakhand floods?(which was a worse disaster in comparison)
screambowl,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"Their intention is to collect as much money as they can to restart their business and build churches. I mean other states face such calamities multiples times no one shows this kind of attitude. Already a 110 Billion GDP and 3 crore population, still they need money. Where as Uttarakhand is 40 Billion dollar GDP which faced massive floods and land slides. And these people have objection to that. Money is not the solution to flood relief it's the availability of medicines, food, cloths and shelter which is being provided by the army. It's the first aid. Nation is ready to send medical help and other sort of relief stuff but why money? There were few Keralites who said help is their right because they employ lots of north Indians. This is their attitude."
superkaif,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"Whats interesting about it? Please expand? I see a sad situation. This thread speaks volumes for certain mindset. A huge tragedy is taking place and people are attempting to bring personal agendas to the table. I frankly am not looking at this from a religious, state or them and us situation. I see, as usual in a crisis, the poor suffering the most. I think to go on about state support, who did what when and how in previous disasters is inconsequential and not needed at the moment and perhaps policy has to be looked at a later stage but to bring ""tit for tat"" situation up now is immature unnecessary and not helpful. IMO Indians need to put their heads together and put their grievances behind and feed those that haven't eaten for the last couple of nights."
ranadd,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"""India"" at its best in this thread."
screambowl,22 Oct 2018 19:17,Stop spreading the propaganda. Every state has donated something and will continue to do so. But the attitude of Keralites' is well noticed! Point is about partiality with other states.
volcano,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"Nothing is worse than a Bharat scum. I just did, here is the list of my posts #40,#49,#50,#54,#59,#61,#64, I only see me trying to explain why that chart is bullshit and misleading.Twisting facts is not my trait and BJP media cell definitly excelled in that in that art, as long as the reader is an illiterate who cannot double check their propaganda. I am not the one who posted BJP media cell chart comparing 2 disasters, which is nothing but twisting facts and misleading public, with color pattern for political parties in this thread, with a sole intention to score some political points. Chart simply almost doubled center help to Kerala under BJP and reduced UPA help to Uttarakand by about 87% from 7346 core to 1000 core. I simply called out that bullshit and some cannot handle that. No body cares. Then shut the *censored* up, click ignore and move on. Ohh yes, I did, since I am not a stupid who gets his information from Bhakat Media cell. I was a person in the ground volunteering in the relief camp and we have 5 media channels reporting about the flood live 24 hours for the whole week. We know exactly how many NDRF and Army is in the state, when and where, that's what medias do, they report,in detail."
superkaif,22 Oct 2018 19:17,What propaganda am i spreading? Look at the thread title - look at the suffering yet instead of discussing this and how Kerala is overcoming this natural disaster - look at the stance and tone you are taking. Now calm down no need to shout and stop reading too much into what i have posted. There is no hidden ulterior motive in what i post.
volcano,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"You don't see a single Keralaite objecting the help central government provided to the Uttaraghat flood unlike the Bhakat scum like you who want the central government not to provide much needed assistance to Kerala. If anything, I am simply happy that the UPA government provided a generous assistance to the peoples of Uttaraghat. About Kerala being a state with 110 billion economy and 3 core peoples, I think you should be happy about it. We are 110 billion economy simply because we managed a little bit better and elected people's who are not bigots and less corrupt. After all 60% of the entire tax a Keralite pay will go to the central government, which is good for you, so just chill and be happy. Money is not the entire solution to a flood situation, but it is a big part of the solution. 1 Million peoples are in relief camps and they don't have much left to go back. Homes are destroyed, agriculture in the entire state is destroyed, livestock distroyed,business establishments and livelihood is distroyed. Medicines and food alone will not cut it. Medicines and food are important in rescue stage but money is important in the next stage, re-inhabitation. That is the reason why UPA provided 7346 core to Uttaraghat, for re-inhabitation."
volcano,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"Oops,ist not a Bharat scum, its a Bhakat scum. Damn autocorrect."
screambowl,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"They did not object or grant because they have nothing to do with Uttaranchal. For them Uttaranchal is a foreign country. Same for NE. You would get assistance but first what you have got kindly manage that properly, if the situation calls for more then it can be sent. But with 110 GDP you wouldn't require much of the assistance. Relax! The risk is always about the accessibility to stranded people, but IAF is deployed and doing well. First care about the Life then other things."
screambowl,22 Oct 2018 19:17,Rebuilding the state is their own job with little assitance from centre for a 110 b dollar economy. Worry about saving people's life first not their businesses.
nair,22 Oct 2018 19:17,Well I am a keralite... and has the personal experience of a flood refugee.....Several friends are affected in this flood..... So my posts would be very partial and emotional ..... So I will stay from this.....
rising sun,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"Sanjiv Bhatt, a former police officer, misrepresented an old image as having been taken during the floods in Kerala, and used it to accuse Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ""viscerally"" hating the state. The picture shows men repairing wires on electricity poles. ""Kerala State Electricity Board workers trying to restore power even while facing heavy rains. This photograph was taken 5 days ago. Now you know why Modi and his Sanghi Thugs viscerally hate Kerala,"" Bhatt said in a tweet. India Today's Viral Test team did a Google search for the image -- and it turns out that Mathrubhumi, a Malayalam newspaper, used it in an article published in October 2016. That story was about Urjadyut, a Kerala electricity board project. In fact, the image has also been used in other articles related to the board. As well, our Kerala correspondent told us the picture has been around for some time. Kerala has been devastated by monsoon floods; over 350 people have died, and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) says the potential damage is worth Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 crore. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's Office has said the state police have been asked to take strict action against people spreading fake news on social media."
rising sun,22 Oct 2018 19:17,"Much before the NDRF, the Army, the Navy and the Coast Guard were deployed in Kerala’s sinking villages and towns, the locals, realising the ferociousness of the floodwaters, banded together to save their own. People went from house-to-house, whistling and shouting, knocking on doors in the dead of night to tell their neighbours, friends and family that it was not safe to remain at home. Those who lived in low-lying areas, in close proximity to water sources, were quick to spot the danger, grabbing essential clothes and important documents, to run out of their homes. Others, who had the luxury of upper floors, waited on nervously for hours before finally paying heed to their villagers’ pleas. They had the more ominous rescue stories to tell, escaping in a tottering fishing boat or canoe as it danced left and right in the raging currents of the river. Together, the villagers who probably didn’t even know each other’s names, stuck their necks out for each other, showing remarkable courage in the face of adversity. At several relief camps across the state, such stories can be heard. The valour that the central rescue teams and the military showed in plucking thousands out of swelling waters is undisputed, but way before they arrived on the scene, the people of the state had shown the inclination to look out for one another. “It’s sad that we needed a tragedy of this magnitude for us to come together. I had never realised that we had so much unity among ourselves,” says Dhanesh, whose double-storey home in Varapuzha in Ernakulam district was engulfed by floodwaters. “It’s true that I wouldn’t be alive if not for my villagers,” he adds. Similarly, in Manjaly, a village adjoining Varapuzha, Rajeshwari, 52, spoke of how her family were ferried in cars to a higher area by helpful locals and panchayat officials. If not for a vehicle, Rajeshwari, who has a slipped disc, says she would have found it extremely arduous to wade through the flooded waters. Several flood survivors indianexpress.com spoke to, stated how the village as a community, in the absence of television news channels (power was disrupted) or updates from the government, relied simply on the speed of the rise of water level and the geography of the area to gauge the danger. Families with the elderly, the handicapped, the women and the children were the first to leave, followed shortly by the men. In several villages, temples, churches, and mosques became rallying centres for evacuation as their influence was believed to be stronger. “There’s a bridge here in Manjali that goes over the Periyar river. On the other side live mostly poor Hindus belonging to SC/OBC castes. On this side, it’s mostly Muslims. When the floods came, people helped out one another rising over religious lines. So in a way, the bridge became a bridge of peace and communal harmony,” remarks Dr Mohammad Rafique, a homeopath at the local relief camp. The most heartwarming scenes can be seen at the hundreds of schools, colleges, marriage halls and auditoriums that turned into temporary settlement camps for those escaping the floods. Families sat in close huddles, discussing the condition of their homes, the things they lost and strategising on the way forward. They compared each others’ homes, looking at photographs on their cell-phones and debating which one was worse. At a camp in Kanjoor, P Ashokan, a standing committee member in charge of health at the local panchayat, takes the microphone to give helpful directions for the inmates. “After registration, don’t forget to get your kits from the front desk. All essential supplies like toothpaste-toothbrush, mats and blankets will be distributed after lunch. Women can rest in the classrooms on top. At 4 pm, don’t forget to come to the auditorium for tea,” he says into the microphone. The doctor at the Manjaly relief camp attested to the same. “The other day, I was very happy to see two men, who belong to two ideologically-opposite communal outfits, helping with a large vessel to boil rice,” Dr Rafique said smiling. At yet another high school-turned-camp in Elamakkara near Kochi, Gireesh, a BJP area committee president, and ward members of the CPM worked together in arranging food and distributing them to the inmates. Otherwise, with knives out at each others’ throats, they left politics aside to ensure everyone got fed. Kerala’s panchayati raj system and the extraordinary influence its local bodies have in solving the problems of the people are known to many. In fact, when disasters like floods or the Nipah virus outbreak are reported, the first round of action always revolves around the local panchayats and the municipalities. In many cases, the first responders are always connected to these local power-centres, extolling the bottom-up approach. In the case of the floods too, preliminary reports and interviews with inmates at the shelter camps indicate a strong bond that the people have with the local bodies. For example, the panchayat president’s or the ward member’s contact number would be on the phones of many of the village residents. When calamity strikes, they know who to call. In the first couple of days, officials told the indianexpress.com that they had to rely entirely on the donations of private individuals and organisations for food and other supplies. In those days, cooked food were brought in to feed the people. However, with rain not abating, panchayat officials took steps to open ration shops for rice, sugar and other essential commodities. Vegetables were also sourced from the local markets. In the school’s kitchens, where midday meals are cooked, scores of men and woman sat around cutting vegetables and preparing food. They worked in shifts so that no one works continuously. Food timings were charted and strictly adhered to. Morning tea (both black and with milk) at 6 am, followed by breakfast at 8, lunch at 1, tea and snacks at 4 and dinner at 8. For infants and old people, there was hot milk and eggs. By 10 pm, everyone would retire to the classrooms, men and women sleeping separately. Indianexpress.com was hardpressed to find someone unhappy with the scheme of things at relief camps. “They (panchayat officials) are trying to do their best. We must understand that and adjust accordingly,” a man at the Kanjoor camp said."
volcano,23 Oct 2018 19:17,"Ohh Yeah, So your objection to Kerala flood assistance must be due to your overwhelming love for Keralites. Whether we have 110 Billion USD economy is not is not really Important . We have a 110 GDP because we breed less, worked hard, elected peoples who is a little bit less corrupt ,bigot and castist. Central governments duty to Kerala is not just collecting tax from Keralites, If we do not need center for rebuilding even after the heaviest flood in a century, why the *censored* do we need central government to begin with? Why should we pay 60% of our entire tax to central goverment?Just to suck up our hard earned money, so that cows in UP can have an adhar card?"
bali,23 Oct 2018 19:17,"Since you are not capable of analyzing simple facts, let me repeat them again. The so called ""UPA help"" which includes 1500 crores for center aided schemes and another 1187 crores for disaster response force, were released months after Uttarakhand flood. And you are comparing that so called ""HELP"" with central government aid released within days of Kerala flood ?? Instead of repeating ""Bhakat scum"" like a broken record, work a bit on your analytical skills and come up with some logical argument. If some BJP supporters increased the central aid by few hundred crores, you were shamelessly quoting a lesser number again and again. Your posts are precisely as crap as any of the on line trolls. Kid, you need to learn some manners first. You are nobody to tell me what I should do or not. You started this shit show and you are going to get the response in the same manner. Ok. So you were on ground and got you info from 5 channels, 24 hrs !! Wow. I am sure those channel must be certified by the chief commitard or may be the great Pappu himself !! Next time you spread your third grade commie propaganda, come up with a better explanation about your source. Given your analytical ability, there is not much hope. But you can give it a try."
seiko,23 Oct 2018 19:17,"A simple wikipedia search can debunk this argument.. We have provided 20 million rupees to Utrakhand and also govt employees all over Kerala donated their one day salary for the flood victims, apart from the pvt contributions.. then again who cares about the thruth.. its always about bashing the state right?"
seiko,23 Oct 2018 19:17,The funny thing is that its not the mullahs or evengelists who asked for the suffering of the people but the so called followers of sanathan dharm.. So much for riding the high horse
seiko,23 Oct 2018 19:17,"Kerala has faced the wrath of monsoon fury over the past week. This was in fact the biggest natural calamity since 1924. The unprecedented rain and floods has so far taken away 357 lives and shook several Malayalis who were gearing up for the local harvest festival-Onam. A disaster is always a disaster and has great sorrow and distress attributed to it. But alongside this 'worst flood in a century' has also made us to think and introspect into what we have been doing for some time now. This article is all about ten positive takeaways from this disaster. 1. The State Government led by the Chief Minister was there right throughout the rescue operations. They were seen on the ground administrating the mission even at the worst hit places. Kerala, profoundly known for its political diversity, ensured that political differences never hampered the rescue and relief measures. Could be the first time in the history of Kerala Politics, both ruling and opposition parties kept their political differences apart and came together to provide all assistance to the affected. The Kerala Police, Fire Force, District Administrations and the Forest Departments did their best to minimise the loss. 2. Although the Meteorological Department's prediction was not spot on, our National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) swung into action in no time. The 58 teams of NDRF saved lives of thousands in their biggest-ever relief and rescue operation in the country till date. In total 43,000 people have been rescued and over 12.47 lakh people are lodged in rescue camps. 3. Our defence forces-Army, Navy and Air Force along with the Coast Guard pitched in time. Under the directions and guidance from the State Government, ‘Operation Madad’ as this mission was called, carried out stupendous rescue operations right across Kerala. This to a large extend saved several people marooned in areas like Chengannur, Paravur and Chalakudy. As I write they have now focused their mission in the northern parts of the State. Equally happy to note that the families of these defence personnel too supported by assisting in relief camps and opening community kitchens. 4. With the Cochin International Airport (CIAL) forced to shut and flights cancelled or diverted, Kochi was almost detached from the rest of the state. To worsen things road and rail connectivity were also affected. It was a timely decision by the DCGA to open up the old airport on the Willingdon Island for commercial passenger flights to operate. This move by the Civil Aviation Ministry eased the tension as operators like Air India, Jet Airways and Indigo decided to land their planes on a runway that was shut for commercial operations 18 years back. Kochi Metro Rail stunned us by offering free rides especially during those days when the National Highway was submerged and the satellite town Aluva was getting isolated. It helped volunteers to provide relief materials to people stranded there. 5. There were many unsung heroes who left everything to engage fully in the rescue operations. The first in the list is the fishermen community,now popular as coastal warriors. It was not so long since they braved the Okhi cyclone and were done with the trawling ban and these brave souls took everyone by surprise. When they realised that it will take some time for the defence forces to assume charge, they did not think twice to pool in money, loaded their boats onto trailers and reached the flood hit areas in no time. These warriors never waited for any permission/orders, completed their mission and left without any complaints. Government acknowledged their support by offering them money and they embarrassed all of us by politely returning it as their contribution to CMDRF. This is definitely going to be a case study for our disaster management forces. Yes, saviours need not always come in uniforms. 6. Volunteers especially youngsters rose up to the occasion to organise and coordinate one of the biggest rescue and relief measures the State had ever witnessed. Post rescue was critical and crucial as many of the rescued are patients, in desperate need of medicines. Arranging food and essentials including clothing was taken up by these youngsters- popularly tagged as ‘freakens’ on priority and our good Samaritans continue to put in their best to make it happen. Taurus trucks and off-roading vehicles took the flooded roads and they simply did magic. The Sikh community got together and cooked meals for the stranded. We should appreciate all these people who went beyond their way to help those in need. Taking the words of Thiruvananthapuram District Collector Dr.Vasuki IAS, these guys actually created history. 7. ‘Crowd funding’ is not a new term but it is definitely something new for Kerala. Rs.20,000cr is the loss estimated so far and this is not a small figure. Irrespective of age, caste or location many people in and outside Kerala continue to generously contribute to the Chief Ministers’ Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF). Apart from the PM Relief fund of Rs,600cr and CM himself personally donating Rs.1 lakh, the Vice President, other State and its Ministers, Supreme Court Judges, Officials and other celebrities have also contributed money to provide relief to the flood-ravaged state. There were instances where kids, who saved their pennies for long term goals, inspired us through their donations. Obviously they do not have to save tax. In addition, many good souls made their contribution through medicines and relief materials for the needy. The second home to Malayalees, UAE alone has promised Rs.700cr and they even went out of the way to mobilise additional donations within their circle. In addition payment gateways like Paytm created dedicated buttons for contributions and as now its flowing. 8. Social media, particularly Facebook and Watsapp played its part to effectively network and coordinate among the volunteers. Several times these platforms were operating like control rooms and the techie community supported well for its smooth functioning. Telecom Providers did their part by providing uninterrupted network coverage. They also gave away free data and talk-time so that people stranded can be in touch with the rescuers.All these helped for incessant ground level coordination. Remember they did this amidst their fight for existence.
9. Corporate Companies supported the mission by offering free medicines and medical aid, relief materials. Certain companies in Kochi even went to the extent of opening up their office spaces for families of employees, who got inundated due to floods. They also announced holidays so that their other employees can take part in the relief works. Certain companies credited salaries early and are also offering interest free loans for rehabilitation. Private Hospitals opened up their gates to admit and treat victims for free and are today actively providing all assistance through relief camps. 10. Finally the social harmony exhibited by each Malayalee in these tough times is heartening and worth mentioning. Many lended their roof to those rendered homeless by the deluge. Several schools and religious places were turned into relief camps and they continue to be. Thus we showed the world humanity matters the most. Kerala floods will go down in the pages of Indian history not as a natural calamity but as days when humanity triumphed disaster. The Chennai flood was indeed a learning for us, in terms of reacting to flood situations. This flood is neither the first nor will be the last instance of extreme weather. The only way out is mitigation but questions like 'who' and ‘how’ continue to challenge us. As Indians, as Malayalees, it was an opportunity for all of us to rise above our petty differences and arm ourselves with the resolve that “yes we can”.The road ahead is even more challenging and let us together rebuild Kerala."
seiko,23 Oct 2018 19:17,Have you ever seen the ground reality ? Why are u acting like a sore looser.. we dnt want your money. No body forced you to donate.. even the prostitute donation of 25000 have more worth than whatever money u have.. Most of the people have nothing left to go back to. Most of their life long incomes were gone for ever.. God knows how many years will take to rebuild their lives..And you are *censored*ing about 110 GDP.. Hope you nevrr went through a calamity like this.. I was in constant fear about my family for the last 2-3 weeks.. All of my relatives home were under water.. there were no place to go.. all were stuck in their own places and couldnt help each other.. Have you ever face such a situation? The sense of helplessness is too much to bear.. And you are making a mockery about it.. I have lots of thing comes to my mind to say to you.. You dont wanna help dats fine.. but dont make a blank statement that we are fine without having an idea about the ground realities.
screambowl,23 Oct 2018 19:17,"Kerala flood is not an isolated event. We have had more devastating calamities in the past and there also people suffered and have had a lot of loss. No one is blaming keralites but your government. And coming to helping eachother, every state has sent some amount and the total of210 crore. How much Kerala government has paid in the past or donated when nation wanted somewhere else. Yes I know what floods are, 45000 villages were effected uring Uttarakhand floods, 21000 villlages suffered during Assam flood. And both states had 40 billion dollar gdp and 20 billion dollar gdp respectively. How did they manage? Why can't Kerala manage with bloody 110 dollar GDP? Are you nuts or what?"
screambowl,23 Oct 2018 19:17,What tax are you paying to the government? Half of the population is in Gulf and rest control by CPI which has no concept of setting up industries. Just earning money from Gulf and saving in banks.
seiko,23 Oct 2018 19:17,"Show me some links where Kerala govt shyed away from helping other states? Even govt and pvt players from Kerala helped as much as dey can when other states were in trouble..just because some netizens says otherwisw doesnt make it the truth.. We have lost assets worth 20000 crore including agriculture, shelters, their incomes, certificates.. you think anyone can recover from this that easily..And about govt.. I never been a fan of communist, spacially Pinarayi.. but whst he have done is an exceptional job.. the co ordination between govt, army and volunteers were exceptional.. you have no clue how the rescue efforts functioned like a well oiled machine. You only saw a non bjp govt in pwer and spew venom.. You have no idea about the massive help Uthrakand recieved after the flood? Look it up and whats with 110 billion GDP? Dude the state's 12 of 14 districts were under water.. it washed away peoples lifes savings and land .. are you that blind to see it? Peoples lifes were changed for ever..tel how we gonna manage it? Even if they go back to what is left, do you knw how much moneybit wil take to rebuild everything.. dont make silly statements after reading the so called twitter experts post.."
seiko,23 Oct 2018 19:17,"Are you just thick or what? You dont think we pay taxes ?? And its not CPI, its CPM.. you dnt even know the basic difference and still behave like an expert about Kerala"
rick,23 Oct 2018 19:17,"Please save your time and energy. You can't educate the ignorant. Fortunately they represent only a minority in this country, so its irrelevant to make a point with such people. Its not like they can contribute positively to anything anyway."
rising sun,23 Oct 2018 19:17,"Politicians of all hues and the Christian church have sworn to oppose the proposed decision of the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to implement the report of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), headed by environmentalist Madhav Gadgil. MoEF's move followed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) fixing November 12 as the deadline for the MoEF to clarify its position on accepting the WGEEP report. NGT's deadline came on October 8, after its orders passed in April to implement the NGEEP within three weeks went unheeded. The Kerala State Government, which sought the Supreme Court's stay on the implementation of NGT's directive, received a snub on October 8 when the apex court dismissed its petition on the same day. The NGEEP report envisages declaration of 37 per cent of the Ghats as 'Ecologically Fragile'. Following this, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy has called an emergency all-party meeting to formulate the state's response to MoEF's move. The Opposition Left Democratic Front has called a hartal in Idukki district - located in the Western Ghats - to protest. Pointing out that the environment and ecology of the Western Ghats were under serious threat from human interference, the WGEEP had called for a spate of strict measures intended to protect the ranges, classified as a world heritage site by the United Nations. But an all-party meeting in Kerala and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) government held last year asked the central government to reject the report. The Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, the state's largest church which accounts for the maximum number of farmers living in villages located in Western Ghats, too has strongly opposed the report. Both the Congress and the CPI(M) issued specific statements rubbishing the WGEEP report, saying it did not consider the livelihood issues of thousands of people who lived there. ""We will physically beat back anyone who comes to our area to implement this report"" threatened PC George, MLA and chief whip of the ruling Congress-led United Democratic Front government. An all party meeting had earlier asked the central government not to implement the report. ""The report will completely stall the state's development in the name of conservation"" said the committee. The most serious objection raised by the parties was regarding the classification of ecologically fragile zones, where strict regulations were sought by the Gadgil committee on habitation and development. The Committee directed the State and Central Government not to issue environmental clearance to any project coming in the Ecologically Sensitive Zone 1 and 2. Following similar objections from the governments and political parties of all the six states that share the Western Ghats, MoEF had constituted a high level Working Group, headed by space scientist G. Kasturirangan, to examine them. However, the Kasturirangan Committee generally endorsed the Gadgil report, suggesting only minor changes regarding the zonal classification. Gadgil had opposed Kasturirangan's changes too, saying they too may harm the extremely fragile Ghats which could ill afford even minor interference. In July, the NGT had held that the states were statutorily obliged to protect the environment and ecology of Western Ghats. This was based on a petition by Goa Foundation, a NGO seeking orders to be issued to MoEF to implement the NGEEP report. In response the Kerala State Government filed an affidavit in which it contended that the tribunal could not issue any directions as the report was under MoEF's consideration. The CPI(M) criticized the report saying its implementation would stall all the proposed power projects in the state which woiuld lead to a severe power crisis in Kerala. CPI(M) was particularly miffed by the WGEEP's objections to the proposed Athirappalli Hydroelectric project. The Syro Malabar church even suggested an international conspiracy behind the WGEEP. ""If the report is implemented thousands of people living in at least 100 villages would lose their livelihood for they all fall in the so called ecologically most fragile zone according to WGEEP"" said a church spokesperson."

In a nation everyone has a role. They are dependent and not piggy bagging other. Now cut on your sanctimonious speech."
volcano,24 Oct 2018 19:17,"My analysis is something that political propagandalists like yourself fear.Since I am not a slave of any political party and an iilliterate I won't buy propaganda bullshit. I am not the one who started comparing two tragedies that this nation suffered score some political points. One of our fellow former posted a typical ""Thank you modiji"" BJP propaganda chart here to score some political points. The chart was absolute bullshit, politically motivated, with fake statistics and colour theme for different political parties. All I said is that this chart is bullshit!! It really is. I quoted all my posts and it increased BJP Support to Kerala(Until this point) by about 40% and reduced The UPA support by 87% from 7346 core to 1,000 crore. And as @Seiko pointed out earlier, Kerala did provided economical assistance to Uttarakhat and yes, the chart says otherwise. That is simple political propaganda, it's aim is political exploitation of a tragedy and that's disgusting. Central goverment aid to Kerala is not final, I know it very well. Nationsl disaster relief funds will be released only after evaluation,I know that very well and I never said otherwise. One thing I disagree is the chart from BJP media cell and it's what you call inventing statistics. About the Bhakat scums, they definitely are nothing but scums. Spitting all their hate,bigotry and fake news all over the Internet in a time of disaster. I do feel bored by repeating that word to describe them , but alternatives that came to my mind like cow piss drinkers or bull dick suckers soundss too offensive,so ,I will stick with the Bhakat scums."
