Rakshaks should post the latest news, lessons that India can learn from disaster management (what went right, what went wrong) and the effect of this disaster on international and Japanese economy.The Steel containment of Reactor no 2 seems to have been damaged. This is a serious issue.Japan Faces Prospect of Nuclear Catastrophe as Workers Leave PlantJapan faced the likelihood of a catastrophic nuclear accident Tuesday morning, as an explosion at the most crippled of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station damaged its crucial steel containment structure, emergency workers were withdrawn from the plant, and much larger emissions of radioactive materials appeared imminent."

5,Singha,15 Mar 2011 11:05 ,"the yellow matter officially hitting the fan...APJapanese ordered indoors in radiation leak crisis(AP) – 22 minutes agoSOMA, Japan (AP) — High levels of radiation leaked from a crippled nuclear plant in tsunami-ravaged northeastern Japan after a third reactor was rocked by an explosion Tuesday and a fourth caught fire in a dramatic escalation of the 4-day-old catastrophe. The government warned 140,000 people nearby to stay indoors to avoid exposure.Tokyo also reported slightly elevated radiation levels, but officials said the increase was too small to threaten the 39 million people in and around the capital, about 170 miles (270 kilometers) away.In a nationally televised statement, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said radiation has spread from four reactors of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant in Fukushima state, one of the hardest-hit in Friday's 9.0-magnitude earthquake and the ensuing tsunami that has killed more than 10,000 people, plunged millions into misery and pummeled the world's third-largest economy.Officials just south of Fukushima reported up to 100 times the normal levels of radiation Tuesday morning, Kyodo News agency reported. While those figures are worrying if there is prolonged exposure, they are far from fatal.Kan and other officials warned there is danger of more leaks and told people living within 19 miles (30 kilometers) of the Fukushima Dai-ichi complex to stay indoors to avoid the possibility of radiation sickness.""Please do not go outside. Please stay indoors. Please close windows and make your homes airtight,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told residents in the danger zone. ""Don't turn on ventilators. Please hang your laundry indoors.""""These are figures that potentially affect health. There is no mistake about that,"" he said."
6,Purush,15 Mar 2011 13:00 ,"Now we have self-styled 'experts' expertly inserting their feet in their mouth...  http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/new ... 708194.cmsMUMBAI: Top officials of the Department of Atomic Energy today said India's civil nuclear programme will continue without any compromise on safety parameters, and claimed what happened in Japan's Fukushima plant in wake of the deadly earthquake was not a ""nuclear accident"". ""Safety is the overriding parameter and DAE cannot take any shortcut and Indian plants are safe but after analysing the situation in the nuclear reactors of Fukushima, which have been affected due to an unprecedented Tsunami preceded by high magnitude earthquake, we will revisit the safety aspects of our plants,"" top DAE officials said. ""There is no nuclear accident or incident in Japan's Fukushima plants. It is a well planned emergency preparedness programme which the nuclear operators of the Tokyo Electric Power Company are carrying out to contain the residual heat after the plants had an automatic shutdown following a major earthquake,"" said S K Jain, the Chairman and Managing Director of Nuclear Power Corporation.  (WTF is this guy smoking?)Once the plant shuts down after an emergency situation automatically, the fission reaction stops and it is only the residual heat that has to be quenched and that is what the Japanese were doing, Chairman of Atomic Energy Commission, Dr Srikumar Banerjee said. ""Because of the unprecedented Tsunami, the external power was unavailable for the emergency diesel generators to take over... during the process the pressure was building up in the reactor which had to be released in a phased manner, that resulted in the exothermic reaction due to hydrogen generation. ""It was purely a chemical reaction and not a nuclear emergency as described by some section of media,""   Banerjee said."
7,vina,15 Mar 2011 13:04 ,"My respect for the Japanese as a society went up many fold. The true character comes out only in adversity. My word, what a disciplined and highly civilized people. No looting, no untoward breast beating, no emotion charged bleating, all disciplined, orderly and everything and trying to best address a calamity of this magnitude as best as anyone possibly can.Very few societies can behave this way. Consider Unkil, Katrina hammers New Orleans and we have utter chaos and lotting and breakdown of civil society.  If this happens in China, there will  be absolute rioting and turmoil (ever see Chinese try getting into a bus, it is worse than anything you see in India) and absolute chaos. In India there are reports that the Tsunami warning buoys set up by the Govt after the 2004 Tsunami have been ripped apart by fishermen for the metal and the materials. I guess it would be only poetic justice if those fisherfolks are wiped out in a future Tsunami.A Japan like society will bounce back to even greater heights after something like a tragedy of this proportions. I would bet on it. They did it before , after WWII and the nukes at Hiroshima and Nagasaki."

While he is right in the sense that it is not a ""nuclear failure"" technically and the explosions were hydrogen generated when steam reacted with the fuel cladding, this is a classic Loss of Coolant Accident and a failure of safety systems and backups, directly leading to a nuclear incident. Maybe unlike Chernobyl maybe, but an accident where there has been release of radiactivity all the same!"

25,shiv,15 Mar 2011 20:22 ,"I have a question. reports say that the Boron control rods to stop the reactor were inserted as soon as the earthquake occurred, but even after this there is a lot of residual heat which needs to be cooled.Is this residual heat merely the high temps that were achieved initially and stored heat or is there a residual reaction that gives off heat that continues for a while after the boron rods are inserted? I am surprised at the amount of water needed for cooling even after the reactor is ""shut down""Clearly the Hydrogen explosion and Cesium detected means that the Zircalloy tubes have been breached by temperatures going above 1200 deg C. And this AFTER the Boron rods were inserted  What gives? I understand that nobody knows yet - but can anyone throw some gyan?"
26,Lalmohan,15 Mar 2011 20:31 ,"shivji, please to read the tech analysis cited in the indo-japan threadall is explained"
27,Anujan,15 Mar 2011 20:32 ,"Basically control rods are neutron absorbers. So they stop fission in Uranium (which requires a neutron capture to fission). However, radioactive byproducs in the fuel can fission spontaneously (without the need for neutrons). This radioactive decay is what generates heat (3%-6% of peak heat). So the core has to be cooled till the byproducts decay and disappear. This can take a few days and requires water circulation."
28,Suppiah,15 Mar 2011 20:46 ,Does that mean over a period of few days the problem will sort itself out naturally provided the vessel and outer containment holds until then and they manage to keep some cooling partly if not wholly with seawater?
29,Amber G.,15 Mar 2011 20:49 ,"^^^ Shivji - I have a few posts (in other threads) which may answer your questions.The 'residual heat' is wrong term, it is decay heat.. even if fission stops completely there is  some heat generated by radioactive fission products. (14 Mev vs 200 mev per fission in the beginning ) for the particular reactor  the heat produced will be about 0.2% (of the full power heat - which is still quite large) even after a week. (I have posted this before)('spontaneousness fission' for that kind of fuel is completely negligible.)"
30,shiv,15 Mar 2011 20:58 ,OK. Question answered! Thanks for the pointers and replies folks  
31,vina,15 Mar 2011 21:04 ,"Suppiah wrote:Does that mean over a period of few days the problem will sort itself out naturally provided the vessel and outer containment holds until then and they manage to keep some cooling partly if not wholly with seawater?It is physically impossible to contain that kind of heat without cooling. Take for instance a 1000 MW Thermal reactor which has been working for more than 100hrs. At a emergency shutdown, the residual heat output will be in the order of 6 to 7% (per articles I see) , and that is a WHOPPING 70MW of HEAT. Now , that amount of heat, no structure can contain for too long without active cooling and it needs massive amount if it. The good thing is that that decay heat drops off exponentially and will be less than 1% or so by the end of 3 days and and keeps dropping faster and faster and it can be stored in a pool like most spent rods are kept without requiring massive amounts of cooling.That is the reason why if you look at the AHWR Thorium reactor design, there is no need for a pump, the heat removal and cooling is purely by convection alone, and there is large water tank on top of the reactor with boron in the water , so that the reactor core can be doused in water and is designed to be fine for 3 days without any intervention in the event of an emergency shutdown.The problem is that Fukushima reactors are 40+ year old Gen 1 designs that had severe problems that came to the fore only when Three Mile and Chernobyl kind of things happened. As always, in engineering, you learn from experiences. A kid can learn how to build a bridge in a Civil engg course and do fine. But that course itself is the result of couple of hundred years of learning by trial and error and serious accidents and failures and refinement that came from building those bridges. The Physics is probably easy , once nailed, the engineering part is another thing that goes through it's iterative loops.In the latest Gen 3 , 3+ and Gen 4 reactors, much of this are addressed and the emphasis is on passive safety, unlike the Gen 1 and Gen 2 designs."

According to the story, they have a list of volunteers within TEPCO willing to go on-site with HAZMAT gear to try and work on separating fuel elements. TEPCO is reportedly refusing to accept volunteers under the age of 50, or who have small children as dependents. The reason for this is that the risk of developing cancer as a result of this kind of work is extremely high. We cannot confirm these rumors, but we encourage major media with resources on the ground to verify this if they can.We call to mind the words of George Patton in 1947: “All men are frightened.

To enter the ctmt bldg there are small man access doors in addition to the main large door/hatch.And if you take them out they will melt due to decay heat. Hence stored in spent fuel pool using the polar crane. So how do you physically separate them?Looks like another BS story about model people.

The pills saturate the thyroid gland and prevent the radioactive iodine-131 from being absorbed, dramatically reducing the risk of thyroid cancers, which are the major potential health effect from the possible progression of the accident.- 30 Km  - stay inside warning issued some time ago.- (per IAEA)  150 people from around the site have been monitored. The results of some people have been reported and 23 have undergone decontamination-Containment  container:  - TEPCO  has evacuated all non-essential personnel from the unit. Fifty of the company's engineers remain to pump seawater into the reactor pressure vessel in an effort to cool it.- (per Tepco -  5pm local time) primary containment vessel around the reactor and secondary containment provided by the reactor building ""show no significant change.""Fire at unit 4, concern for fuel ponds confirmation of  fire burning at unit 4, ( This reactor was closed for periodic inspections when the earthquake and tsunami hit, therefore did not undergo a rapid and sudden shutdown. It was of course violently shaken and subject to the tsunami) Fire fighters noticed ""sign of leakage"".( ""but we have found out the fuel is not causing the fire."") The fire is now reported extinguished. IAEA confirms - fire had taken place in the used fuel storage pool. The Japan Atomic Industry Forum's status report said the water was being supplied to make up for low levels) (BTW, used fuel in cooling ponds require water covering to remove the decay heat (though less after weeks, but still need water)- on one hand it has much bigger area/volume ( than active reactor) to keep it cool but it does contain much much more substance 100s (if not more) tons of fuel so there is lot of heat)-JAIF reporting  that temperatures in the cooling ponds at units 5 and 6 are increasing!FWIW my (shared by many) perspective -(NES Level 4 Accident means) Plant is safe (for all practical purposes)  and will remain safe except  local consequences .. bad for the company that owns the plant, people hurt/killed in blasts,  but not for anyone else...)..

54,ramana,15 Mar 2011 23:32 ,Yes I know Nine mile Point very well. Oswego?It must be NMP-1 as NMP-2 came about in 80s. Its a different BWR than the ones in toruble now. Its a Mark 3 containment with concrete pool instead of the metal torus.Electric malfunctions are normal due to line tripping. These are planned for events. It causes a transient in shutting down the plant. So these type led to thermal cycling and hence fatigue loads.

(Similar to Chernobyl)(I believe that this scenario is highly unlikely due to the use of boron and other neutron killers, but is it possible?). Is this scenario what the Kamikaze solution tries to forestall? 2) More likely  - Multiple cooling failures due to destruction of pipes and other components during the earthquake. This has lead to overheating and melting of the cores. But fissile materials do not attain critical mass so no chain reaction is possible.Consequence - Radioactive materials (iodine and Cesium and even Uranium) are released by coolant in contact with the molten cores and intermittent explosions of hydrogen and other fires. The plant will have large amounts of radioactivity. It will need a long and arduous cleanup process. The area in the 20-30 km radius will need to be monitored continually for contamination."

The explosion released a surge of radiation 800 times more intense than the recommended hourly exposure limit in Japan.But 50 workers stayed behind, a crew no larger than would be stationed at the plant on a quiet spring day. Taking shelter when possible in the reactor’s control room, which is heavily shielded from radiation, they struggled through the morning and afternoon to keep hundreds of gallons of seawater a minute flowing through temporary fire pumps into the three stricken reactors, Nos. 1, 2 and 3, where overheated fuel rods continued to boil away the water at a brisk pace.

70,A_Gupta,16 Mar 2011 03:17 ,"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/world ... ntain.htmlThe warnings were stark and issued repeatedly as far back as 1972: If the cooling systems ever failed at a Mark 1 nuclear reactor, the primary containment vessel surrounding the reactor would probably burst as the fuel rods inside overheated. Dangerous radiation would spew into the environment. ......In some reactors, known as pressurized water reactors, the system is sealed inside a thick, steel-and-cement tomb. Most nuclear reactors around the world are of this type.But the type of containment vessel and pressure suppression system used in the failing reactors at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi plant — and in 23 American reactors at 16 plants — is physically less robust, and it has long been thought to be more susceptible to failure in an emergency than competing designs.G.E. began making the Mark 1 boiling water reactors in the 1960s, marketing them as cheaper and easier to build — in part because they used a comparatively smaller and less expensive containment structure.American regulators began identifying weaknesses very early on. ......A written response came later that same year from Joseph Hendrie, who would later become chairman of the N.R.C. He called the idea of a ban on such systems “attractive” because alternative containment systems have the “notable advantage of brute simplicity in dealing with a primary blowdown.”But he added that the technology had been so widely accepted by the industry and regulatory officials that “reversal of this hallowed policy, particularly at this time, could well be the end of nuclear power.”In an e-mail on Tuesday, David Lochbaum, director of the Nuclear Safety Program at the Union for Concerned Scientists, said those words seemed ironic now, given the potential global ripples on the nuclear industry from the Japanese accident.“Not banning them might be the end of nuclear power,” said Mr. Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer who spent 17 years working in nuclear facilities, including three that used the G.E. design.Questions about the G.E. reactor design escalated in the mid-1980s, when Harold Denton, an official with the N.R.C., asserted that Mark 1 reactors had a 90 percent probability of bursting should the fuel rods overheat and melt in an accident. A follow-up report from a study group convened by the commission concluded that “Mark 1 failure within the first few hours following core melt would appear rather likely.”In an extreme accident, that analysis held, the containment could fail in as little as 40 minutes.Industry officials disputed that assessment, saying the chance of failure was only about 10 percent.

They also have emergency pressurized tanks which dump coolant water (one shot deal). The problem is not cooling hot steam but the reactor core which has decay heat. When the water hits the exposed hot (thermal) reactor core it dissassociates into hydrogen and oxygen. The explosion is from the hydrogen accumulation."

Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists who worked as an instructor on the kinds of General Electric reactors used in Japan. “The reactor is inside thick walls, and the spent fuel of Reactors 1 and 3 is out in the open.” ...A 1997 study by the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island described a worst-case disaster from uncovered spent fuel in a reactor cooling pool. It estimated 100 quick deaths would occur within a range of 500 miles and 138,000 eventual deaths.The study also found that land over 2,170 miles would be contaminated and damages would hit $546 billion.That section of the Brookhaven study focused on boiling water reactors — the kind at the heart of the Japanese crisis.

78,Amber G.,16 Mar 2011 05:27 ,"Fact Sheet ( Fuel Storage at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant) and updatesKey Facts Used nuclear fuel at the Fukushima Daiichi plant is stored in seven pools and in a dry container storage facility (containing nine casks). Sixty percent of the used fuel on site is stored in the shared pool, in a building separated from the reactor buildings; 34 percent of the used fuel is distributed between the six reactor fuel storage pools, and the remaining six percent is stored in the nine dry storage containers.  There are no safety concerns regarding the used fuel in dry storage at Fukushima Daiichi.<snip>What Could Happen During an Accident? The systems that cool and maintain water levels in the pools are designed to withstand severe events.  If these systems are unable to function, the heat generated by the used fuel would result in a slowincrease in the temperature of the spent fuel pool water.  The operating temperature of the pools is typically around 40 degrees C or 100 degrees F (the boiling point for water is 100 C or 212 F).  This slow increase in temperature would result in an increased evaporation rate.  Rapid evaporation of the water will not occur. Exact evaporation rates would depend on the amount of used fuel in the pool and how long it has cooled.  The rate at which the pool water level would decrease (due to evaporation or mild boiling) in the absence of cooling system function would not be expected to lower water levels by more than a few percent per day.  Given that there is approximately 16 feet or more of water above the used fuel assemblies, operators would have ample time (days to weeks) to find another way to add water to the pools before the fuel would become exposed. For example, water could easily be added using a fire hose.2<snip> .Also website says:Tokyo Electric Power Co. said that an oil leak in a cooling water pump at Unit 4 was the cause of a fire that burned for approximately 140 minutes. The fire was not in the spent fuel pool, as reported by several media outlets. Unit 4 was in a 105-day-long maintenance outage at the time of the earthquake and there is no fuel in the reactor.Also:The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has sent 11 experts to Tokyo to provide assistance requested by the Japanese government. Two reactor experts were dispatched Saturday; others began departing Monday."

Waves reached a height of 1,720 feet (576 meters) in the bay, but because the area is relatively isolated and in a unique geologic setting the tsunami did not cause much damage elsewhere. It sank a single boat, killing two fishermen.May 22, 1960: The largest recorded earthquake, magnitude 8.6 in Chile, created a tsunami that hit the Chilean coast within 15 minutes. The surge, up to 75 feet (25 meters) high, killed an estimated 1,500 people in Chile and Hawaii.March 27, 1964: The Alaskan Good Friday earthquake, magnitude between 8.4, spawned a 201-foot (67-meter) tsunami in the Valdez Inlet. It traveled at over 400 mph, killing more than 120 people. Ten of the deaths occurred in Crescent City, in northern California, which saw waves as high as 20 feet (6.3 meters).Aug. 23, 1976: A tsunami in the southwest Philippines killed 8,000 on the heels of an earthquake.July 17, 1998: A magnitude 7.1 earthquake generated a tsunami in Papua New Guinea that quickly killed 2,200.Dec. 26, 2004: A colossal earthquake with a magnitude between 9.1 and 9.3 shook Indonesia and killed an estimated 230,000 people, most due to the tsunami and the lack of aid afterward, coupled with deviating and unsanitary conditions.

Look like that got knocked out too...which means 3 levels of backups all gone. Unless of course, the pumps were only connected to own generated electricity not grid. Wikipedia says these pumps require enormous power, 6MW (yes, that is MW) each which probably means they did not feed the power from elsewhere but from internal? Incidentally they had 8 hrs of battery unlike 4 in US as per reports.Wonder if anyone can plan against such odds..perhaps nearest comparison is aircraft safety systems...already nuke power (in this plant) was considered unviable. That too with Japanese customers paying high rates. One cannot ignore that consideration.

The EEW system can detect the approximate source and magnitude of an earthquake and send out public alerts via TV, radio, and cellphone--all in less than a minute of a quake's start. It also transmits signals that can automatically shut down computers, stop elevators at the nearest floor, and halt factory production lines.According to Masumi Yamada, an assistant professor in the Earthquake Hazards Division at Kyoto University, the 11 March earthquake began at 2:46 p.m. about 150 kilometers off the coast of Miyagi prefecture, and 31 seconds later, residents of the Tohoku region received the first warning via cellphone, TV, and radio. That gave people a lead time of between 10 to 30 seconds before they felt the first tremors [see map].Much of the damage since Friday didn't come directly from the earthquake but rather from the accompanying tsunami, which swept away entire villages along the northeastern coast of Honshu, Japan's main island. The tsunami also flooded backup diesel generators at the Fukushima Dai-1 nuclear plant, thereby preventing cool-down measures. Japan has a tsunami early-warning system, but in this case, there was only about 15 minutes between the first tremors and the tsunami's arrival."

The remaining 97% to 98% U-238 will capture neutrons and become Poo , just like it happens in CANDU. The only difference is in CANDU, you dont need to enrich the fuel because you use heavy water and the ordinary natural uranium which does contain some U-235 is sufficient to sustain a chain reaction. Ordinary water absorbs a certain percentage or neutrons and you cant have a chain reaction in a LWR/PWR without enrichment.However , in CANDU, you need to get heavy water. So in both cases there is a trade off.  But sure, CANDU makes ""more Poo"" than a LWR probably would I guess."

138,ramana,16 Mar 2011 20:44 ,"In the US there is a standard ref eqk for which the full seismic spectrum data is there called El Centro Eqk. The containment bldg with the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) is modelled and subjected to the El Centro eqk adjusted for local/site specific siesmic loads correction factors. The resultant seismic spectrum is used as the forcing function for the design of the plant for normal eqk. loads.  For SSE (max eqk) the spectrum is scaled up to account for 1:500 loads.Usually modern bldgs have 2-3Hz natural frequency and resonate in the low frequencies of the eqk spectrum. (This is why higher floors bldgs feel the response unless they are on isolators when they sway.) Most eqpmt has 12-20 hz natural frequency and thus sees the rigid body motion only. Where things get dicy is a pipe break which causes whipping motion and local high frequency excitation. (Pipes behave like snake with head cut-off and whip around damaging anything nearby.) The other issue is when the system dumps the steam during sudden shutdown into the torus or the cooling pool. It is a mixture of steam and water (flashes due to atmospheric pressure) and that causes high frequency loads (~200 HZ for torus designs). In Fukushima case it was only the Eqk loads that matter and that wasn't the problem. Again loss of on site power to cool the reactor core after shutdown is the issue. And this is mulitple back up systems failure HPCI, LPCI, D-G sets in operable, battery power ran out. Truly black swan in engineering design of nuclear power plants. Hazards analysis was not comprehensive to envisage such a failure.In hind sight folks can claim they located D-G sets above water/flood line but that is by site geography or topography and not by design to minimize hazards. Any one claiming that now is a intellectual charlatan."

Would that be an additional reason for earth based reactors to be more vulnerable? Yes, the ship behaves as one structure and hence individual components are not vibrating out of sync. The analogy is like this. Assuming that you put scatter different stuff on a bed sheet and stick it to the sheet (some papers, rocks, a stone ) and two people hold each end and give it a flutter, each piece will do a crazy jig by itself and do funny things. That is the ground based reactor in an earth quake.Now put that in a stiff steel sheet and pitch it up and down and roll it sideways, yaw it and do all sorts of stuff, the individual pieces are largely in sync with each other and dont do random things relative to each other. That is the stuff on a ship.Notice however, that no structure is infinitely stiff and a ship too bends and flexes under it's own weight and the action of the waves, but the stuff like piping electrical connections etc are designed for that kind of motion, which anyways are rather small.Even planes. For eg, the Concorde underwent so much aero thermic heating that it expanded by nearly a couple of dozen inches in flight and the first set of carpets on the floor were ripped apart because it was one single piece thing! In fact the idea sounds good. Why not place all nuclear reactors on ships and float them in an artificial lake inland?The key single point of failure is the active cooling systems and the need for a large heat sink. The way I think is to have a fully hermetically sealed reactor of the ruggedized navy type  that is installed a bit off the coast in underwater some 20 to 30 meter deep water in a floating/semi submersible offshore platform or better still tethered to the bottom. Those kind of things can take any kind of pounding under any weather, esp the fully underwater ones will be totally unaffected.  Now you are in direct contact with the ultimate heat sink, the ocean, no need for any Paki like pumps for cooling , you can do cooling of the core convection of primary coolant , which in turn can transfer heat to the sea water directly . You eliminate mutiple points of failure that way in a fail safe mode and in the unlikely event of something going really wrong, your Musharraf is well covered because the infinite cooling available will prevent any meltdown. Not sure if such a thing is workable on land.. Maybe in the Great Lakes in Unkil land, but definitely wouldn't pull that stunt in Ulsoor lake in Bangalore Kerala. So even in a worst case scenario, the thing sinks to the ocean bottom, it will be perfectly fine and stable until kingdom come.No chance of any explosion due to meltdown or anything.Atleast land acquisition wont be a problem. Out of sight, out of mind. Somehow I dont see the Mr & Mrs Karat and Mr Yechury getting on to a catamaran and picketing something some 1km out into the sea. It will draw a huge collective yawn.I do think engineering wise, the Nuke establishment need to rethink their strategies on the entire thing. Too much dependence on all the ducks lining up all the time has been the problem. And if one duck doesn't line up and acts Paki, there is serious trouble. They need to miniaturize (easily doable as the ship board plants show), increase ruggedness, have fail safe methods in engineering based on passive designs with no or very few points of failure which are very well addressed in the design. Sure, you could ask, but then you cant have a nuke plant away from the coast! Maybe you shouldn't! In fact, think of it. The Russian method of disposing off their Naval Nuke reactors is to encase it in lead and concrete and dunk it into the deepest ocean close by! There you are ,it gets cooled perpetually, no need for any more Pakiness, concrete hardens with cooling as time goes by, everything safely, nothing corrodes over time , no radioactivity escapes, all Piss and Plogress onree. Think of this.

159,Amber G.,17 Mar 2011 05:26 ,"From mitnse.com.. (Sorry if already posted)Units 1 and 2: TEPCO has released estimates of the levels of core damage at these two reactors: 70% damage at Unit 1 and 33% at Unit 2. They have also stated that Unit 1 is being adequately cooled.Outlook: It is difficult to make conjectures at this point about the final disposition of the damaged fuel without further information. However, during our only operating experience with a partially melted and subsequently cooled core, Three Mile Island, the fuel mass was fully contained by the reactor vessel, resulting in minimal radiation release to the public. A decision is currently being made on how to best supply cooling water to Unit 2.Unit 3: At 8:34 AM JST, white smoke was seen billowing from the roof of Unit 3. The source of this smoke was not investigated because workers were evacuated due to radiation levels. These levels had been fluctuating during the early morning hours before rising to 300-400 millisievert/hr around the time that the smoke appeared. It was unclear at the time whether these rising levels were a result of some new event at Unit 3, or were lingering as a result of Unit 2’s recent troubles.Outlook: In order to provide some perspective on worker doses to this point, radiation sickness sets in at roughly 1000 millisieverts. A future post will deal further with the health effects of various amounts of radiation. Response to the smoke seen at Unit 3 appears to be in an information gathering phase at this point. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano speculated that the smoke from Unit 3 might be the result of a similar wetwell explosion to that at Unit 2, but there is not enough information currently available to support or refute that statement.Units 4-6: Flames at Unit 4 were reported to be the result of a pump fire, which caused a small explosion that damaged the roof of Unit 4 .... Efforts at Units 4-6 are focused on supplying cooling water to the spent fuel storage pools. Temperatures in these pools began to rise in the days after the quake. At the time of the quake, only Unit 4’s core had been fully offloaded to the spent fuel pool for maintenance; roughly 1/3 of the cores of Units 5 and 6 had been offloaded. This explains in part why the temperature in Unit 4’s pool has risen faster than at the other reactors: it has a higher inventory, both in fuel volume and in heat load.Outlook: The fuel within these pools needs to remain covered with cooling water in order to prevent the low levels of decay heat present from causing it to melt, and also in order to provide shielding. Boiling of the water results in reduction of the water level in the pools, so if/when the pools get hot enough for boiling to begin, water needs to be added to replace what boils off. The staff of Unit 4 plan to begin pumping water to the spent fuel pool from ground level as soon as radiation levels from Unit 3 are low enough for them to return. This pumping operation should be relatively easier than injection of cooling water into the reactor vessels at Units 1-3 because the pools are at atmospheric pressure....Japan indicates that radiation levels as a result of the Unit 4 fire were higher than those reported previously. Radiation levels early this morning at the outside of Unit 3 measured at 400 millisieverts/hr. At the present time however, radiation levels at the boundary of the facility are 1530 microsieverts/hour. We will continue to update as further reliable information is available."
160,Airavat,17 Mar 2011 05:30 ,"Containment vessel failure unlikely: Japan TimesChief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters in the afternoon that the government now believes the water pool for spent nuclear fuel at the No. 3 reactor probably heated up, causing steam to rise. If the fuel rods were to melt, high amounts of radiation could be released into the environment. The pool is not in the containment vessel. Unlike the reactor itself, the fuel pool is not protected by a containment vessel and the roof of the No. 3 building was blown away by an earlier hydrogen explosion.The temperature of the water in the spent fuel pool at the No. 4 unit also spiked Wednesday. The reactor had caught fire a day earlier after a hydrogen blast created two big holes in the facility's wall. Providing more water is urgently needed to prevent the fuel rods from melting. In a race against time to cool the water pool, the government dispatched a Self-Defense Forces C-47 helicopter carrying a bladder to dump water into the pool. But the plan was canceled for the day because of the abnormally high level of radiation escaping from the plant. It was later reported that a Metropolitan Police Department water cannon was requested to pump watere into the overheating facilities.At present, residents within a 20-km radius have been ordered to evacuate and people between a 20- to 30-km radius have been instructed to stay indoors. Seawater continued to be pumped into all the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 reactors, but water levels were still not high enough to cool all of the fuel rods."

Prominent companies operated with an extensive reach into personal lives; their executives were admired for their role as corporate citizens.But over the past decade or so, the bureaucrats’ authority has been eviscerated, and corporations have lost both power and swagger as the economy has floundered. Yet no strong political class has emerged to take their place. Four prime ministers have come and gone in less than four years; most political analysts had already written off the fifth, Naoto Kan, even before the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster. ...The absence of a strong leader capable of rallying the nation has never been more obvious than in the management of the efforts to contain the growing nuclear crisis.“In the past, bureaucrats would have been issuing orders without even consulting with politicians,” said Takeshi Sasaki, a political scientist at Gakushuin University. “Now the bureaucrats are no longer involved, and the government keeps holding news conferences, but there is no evidence I can see that it is doing anything beyond that.

So long as radiological conditions allow, a team of workers pumps seawater into the reactor vessels. This boils away, raising steam pressure which must later be vented. Fuel assemblies are exposed by between one and two metres at the top, but the high thermal conductivity of the zirconium alloy rod casings helps cooling with just the lower portion of the rods submerged. This process is set to continue until the heat produced by the core has reduced so that the entire core can be covered. Radiation levels on site are fluctuating, which makes it difficult for engineers to work as well as to analyse the extent of possible damage to various functional systems in the reactor buildings. Venting steam from units 1, 2 and 3 contributes a certain amount which dissipates in a matter of hours. It is thought some emission is the result of damage to unit 2's torus. Any release due to damaged nuclear fuel is unknown. The peak of radiation on site is near unit 3, where levels of 400 millisieverts per hour have been recorded. Dose limits to workers under emergency regulations have been raised to 250 millisieverts from 100 millisieverts after which they may not return. This compares to usual nuclear worker limits of 20 millisieverts per year.     wrt to spent fuel storage (which, IMO,  is a serious  cause of concern).. CNN was reporting the helicopters being used to dump water. (about 7-10 tons per trip - the total amount of water in pool is few thousand tons!)More details:   (IAEA)  - About 60% of the total used nuclear fuel from all six reactors is kept in a shared facility, while each of the units also has its own storage pool near the top of the reactor building.-  At unit 4, the reactor itself contains no fuel, this having been removed to the unit's own store over 100 days ago for maintenance work to take place. - Last known temp was on march 15 (on unit 4) at 84 C.. no data for march 16) (Building 'severely' damaged due to fire - water level low, details ""unknown""  due to radiation people were not able to go etc..) - Unit 5 water temp rising (last reading 62.5 C)- Unit 6 (60 C) (rising)"

A nice Fyzzics answer . That constant heat of boiling is the top end in terms of amount of heat you can transfer out, true. But the Yin Jin Ear Ring answer will depend on heat transfer rates. To keep the zircon cladding from going Paki and melting, it needs a minimum heat transfer rate away from the cladding. I don't know what and how much boiling is allowed in the BWR (maybe just on the surface/bubble forming kind of stuff, which is efficient), but if you allow full boiling of the coolant and working fluid (same in the BWR), then the heat transfer rates away from the fuel rods will fall and the cladding and fuel temp will rise and can go Paki! Depends on design details of BWR I guess. The max heat transfer rates are if the water is in liquid state. That is why in PWR /PHWR reactors, the water is pressurized and never allowed to boil! The reason why the BWR is thermodynamically more efficient than the PWR is because in BWR unlike the PWR, there is no heat transfer (which is lossy) from inner loop  (which is in contact with the fuel) to the outer loop (which drives the generators)."

And yes a few such reactors have gone down, mostly submarines.I am not advocating a ship based reactor which needs enrichment to around 20% levels or so to make it ultra compact to fit into small machinery spaces in subs and ships where the bulk of the space is devoted to mission requirements.What I am actually talking about is a normal type design that is compacted somewhat and is custom sited underwater in a semi submersible kind of thing . This entire cooling pump and other business of cooling is too risk prone if you depend on a pump and in fact dunking the whole reactor thing under water might be a much safer option. That is all.  Something like  ""gravity stabilized  oil rig"" (google for it) kind of thing in some 40/50 meter deep water will be fine! No Pakiness possible. No loss of coolant possible. No nothing. The thing cant blow up. Very simple stuff like pressure release valve opening if pressure increases will bring it directly in thermal contact with the sink and cool the ""Durvasa"" down.  This is very expensive. Also marine reactors are not as efficient as land based ones in converting heat to electricity. The high motion puts limits on turbine efficiency.The design criteria for a minaturized powerplant for ship and an electric power plant are different. They trade off efficiency for ultra compactness there.  You can do much better for a power plant (you can put the turbine on a platform on the surface for eg) . It is just a mindset change. The industry has vested interest in ""gradual/incremental change"" so that they dont need to do anything fundamentally different and can keep selling tweaked versions of existing designs.   No one had any fundamentally radical ideas , except for that  Pebble bed reactor kind of thing.  Maybe , this is where India /PSU/Socialism kind of thing can work if they can break the mould in totally new pathbreaking ways."

Granted, the West has not helped Japan much in their economic plight, but what is the motivation for them to see Japan suffer? Aren't they friendly allies? One can extend the CT to say, some USA based auto-manufacturers see it the right time to create a dent in Japanese auto-makers. But these auto-makers have plants in USA.

And with the rising China, India and Japan two democracies, with India's economic rapidly rising and Japan's economy being the 3rd largest will be good balance.

For chernobylTHE ABOVE STATEMENT IS A LIE (this is a partial list of DISTANT events)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster    * Down syndrome (trisomy 21). In West Berlin, Germany, prevalence of Down syndrome (trisomy 21) peaked 9 months following the main fallout.[ 11, 12] Between 1980 and 1986, the birth prevalence of Down syndrome was quite stable (i.e., 1.35–1.59 per 1,000 live births [27–31 cases]). In 1987, 46 cases were diagnosed (prevalence = 2.11 per 1,000 live births). Most of the excess resulted from a cluster of 12 cases among children born in January 1987. The prevalence of Down syndrome in 1988 was 1.77, and in 1989, it reached pre-Chernobyl values. The authors noted that the isolated geographical position of West Berlin prior to reunification, the free genetic counseling, and complete coverage of the population through one central cytogenetic laboratory support completeness of case ascertainment; in addition, constant culture preparation and analysis protocols ensure a high quality of data.    * Chromosomal aberrations. Reports of structural chromosome aberrations in people exposed to fallout in Belarus and other parts of the former Soviet Union, Austria, and Germany argue against a simple dose-response relationship between degree of exposure and incidence of aberrations. These findings are relevant because a close relationship exists between chromosome changes and congenital malformations. Inasmuch as some types of aberrations are almost specific for ionizing radiation, researchers use aberrations to assess exposure dose. On the basis of current coefficients, however, one cannot assume that calculation of individual exposure doses resulting from fallout would not induce measurable rates of chromosome aberrations.    * Neural tube defects (NTDs) in Turkey. During the embryonic phase of fetal development, the neural tube differentiates into the brain and spinal cord (i.e., collectively forming the central nervous system). Chemical or physical interactions with this process can cause NTDs. Common features of this class of malformations are more or less extended fissures, often accompanied by consecutive dislocation of central nervous system (CNS) tissue. NTDs include spina bifida occulta and aperta, encephalocele, and—in the extreme case—anencephaly. The first evidence in support of a possible association between CNS malformations and fallout from Chernobyl was published by Akar et al.. in 1988. The Mustafakemalpasa State Hospital, Bursa region, covers a population of approximately 90,000. Investigators have documented the prevalence of malformations since 1983. The prevalence of NTDs was 1.7 to 9.2 per 1,000 births, but during the first 6 months of 1987 increased to 20 per 1,000 (12 cases). The excess was most pronounced for the subgroup of anencephalics, in which prevalence increased 5-fold (i.e., 10 per 1,000 [6 cases]). In the consecutive months that followed (i.e., July–December 1987), the prevalence decreased again (1.3 per 1,000 for all NTDs, 0.6 per 1,000 for anencephaly), and it reached pre-Chernobyl levels during the first half of 1988 (all NTDs: 0.6 per 1,000; anencephaly: 0.2 per 1,000). This initial report was supported by several similar findings in observational studies from different regions of Turkey.[citation needed]"

They have this fixation with 1971-72 when oil prices delivered terminal shocks to japanese economy. It is a watershed year for them. This forced them to favour nuclear as dependence on imports is quite less.On the nuclear safety issues they were quite confident. I am sure that they have managed so admirably till now is all due to their meticulous preparation and following them to the letter.

The pool still has water providing some cooling for the fuel; however, helicopters dropped water on the reactor four times during the morning (Japan time) on March 17. Water also was sprayed at reactor 4 using high-pressure water cannons.Reactors 5 and 6 were both shut down before the quake occurred. Primary and secondary containments are intact at both reactors. Temperature instruments in the spent fuel pools at reactors 5 and 6 are operational, and temperatures are being maintained at about 62 degrees Celsius. TEPCO is continuing efforts to restore power at reactor 5.Fukushima Daini All four reactors at the Fukushima Daini plant have reached cold shutdown conditions with normal cooling being maintained using residual heat removal (RHR) systems."

When engineers are claiming they can design structures for even a 10.0 Richter scale quake (with large ground acceleration locally) one begins to wonder. All other reactor design (BWR vs PHWR etc) related issues will side track from the real root cause, shortcoming in traditional engineering, quality control etc. Note, that even during normal operations, in one of the links given above bursting pipes was quoted, or damaged pressure vessel at manufacture.

The United States, with Japanese permission, began to put the intelligence-collection aircraft over the site, in hopes of gaining a view for Washington as well as its allies in Tokyo that did not rely on the announcements of officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates Fukushima Daiichi.American officials say they suspect that the company has consistently underestimated the risk and moved too slowly to contain the damage....So far the officials saw no signs of dropping temperatures. And the Web site of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, made it clear that there were no readings at all from some critical areas. Part of the American effort, by satellites and aircraft, is to identify the hot spots, something the Japanese have not been able to do in some cases. {<-- see this part}...The sensors on the instrument pod are good at mapping radioactive isotopes, like cesium 137, which has been detected around the nuclear plant and has a half-life of 30 years. In high doses, it can cause acute radiation sickness. Lower doses can alter cellular function, leading to an increased risk of cancer.Cesium 137 can enter the body through many foods, including milk....Jeffrey G. Lewis, an intelligence specialist at the Monterey Institute, a research center, noted that the Japanese assessment of Reactor No. 4 at the Daiichi complex seemed to depend in part on visual surveillance by helicopter pilots....American officials have also worried that the spent-fuel pool at that reactor has run dry, exposing the rods. Japanese officials, however, have concentrated much of their recent efforts on Reactor No. 3, which has been intermittently releasing radiation from what the authorities believe may be a ruptured containment vessel around the reactor. Temperatures at that reactor’s spent fuel pool are also high.Perhaps because of the difficulties experienced Thursday trying to accurately drop water from helicopters, the Japanese military announced Friday that it was halting those efforts for at least a day."

246,amit,18 Mar 2011 14:49 ,"It's almost sickening to see the fervent anticipation and prayer for a Chernobyl type of meltdown at Fukushima just so that some debating points can be scored.Also it's one thing for press to sensationalize events and for the Ukrainians  to score a few brownie points by comparing it with the Chernobyl disaster that will forever hang like a Albatross around their necks. It's quite another for participants in what is supposed to be an ""informed"" discussion going to town with such reports.What happened in Chernobyl has been posted many times but what heck here's it again. The Chernobyl disaster was a unique event and the only accident in the history of commercial nuclear power where radiation-related fatalities occurred. However, the design of the reactor is unique and the accident is thus of little relevance to the rest of the nuclear industry outside the then Eastern Bloc.On 25 April, prior to a routine shutdown, the reactor crew at Chernobyl 4 began preparing for a test to determine how long turbines would spin and supply power to the main circulating pumps following a loss of main electrical power supply. This test had been carried out at Chernobyl the previous year, but the power from the turbine ran down too rapidly, so new voltage regulator designs were to be tested.A series of operator actions, including the disabling of automatic shutdown mechanisms, preceded the attempted test early on 26 April. By the time that the operator moved to shut down the reactor, the reactor was in an extremely unstable condition. A peculiarity of the design of the control rods caused a dramatic power surge as they were inserted into the reactor.There's a discussion on the positive void coefficient of the RBMK reactor, a subject which, if I'm not mistaken Ramana and AmberG have already covered.The interaction of very hot fuel with the cooling water led to fuel fragmentation along with rapid steam production and an increase in pressure. The design characteristics of the reactor were such that substantial damage to even three or four fuel assemblies can – and did – result in the destruction of the reactor. The overpressure caused the 1000 t cover plate of the reactor to become partially detached, rupturing the fuel channels and jamming all the control rods, which by that time were only halfway down. Intense steam generation then spread throughout the whole core (fed by water dumped into the core due to the rupture of the emergency cooling circuit) causing a steam explosion and releasing fission products to the atmosphere. About two to three seconds later, a second explosion threw out fragments from the fuel channels and hot graphite. There is some dispute among experts about the character of this second explosion, but it is likely to have been caused by the production of hydrogen from zirconium-steam reactions.Leaving aside the verdict of history on its role in melting the Soviet 'Iron Curtain', some very tangible practical benefits have resulted from the Chernobyl accident. The main ones concern reactor safety, notably in eastern Europe. (The US Three Mile Island accident in 1979 had a significant effect on Western reactor design and operating procedures. While that reactor was destroyed, all radioactivity was contained – as designed – and there were no deaths or injuries.)While no-one in the West was under any illusion about the safety of early Soviet reactor designs, some lessons learned have also been applicable to Western plants. Certainly the safety of all Soviet-designed reactors has improved vastly. This is due largely to the development of a culture of safety encouraged by increased collaboration between East and West, and substantial investment in improving the reactorsIt's well documented that the faulty design of the RBMK reactor and incredibly sloppy project management resulted in the Chernobyl disaster. There was no natural disaster and the accident occurred on a fine day in AprilNow to compare this accident with the Fukushima incident which has occurred due to a classic Black Swan event is... Well never mind!It always helps to keep a sense of perspective. The situation in Fukushima is in no way near Chernobyl. And at the risk of being called a US stooge and a paid GE agent ""whose roji roti depends on this"", I would mount a fervent prayer that it doesn't go that way and they manage to get it under control."

Just a suggestionsMeanwhile Japan's Nuclear  and industrial safety agency has raised the level to 5 , equal to what was in 1979 Pennsylvania Three mile Island disaster.Japan has raised the alert level at a stricken nuclear plant from four to five on a seven-point international scale for atomic incidents.The crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi site is now two levels below Ukraine's 1986 Chernobyl disaster.The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog warned in Tokyo the battle to stabilise the plant was a race against time.The crisis was prompted by last week's huge quake and tsunami, which has left at least 16,000 people dead or missing.The Japanese nuclear agency's decision to raise the alert level to five grades Fukushima's as an ""accident with wider consequences"".Meanwhile, further heavy snowfall overnight all but ended hopes of rescuing anyone else from the rubble after the 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami.Millions of survivors have been left without water, electricity, fuel or enough food; hundreds of thousands more are homeless.According to the latest figures, 6,405 people are dead and about 10,200 are missing.I was under impression that there was partial meltdown at Three mile island disaster.Is it true? I sure hope there is no such thing in fukushima. Japanese have really excelled in disaster management post quake and tsunami. Their calm and methodical approach , to which many of brf members are first hand witness,  is simply amazing.The calm they have displayed is really extraordinary. No news of looting , rioting or even a word of protest. Only some concerns about information sharing.It also goes on to exhibit the point that by and large design of nuke reactor was quite robust to have managed this far,hough not robust enough to withstand quake and tsunami of 8.9 scale.That is an old design  going way back to  1970 of BWR type GE (unkil) supplied. Do we need to read something into this, the way western media has played the role. Not concentrating on efficient management of disaster by japanese,rather  playing up the impact on tokyo, does not lend more credibility to them.Another issue seems to be that there are too many reactors cramped in a small area , all for a different reason, but that does complicate the crisis management.I am sure that newer designs would have incorporated better safety measures.  Lessons from this disaster would be appropriately taken and implemented .  This disaster should not reflect as such on the merits and demerits of nuke case but if alternatives are available that should be explored first. After all, accident at nuke plant can not be at par with accident at thermal plant or rail accident or car accident or other natural disaster. Radiation effects in the disaster area is going to be  long term ."

Not someone, but I pointed out, unless you wish to ignore.   The information is firsthand though Govt websites of Japan do give indications to that effect.Here is some quotehttp://www.fepc.or.jp/english/energy_el ... index.htmljapan's first commercial nuclear power plant started operation in Ibaraki Prefecture in 1966. As of the end of December 2009, Japan has fifty-four reactors operating around the country, usually accounting for around one-third of the country's total electric power output. By fiscal 2018, the nuclear output share is expected to reach 40 percent. Currently, there are three plants under construction, as well as another ten that are in the advanced planning stages.While placing the highest priority on nuclear safety and public trust, Japanese electric power companies will continue to develop nuclear power generation as a base-load power source that plays an important role in Japan's electric power supply in order to secure a steady supply of electricity and address global environmental issues.This is what wikipedia tells us.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_JapanThe ratio of nuclear power generation to total electricity production increased from 2% in 1973 to 23.6% in 1990.So it is 30% and going on to 40%  well from 2% in 1973.I have graphs and ppts given by Japanese energy officials  which indicate 1970 as watershed year ( though I can't share for obvious reasons.) just as we see 1947 or 1971 as watershed years in our discourse.Nuke energy is not a favorable model worldwide.This report seems to indicate that.http://www.scientificamerican.com/artic ... tical-massThis month, Finland's Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor was supposed to begin generating power, a tangible sign of the revival of the nuclear industry outside of Asia after nearly 30 years of no new construction because of accidents, cost-overruns and other issues. Instead, the reactor won't be completed for more than three more years, its price is nearly 60 percent more than anticipated, and it is mired in costly legal squabbles between the builder, Areva, and the Finnish utility, Pohjolan Voima.In the U.S., since 2003, 17 applications for 26 new reactors have been filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but not one is yet under construction.Despite dozens of new nuclear plants ordered or built in Asia in recent years, ""increased deployment of nuclear power has been slow both in the United States and globally,"" wrote the authors of a new Massachusetts Institute of Technology review of the state of nuclear power.Those figures, say the authors of the report, an update on a similar report in 2003, mean that ""even if all the announced plans for new nuclear power plant construction are realized, the total will be well behind that needed for reaching a thousand gigawatts of new capacity worldwide by 2050.""One thousand gigawatts is the number the M.I.T. professors estimated would be needed to ensure that nuclear power provided 20 percent of global electricity needs as well as cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants. In the U.S., the number would be jumping from 100 to 300 gigawatts of nuclear-sourced electricity by 2050.After all, once operating, nuclear power plants burn nothing and therefore emit no carbon dioxide as fossil fuel–burning power plants do. (There are, of course, significant greenhouse gas emissions associated with building and fueling nuclear facilities).But the price of new nuclear power has ""escalated dramatically,"" according to the report, jumping by 15 percent a year to reach as much as $4,000 per kilowatt compared with $2,300 for coal-fired generation and just $850 for natural gas. And the industry is asking for at least $100 billion in federal tax subsidies and loan guarantees for the 26 reactors currently planned.The situation is no better in Europe, according to Steven Thomas, a professor of energy studies at the University of Greenwich in London: Finland cannot complete its new reactor; the U.K. has yet to get started on any projects; and a new nuclear reactor in France, after 18 months of construction, is 20 percent overbudget and requires complete subsidy by the French government.""The nuclear power industry in Europe is in the midst of the same kind of regulatory and financial uncertainty that makes the future of the industry murky at best in this country,"" Thomas said during a conference call with reporters. ""We've been waiting for the renaissance for 10 years.""Nor has there been a solution to the issue of nuclear waste. In the U.S., the plan to use Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert as a repository for spent nuclear fuel rods is in limbo, opposed by the Obama administration. Reprocessing nuclear fuel, currently underway only in France, has proved prohibitively expensive, and it raises concerns about the proliferation of plutonium for nuclear weapons.These are the links to MIT reporthttp://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuc ... ummary.pdfhttp://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuc ... r-full.pdfand 2009 updatehttp://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuc ... te2009.pdfConclusions in briefThe report maintains that ""The nuclear option should be retained precisely because it is an important carbon-free source of power.""""Fossil fuel-based electricity is projected to account for more than 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2020,"" said Deutch. ""In the U.S. 90% of the carbon emissions from electricity generation come from coal-fired generation, even though this accounts for only 52% of the electricity produced. Taking nuclear power off the table as a viable alternative will prevent the global community from achieving long-term gains in the control of carbon dioxide emissions.""But the prospects for nuclear energy as an option are limited, the report finds, by four unresolved problems: high relative costs; perceived adverse safety, environmental, and health effects; potential security risks stemming from proliferation; and unresolved challenges in long-term management of nuclear wastes.The study examines a growth scenario where the present deployment of 360 GWe of nuclear capacity worldwide is expanded to 1000 GWe in mid-century, keeping nuclear's share of the electricity market about constant. Deployment in the U.S. would expand from about 100 GWe today to 300 GWe in mid-century. This scenario is not a prediction, but rather a study case in which nuclear power would make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emissions.""There is no question that the up-front costs associated with making nuclear power competitive, are higher than those associated with fossil fuels,"" said Dr. Moniz. ""But as our study shows, there are many ways to mitigate these costs and, over time, the societal and environmental price of carbon emissions could dramatically improve the competitiveness of nuclear power""Update points out thatToday, there are about 44 plants under construction  around the world in 12  countries, principally China, India, Korea, and Russia. There are no new plants  under construction in the United States. The slow pace of this deployment  means that the mid-century scenario of 1000 GWe of operating nuclear power around the globe and 300 GWe in the United States is less likely than when it was considered in the 2003 study.and concludesThe central premise of the 2003 MIT Study on the Future of Nuclear Power was that the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in order to mitigate global warming, justified reevaluating the role of nuclear power in the country’s energy future. The 2003 study identified the challenges to greater deployment and argued that the key need was to design, build, and operate a few first-of-a-kind nuclear plants with government assistance, to demonstrate to the public, political leaders, and investors the technical performance, cost, and environmental acceptability of the technology. After five years, no new plants are under construction in the United States and insufficient progress has been made on waste management. The current assistance program put into place by the 2005 EPACT has not yet been effective and needs to be improved. The sober warning is that if more is not done, nuclear power will diminish as a practical and timely option for deployment at a scale that would constitute a material contribution to climate change risk mitigation.Points made by sanku ji has been well discussed in the report.I would also request the moderators to move tech posts to relevant thread."

The explosion in Chernobyl was powerful enough that any containment dome would have most likely been blown off as well. Most media miss this point.

A nice Fyzzics answer . That constant heat of boiling is the top end in terms of amount of heat you can transfer out, true. But the Yin Jin Ear Ring answer will depend on heat transfer rates. To keep the zircon cladding from going Paki and melting, it needs a minimum heat transfer rate away from the cladding. I don't know what and how much boiling is allowed in the BWR (maybe just on the surface/bubble forming kind of stuff, which is efficient), but if you allow full boiling of the coolant and working fluid (same in the BWR), then the heat transfer rates away from the fuel rods will fall and the cladding and fuel temp will rise and can go Paki! Depends on design details of BWR I guess. The max heat transfer rates are if the water is in liquid state. That is why in PWR /PHWR reactors, the water is pressurized and never allowed to boil! The reason why the BWR is thermodynamically more efficient than the PWR is because in BWR unlike the PWR, there is no heat transfer (which is lossy) from inner loop  (which is in contact with the fuel) to the outer loop (which drives the generators).Vinaji - I have all the respect, and admire  many  who have devoted years of their life studying  ""heat transfer""..and it is no exaggeration that the physics of heat transfer is order of magnitude more important in this case than other branches such as nuclear fission..(Even for Microsoft,   they would have avoided a lot of headaches and re-engineering efforts on Xbox if some one did not goof up in its heat-sink design)..But still...(:)  this is not a normal situation, you have a crippled cooling system and if you can only circulate x amount of water those numbers ( 2,240,000 J v 4000 J) are important.

If fission energy from say 20% of the fuel mass is released in 20 milliseconds you get a nuke bomb with temperatures in the millions of deg C at the core. If that same fission energy is allowed to gradually heat up the fuel and build up in the area - you get all those ""melt-down"" temperatures - one of the links said that Zircalloy melts at 1200 deg C and something else glows at 2400 deg  C. These are ""cool"" temperatures and a very slow release of energy compared to a bomb.  And with 20% enrichment at best I fail to see how a reaction leading to a fission explosion can be sustained.

No one is talking of boulder sized ice. Something smaller - big enough to retain integrity as it falls to ground and in a predictable trajectory but small enough to melt fast enough - maybe not slurry. Again consider both convection and conduction. In the first place remember the reactor is using water for heat transfer.

I am worried about structural integrity. You are more or less looking at making a solid tomb. Not a shell. But given the circumstances maybe only option. Again you need equipment that can deliver huge quantities of lead laced concrete slurry to build a solid mountain around the reactor.

The helicopter was measuring radiation levels above Unit 4 reactor secondary containment building in preparation for water drops. This report has not been officially confirmed.2. WNN says:The Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry said at 8.38pm that a cable was being laid to bring external power from transmission lines owned by Tohoku Electric Power Company. This was to be connected when radiation levels had died down after a planned venting operation at unit 2. In addition, one of the emergency diesel units can now be operated and will be used to supply unit 5 and 6 alternately to inject water to their used fuel pools. Later, the power will be used to top up water in the reactor vessels…After clearing heavy explosion debris from tsunami and the various explosions across the site over the last six days, eleven high pressure fire trucks showered unit 3. World Nuclear News understands that 30 tonnes of water “was delivered” in an attempt to shoot water through the holes in the side of the building, which appear to be very close to the fuel ponds themselves…Despite high levels of radiation close to the units, levels detected at the edge of the power plant site have been steadily decreasing [the below is given in reverse chronological order].17 March, 4.00pm: 0.64 millisieverts per hour17 March, 9.00am: 1.47 millisieverts per hour16 March, 7.00pm: 1.93 millisieverts per hour16 March, 12.30pm: 3.39 millisieverts per hour3. The two statements above are supported by the updates from the NEI:In Japan, engineers have laid a power line that can connect reactor 2 of the Daiichi facility to the off-site power grid, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported. Workers are working to reconnect the power to reactor 2 after they complete spraying water into the reactor 3 complex to provide additional cooling to the used fuel pool. Reconnecting to the power grid is expected to enhance efforts to prevent further damage at the plant.Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency reported on Thursday that the backup diesel generator for reactor 6 is working and supplying electricity to reactors 5 and 6. TEPCO is preparing to add water to the storage pools that house used nuclear fuel rods at those two reactors.Radiation readings at the Fukushima Daiichi site boundary were measured today at a lower level, between 2 and 3 millirem per hour.Fukushima Daiichi site statusThe reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant are in stable condition and are being cooled with seawater, but workers at the plant continue efforts to add cooling water to fuel pools at reactors 3 and 4. The status of the reactors at the site is as follows:Reactor 1’s primary containment is believed to be intact and the reactor is in a stable condition. Seawater injection into the reactor is continuing.Reactor 2 is in stable condition with seawater injection continuing. The reactor’s primary containment may not have been breached, Tokyo Electric Power Co. and World Association of Nuclear Operators officials said on Thursday. Containment pressure is at 65 psig, an indication that containment has not been breached.Access problems at the site have delayed connection of a temporary cable to restore offsite electricity. The connection will provide power to the control rod drive pump, instrumentation, batteries, and power to the control room. Power has not been available at the site since the earthquake on March 11.Reactor 3 is in stable condition with seawater injection continuing. The primary containment is believed to be intact. Pressure in the containment has fluctuated due to venting of the reactor containment structure, but has been as high as 83 psig.TEPCO officials say that although one side of the concrete wall of the fuel pool structure has collapsed, the steel liner of the pool remains intact, based on aerial photos of the reactor taken on March 17. The pool still has water providing some cooling for the fuel, however helicopters dropped water on the reactor four times during the morning (Japan time) on March 17. Water also was sprayed at reactor 4 using high pressure water cannons.Reactors 5 and 6 were both shut down before the quake occurred. Primary and secondary containments are intact at both reactors. Temperature instruments in the spent fuel pools at reactors 5 and 6 are operational, and temperatures are being maintained at about 62 degrees Celsius. TEPCO is continuing efforts to restore power at reactor 5.If all of this is successful, the plant will be able to take over from the workers in cooling the fuel in the reactor.I’ll provide a further update at the end of today. Meanwhile, you can track the comments on this post (Note: I suggest we switch to this thread for the rest of today), which are once again doing a great job at providing a minute-by-minute feed of the latest developments.Below I reproduce a short essay by Ted Rockwell. Dr Rockwell is a member of the National Academy of Engineering. His classical 1956 handbook, The Reactor Shielding Design Manual, was recently made available on-line and as a DVD, by the U.S. Department of Energy. Back in 2002 he was co-author on an article in Science journal, “Nuclear Power Plants and Their Fuel as Terrorist Targets“. It’s definitely worth reading as it’s highly relevant to the current situation — if you bear in mind that the ‘terrorist’ in this context was Mother Nature — and a brutal one at that.Ted’s short essay (Rod Adams has also reproduced this), given below, explains well what I meant by my earlier statement:What has this earthquake taught us? That it’s much, much riskier to choose to live next to the ocean than it is to live next to a nuclear power station.—————————-Fukushima: it’s not about radiation, it’s about tsunamisA lot of wrong lessons are being pushed on us, about the tragedy now unfolding in Japan. All the scare-talk about radiation is irrelevant. There will be no radiation public health catastrophe, regardless of how much reactor melting may occur. Radiation? Yes. Catastrophe? No.Life evolved on, and adapted to, a much more radioactive planet, Our current natural radiation levels—worldwide—are below optimum. Statements that there is no safe level of radiation are an affront to science and to common sense. The radiation situation should be no worse than from the Three Mile Island (TMI) incident, where ten to twenty tons of the nuclear reactor melted down, slumped to the bottom of the reactor vessel, and initiated the dreaded China Syndrome, where the reactor core melts and burns its way into the earth. On the computers and movie screens of people who make a living “predicting” disasters, TMI is an unprecedented catastrophe. In the real world, the molten mass froze when it hit the colder reactor vessel, and stopped its downward journey at five-eights of an inch through the five-inch thick vessel wall.And there was no harm to people or the environment. None.Yet in Japan, you have radiation zealots threatening to order people out of their homes, to wander, homeless and panic-stricken, through the battered countryside, to do what? All to avoid a radiation dose lower than what they would get from a ski trip.The important point for nuclear power is that some of the nuclear plants were swept with a wall of seawater that may have instantly converted a multi-billion dollar asset into a multi-billion dollar problem. That’s bad news. But it’s not unique to nuclear power. If Fukushima were a computer chip factory, would we consider abandoning the electronic industry because it was not tsunami-proof? It would be ironic if American nuclear power were phased out as unsafe, without having ever killed or injured a single member of the public, to be replaced by coal, gas and oil, proven killers of tens of thousands each year.Moreover, the extent and nature of the damage from seawater may be less than first implied. Rod Adams, a former nuclear submarine officer, who operated a nuclear power plant at sea for many years, says that inadvertent flooding of certain equipment with seawater was not uncommon. He includes electronics-laden missile tubes. “We flushed them out with fresh water,” he said. “Sometimes we had to replace insulation and other parts. But we could ultimately bring them back on line, working satisfactorily.”The lessons from Japan involve tsunamis, not radiation.———————–Footnote – Some additional comments from Ted Rockwell, by email correspondence:I must admit that our Science articles did not give much attention attention to the small-volume containment plants, and we should do so after the information on Fukushima has come in. Our focus was on getting past the proving that scenarios that led to intolerable situations were tolerably improbable. This traditional approach is an essential but not sufficient part of plant design.My approach was to come in from the other side: To assume that the worst situation was one that led to some molten fuel, coupled with loss of containment integrity, and ask: what then? Does radioactivity get out in great enough quantities, into enough lungs? That’s essentially the TMI situation, and I concluded that it led to the TMI outcome: a disaster for the plant owner, but a wholly tolerable situation radiologically. We’re going to have to go back and apply a wider range of conditions to that analysis.But radiation must still be treated like any other variable, and not the ultimate injury. It should not outrank death by inhalation of coal particles, for example. The obsessive fascination with radiation as the worst possible danger leads to mass evacuation as the most conservative response. I don’t know any experienced disaster manager who agrees that mass evacuation is always a conservative response.http://theenergycollective.com/barrybrook/53871/fukushima-18-march-morning-updates-radiation-and-tsunamis"
292,Purush,18 Mar 2011 22:43 ,"Folks, thanks for all the explanations and links. Much appreciated.Looks like the situation is bad, but not really the doomsday scenario projected in the media.Worst case: if a massive explosion that can eject/disperse a large tonnage of radioactive debris into the atmosphere seems imminent, is it not better instead to actively induce/hasten a meltdown and let the molten fuel sink into the concrete catchment block beneath the reactor vessel (if it burns through even the steel containment) and cool/solidify gradually? Definitely not a good option by itself, but undeniably the lesser of the two evils..entrapping in concrete vs spreading it in the atmosphere(?)."

The point is when you cannot pump it but you throw it or spray it ice maybe better because I have better control over the trajectory. Again there could be practical difficulties. ie logistics. But I assume in this situation cost is not an issue. Make ice and take them closer in military air craft. Probably there are some industry scale ice making factories already in Japan.

297,ramana,18 Mar 2011 23:12 ,"Purush, From the report posted by SureshP, there is no chance of any meltdown from the reactor fuel in any of the reactors. And per that expert the fuel in TMI (a PWR) melted only 5/8 inch of five inch steel vessel wall. In this case there is no meltdown as the reactor had coolant pumped to it. All damage to date is to the secondary containment due to hydrogen explosions.The situation is bad for the spent fuel where there is lack of coolant. And they are working to take care of it."
298,Amber G.,18 Mar 2011 23:12 ,"Shivji - As we have said many times before, there is no chance of fission for the spent fuel.  The energy (that comes off as  heat) is due to radioactivity..the amount is of the order of 10KW per TON of the material... simple calculation shows,  that heat produced by it for the whole day per TON  is still about a MILLION  time less than a nuke using just a few Kg of Pu. .. so while the thread of Fuel rods igniting is serious it is no where near a 'nuke bomb'.Wrt to ice /water - as people have pointed out, latent heat of water (it takes about 320000 joule of energy to convert (aka melt)  1Kg of ice (at 0C) to 1Kg of water (at 0C).. but there is no  practical way that   running water (or things immersed in water) can be replaced by ice for  routine cooling purpose.   The suggestion of ice, (IMO)  is emergency  (temporary) measure for these fuel rods. The dumping of ice has   merit if a) the ice is easily available and b) one can deliver it (Eg   Bade said, if Helicopters can dump it) by dropping it in the existing pool of water. Helicopters would need less number of trips before they restore  the pumping of water."

313,SureshP,19 Mar 2011 04:03 ,"Japan raises nuclear alert level By Richard BlackEnvironment correspondent, BBC NewsAs it was almost bound to do at some point, Japan's nuclear safety agency has uprated its assessment of the Fukushima power station incident from a level four to a level five.These are categories on the International Nuclear and Radiological Events Scale (INES), which runs from zero (nothing happened, essentially) to seven, a ""major accident"".So far, Chernobyl is the only seven-rated incident in nuclear history.Level five is defined as an ""accident with wider consequences"".So what is the worst-case scenario for those ""wider consequences"" at Fukushima?What clues are there either from that level five rating, or from the situation on the ground, as to how things might transpire - whether it will in the end prove to have been a disaster or a distraction from the serious and widespread impact of the tsunami?""The worst-case scenario would be where you have the fission products in stored canisters or in the reactors being released,"" said Professor Malcolm Sperrin, director of medical physics and clinical engineering at Royal Berkshire Hospital, UK.""Radiation levels would then be very high around the plant, which is not to say they'd reach the general public.""And we're definitely not in the situation where we're going to see another Chernobyl - that possibility has long gone.""Distant adviceThe level five rating applies specifically to the nuclear reactors in buildings 2 and 3 at Fukushima, rather than to the spent fuel cooling ponds that have lost water and where the stored fuel is heating up.That implies that the regulators believe the main source of radioactivity coming from the plant has been the reactors.Certainly, one of the the spikes in readings earlier in the week appeared to co-incide with damage to reactor number 2, believed to be a crack in the containment system - the symptoms being a sharp release of steam and an abrupt drop in pressure.On Thursday and Friday, radiation levels around the plant appeared much more stable.And although elevated readings have been noted in some locations 30km from Fukushima, there has been nothing outside the 30km protection zone that has appeared to pose a danger to health.Despite this, a number of governments have advised their citizens to stay much further away - or in the case of the UK, to consider doing so.However, when the UK's chief scientific adviser explained the reasoning to BBC News on Thursday, he was still painting a worst-case scenario that appeared some way short of apocalyptic.""The worst-case scenario would see the ponds starting to emit serious amounts of radiation, with some of the reactors going into a meltdown phase,"" he said.""We put that together with [a possible scenario of] extremely unfavourable weather conditions - wind in the direction of Tokyo, for example.""Even in that situation, the radiation that we believe could come into the Tokyo area is such that you could mitigate it with relatively straightforward measures, for example staying indoors and keeping the windows closed.""Local issueFukushima now becomes the third level five incident in half a century of nuclear power.The first was the Windscale reactor fire in the UK in 1957 - the second, the partial meltdown of a reactor at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979.Richard Wakeford from the Dalton Nuclear Institute, a visiting professor in epidemiology at the University of Manchester, recently re-assessed the effect of radiation released at Windscale.Using data and computer models, his scientific paper concluded that the release could have caused about 240 cases of cancer, half of them fatal.However, inquiries into Three Mile Island concluded it probably caused no deaths.That raises the question of why both are in the same INES category, given that Three Mile Island did not, in the end, have more than a local impact.""The reason why Three Mile Island was rated a five is that there was major damage to the reactor core and there was potential for a widespread release of radioactive material - it didn't happen, but that potential is built into the event scale,"" said Professor Wakeford.In terms of material released, he said: ""Fukushima is somewhere between the two - clearly there have been releases, and you have a possible breach of the containment system - no-one really knows.""Slow downAs time passes, the reactors should in principle become less dangerous.The rate at which they pump out heat decreases quickly, and by now the rate should be down to about one-thousandth of what it was a week ago, just before the Tohoku earthquake triggered a shutdown.Prospects of exposure to perhaps the most dangerous radioactive substance, iodine-131, also diminish rapidly.It decays quickly through radioactivity - after eight days, half the atoms present initially will already have decayed away. There should be very little left in fuel rods that have been in storage ponds since November.In addition, the continuing efforts to keep seawater flowing into reactors 1, 2 and 3 appear to have been relatively successful on Thursday and Friday. If the reactors have been cooled, fuel rods will have been degrading at a slower rate, again curbing the release of radioactive substances.On Friday afternoon, radioactivity readings had reportedly declined to less than 500 microsieverts per hour on site - below the level at which operators have to sound the alarm.Nevertheless, computer simulations by the French Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) indicate that harmful levels of radioactivity could have been experienced close to Fukushima but outside the 30km protection zone - though not further afield.Greenpeace, with a long history of opposition to nuclear power, is not convinced that the time has come to declare that the risk of a major accident has subsided.The group's nuclear campaigner Jan Beranek outlined a scenario where radioactive material was dispersed through fires or gas explosions of the type we saw earlier in the week.""The mechanism could be destruction of the cladding around the fuel rods and fire - leading not only to the relase of radioactive iodine and caesium, but also opening fuel rods to the air,"" he told BBC News.""With the fuel ponds, there is no barrier to further release.""With the reactors, you could have a steam or hydrogen explosion if they try to pour water too quickly, and another explosion could give the final blow to the containment.""Hooking upThe cure for the plant's immediate problems could be the restoration of electrical power. A grid connection was hooked up on Friday, although technicians were clearly struggling to power up systems around the site given that some of the plant's internal circuitry had been damaged by the tsunami or the gas explosions.The nuclear safety authority outlined a timescale that would see power restored in reactor buildings 1-4 by Sunday.If this all works, the prospects of the Greenpeace scenario should recede.Then it will be time to take stock. And it may turn out, said Richard Wakeford, that no deaths at all will be attributable to the Fukushima incident.""If you take one of the workers who's been exposed to 100 milliSieverts (mSv), that's not going to have any serious short-term effects,"" he said - ""certainly nothing like the situation facing the Chernobyl emergency workers that killed 28 of them.""The risk of a serious cancer arising from that kind of dose would be less than 1% in a lifetime - and you have to consider that the normal chance of dying from cancer is 20-25% anyway.""As for people outside the plant - I can't see any chance of picking out the effect of the Fukushima releases against the general background of cancers.""World's worst nuclear incidentsLevel 7: Chernobyl, Ukraine, 1986 - explosion and fire in operational reactor, fallout over thousands of square kilometres, possible 4,000 cancer casesLevel 6: Kyshtym, Russia, 1957 - explosion in waste tank leading to hundreds of cancer cases, contamination over hundreds of square kilometresLevel 5: Windscale, UK, 1957 - fire in operating reactor, release of contamination in local area, possible 240 cancer casesLevel 5: Three Mile Island, US, 1986 - instrument fault leading to large-scale meltdown, severe damage to reactor coreLevel 5: Fukushima, 2011 - tsunami and possibly earthquake damage from seismic activity beyond plant design, leading to...?http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12789749"

Reactor 4 does not have fuel in its core....These three reactors contain about 200 metric tons of lightly enriched uranium; reactor 3 also contains plutonium fuel. The cores are beginning to melt. In a full meltdown, this molten fuel could drip down, burning through the steel reactor vessel and possibly breaching the concrete containment vessel --...Photos of the plant show that a series of hydrogen gas explosions has blown off the sides and roofs and compromised the integrity of several structures. The containment walls at reactors 2 and 3 were damaged and may have been breached. Primary and backup cooling systems are not working at reactors 1, 2, and 3. Radioactive steam appears to be leaking from these buildings. These reactor buildings also store spent fuel rods in large pools -- containing several times as much radioactive material as the reactors themselves. Two of these pools have been damaged, and the vital water that was cooling the spent fuel has drained. Without water, these fuel rods will begin to overheat, and the rods' coverings could catch fire. There are 1,760 metric tons of spent fuel in these ponds (with an additional 1,000 tons in the nearby reactor 5 and 6 complex).The ponds contain many billions of curies of radiation that could easily exceed those associated with the reactor cores by a factor of five to 10. They have no containment structures, and radioactive smoke from these fires would spew directly into the atmosphere. Efforts by Japanese military and police to refill the ponds with water dropped from helicopters or by water cannons appear to have failed.The biggest worry is that a spent fuel fire could contaminate the immediate area so badly that reactor workers would no longer be able to keep working to cool the overheating reactors. Then two scenarios will unfold, both far worse than authorities imagined just seven days ago.The best worst-case scenario is that only two spent fuel ponds -- at reactors 3 and 4 -- catch fire and that the meltdowns at reactors 1, 2, and 3 are largely contained by the concrete walls surrounding the reactors. Toxic smoke would still spread massive amounts of radioactive contamination over the surrounding environment.The worst worst-case scenario is that all three reactors with fuel in their core and all four fuel pools overheat and two or more reactors breach the concrete containment structures, burning through into the broader environment.In either case, severe amounts of radioactive contamination will spread over tens, hundreds, or even thousands of square miles. In either case, radioactive contamination will spread over land and water, posing serious health hazards to life within 50 miles of the complex...."

The first time she offered to make idli, the usual skeptical me was watching out of the corner of my eye .(err, you forgot to add salt, you need to add water to the pressure cooker kind ) and when she was about to put the weight on the pressure cooker for the idli, I gave up and said enough.She does try her hand in cooking though.The maid left an extra packet of milk in the freezer to preserve it and next morning, SHQ woke up before me and put the frozen lump of milk/ice in the milk cooker (the one which you fill water)  and then when I woke up, made some tea for me from that milk in the milk cooker. Now this is a quick quiz . What did that tea taste like ?Hint : Like it was made out of burnt milk that it actually was. The reason the milk got burnt is exactly what your post is about!  Ice is a terrible conductor and the layer of liquid milk in contact with hot surface was simply burnt, because there was too little of it to remove the heat . So anyone thinking of adding solid ice (a slushy liquid/ice melt should be fine though) to the hot rods in the containment pool will do exactly what SHQ did with the milk. The aim is to prevent the cladding from melting. This will do little to prevent it.  The survival technique they always teach you when lost in snowy weather is to build a snow cave kind of thing and crawl in,precisely because of that , you will remain warm, while if you are in exposed weather, you will quickly freeze."

Yukio Edano, the chief cabinet secretary, said that the radioactivity contained in the average amount of spinach and milk consumed during an entire year would be equal to the amount received in a single CAT scan. Mr. Edano said that abnormal amounts of radioactivity were found only in these two products, though other foods were tested.... The milk that contained higher levels of radioactive material was tested at farms about 19 miles from the hobbled nuclear plants in Fukushima Prefecture. The spinach was found in Ibaraki Prefecture farther south.“These levels do not pose an immediate threat to your health,” Mr. Edano said, adding that the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry would provide additional details. “Please stay calm.”...In a separate news conference, Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa said that temperatures outside the four hobbled nuclear reactors in Fukushima were lower than expected, but he was unable to confirm how hot it was inside the damaged buildings, leaving open the possibility that nuclear fuel may still be overheating.Temperatures were below 212 degrees Fahrenheit based on readings taken by firefighters from the Japan Self-Defense Force that drove trucks with water cannons to within about 60 feet of the No. 3 reactor on Friday....Late Friday, Tokyo Electric Power Company finished running a high-power transmission line about a mile meters to buildings that house the damaged reactors. About 500 workers from the company were trying on Saturday to use the power line to restart the systems used to cool the reactors.The National Police Agency said on Saturday that there were nearly 7,200 confirmed deaths so far, and nearly 11,000 people remained missing.

339,SureshP,20 Mar 2011 02:53 ,"A Day of Progress at Troubled Nuclear PlanFire-fighting crews from Tokyo resumed pumping seawater into the No. 3 reactor building of the stricken Fukushima Dai-1 Nuclear Power Station Saturday morning. A new round of pumping was planned for the afternoon. Meanwhile, power company worker have been working around the clock laying cables from the electricity grid to the plant and then to the six reactors. During the day, they reported some success in restoring power, essential for operating the reactors' and spent fuel pools’ cooling systems.A morning operation conducted by fire fighters sent from Tokyo poured 60 metric tons of water into the No. 3 reactor building, aiming to refill the spent fuel storage pool that lost water after power failed following the 11 March earthquake and  tsunami. Without power to drive water circulation the still-radioactive spent fuel will gradually heat up and evaporate the water. NHK, Japan’s national broadcaster, reported the water injection operation took 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) crews worked to bring in power from an outside Tohoku Electric Power Co. electricity grid line to a reserve transformer located some distance from the plant. The idea is to use the transformer to provide electricity for the plant. The crews then laid down cable in a circuitous route around debris caused by explosions that have damaged the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors. The cable had to be laid down in two stages of 550 meters and 930 meters before the crews were able to connect it to a temporary transformer installed next to the No. 1 reactor.An NHK expert following events at the plant said this part of the operation was completed Friday night. He added that TEPCO expected to finish installing a link from the temporary transformer to the transformer for the No. 2 reactor by Saturday morning. But high radiation is hampering the crew and the work was still ongoing Saturday afternoon. The No. 2 reactor is considered to be in a dangerous state after an earlier hydrogen explosion is believed to have damaged the suppression pool, or torus, which is connected to the primary containment vessel where nuclear fission takes place. The torus serves a safety function: If pressure rises too high in the pressure vessel, operators can vent steam into the torus through a series of relief valves. Pressure in the vessel is reported to be down since the explosion.A Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency official said in a press conference Saturday morning that because the No. 2 reactor building “isn’t damaged (by the explosion) it’s difficult to inject water into it from outside. So it is necessary to restore the cooling system by repairing the power station.” He added that about 20 people are working on this reactor. But radiation is hampering progress. Radiation of 10 millisieverts per hour had been measured outside No. 1 reactor and 15 millisieverts per hour outside No. 2 reactor.One hundred millisieverts had been the maximum amount of radiation a worker should be exposed to during one stint. But Saturday morning a company official said that it had now raised the maximum level to 150 millisieverts because of the emergency.But not all the news on radiation was bad. Gregory Hartl, an official with the World Health Organization, commented on the endangered plant in Geneva Friday. “Outside the 30 km radius there have been very low levels of radiation measured.” He added that “the evidence so far (with) the radiation levels measured would say there is little public health danger from the radiation there.”More positive news came during the day when NHK reported that other TEPCO repair groups were using existing cables at the plant to link reactors 3, 4, 5 and 6 to power sources outside the plant. Later that afternoon a Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency official announced that Tepco workers had used an emergency diesel generator to restore some power to the No. 5 reactor and No. 6 reactor buildings. It had been reported earlier that the water in the spent fuel storage pools had been heating up there, as well.The situation brightened further when around 2 p.m. an unmanned Tokyo fire truck with a 22-meter water tower began shooting a stream of seawater—at a rate of 3 tons a minute—into the No. 3 reactor building. The truck was connected by a 300- meter hose to second truck positioned near the ocean that used a high-pressure pump to provide it with water. NHK reported the operation would continue for seven hours. Providing the operation continues without interruption, some 1200 tons of seawater would be jetted into the building. The spent fuel storage pool is rated to hold 1200 tons of water, according to NHK.Kazuaki Matsu, executive managing director of the Institute of Applied Energy, an independent organization in Tokyo, told Spectrum that even if they were to fill only one third of the pool, it would probably be enough to cover the top of the spent fuel rods. “For purposes of cooling the rods about one-third would be sufficient. But for radiation shielding purpose, 1200 would be perfect.”Several hours after the operation began, government officials announced the operation was going smoothly. In a press conference held at 3:30 p.m. Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa showed dramatic video of the Self-Defense fire trucks taking part in yesterday’s operation. A video camera was mounted in one of the trucks and showed another truck parked within 20 to 30 meters of the No. 3 reactor pumping water into the building. The video showed shattered walls, mangled broken pipes and mangled steel bars once used to reinforce the concrete walls.IEEE"

In Britain, we'd shriek 'health and safety'A helicopter hovers over the nuclear power plant at Fukushima, dropping gallons of sea water over an exposed reactor – this was the unnerving image that was broadcast to the western world this morning. But how many of us paused to imagine the crew inside? For the good of their country, those military men and scientists were risking exposure to dangerous clouds of radioactive steam.There is an explanation for this admirable stoicism demonstrated by the Japanese, but it’s pretty un-PC, and it’s bound to elicit a snarky email from some right-on SOAS academic. It’s called Yamato-damashii – or “Japanese spirit”. Then, while assessing the history of the Samurai, Griffis comments:  “History reveals a state of society in which cool determination, desperate courage and fearlessness of death in the face of duty were quite unique, and which must have had their base in some powerful though abnormal code of ethics.”Is there something in that, even today? The determination and courage of those battling a failing nuclear power plant would suggest so. That SOAS academic might accuse me of subscribing to old-fashioned orientalism, but to me there is something singularly Japanese about how they are responding to these disasters.Human element to the natural disaster in Japan."

349,SureshP,20 Mar 2011 18:51 ,"Stabilisation at Fukushima Daiichi 20 March 2011 Workers on site have succeeded in increasing the stability of the Fukushima Daiichi reactor units. Pressure built up within unit 3 but a more significant venting now seems unnecessary. External power has now been connected to unit 5 and 6, allowing them to use their residual heat removal systems and transfer heat to the sea. This is being used to cool the fuel ponds and bring the units towards cold shutdown status. Fuel pond temperatures have reduced from 68ºC to 43ºC at unit 5 and from 57ºC to 52ºC at unit 6, compared to normal operating temperatures of about 25ºC.An extended operation to refill the fuel pond took place at unit 3, with the Hyper Rescue crew spraying for over 13 hours. Radiation levels 500 metres north of the reactor showed a decrease from 3.44 millisieverts per hour to 2.75 millisieverts per hour, indicating a measure of success in refilling the pond. A similar operation is planned for later today at unit 4 and the surface temperatures of the buildings appear to be below 100ºC.At units 1 and 2, external power has been restored. Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said it would restore functions in the central control room shared by the units so that accurate readings could again be taken from the reactor system. Next, workers will check the condition of the water supply systems to the reactor and the used fuel pond. With luck these will be able to go back into operation as they had been immediately after the earthquake on 11 March.External power for units 3 and 4 should be in place 'in a few days time', said Tepco. During the day, the company had noted a pressure increase within unit 3, warning that venting may be required. Preparations were underway to open the relief vale on the torus suppression chamber, or if that had proven full of water, another valve on the reactor containment. These operations had been expected to release a more significant amount of radioactivity than earlier venting, but Tepco has since said the higher pressure is stable and it does not need to vent.Radiation monitors in the area near the plant have shown gradually decreasing readings since spikes on 15 March following the loud noises and apparent rupture of the torus of unit 2. While levels were above natural background radiation they have not posed a threat to public health. Most people within 20 kilometres were evacuated before that time and people in a further ten-kilometre radius has been warned to stay indoors. Evacuation centres have been supplied with potassium iodide tablets that would protect people's thyroid glands in the case of a serious release of radionuclides from the reactor cores.Despite contradictory comments by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to US politicians and media, most observers in nuclear industry and regulation consider the measures taken by Japanese authorities to be prudent.Researched and written by World Nuclear NewsWorld Nuclear News"

Of the 11, two were found to have been exposed to radiation and are receiving treatment.AdditionallyThe 16th anniversary of the Aum Shinrikyo cult’s deadly 1995 sarin nerve gas attacks was commemorated Sunday at the Tokyo subway’s Kasumigaseki Station.A moment of silence was observed by 21 Tokyo Metro Co employees at 8 a.m., around the same time that the attacks occurred.

359,chaanakya,21 Mar 2011 00:32 ,"disha , I do believe that nuk power is  safe to a considerable extent. But you would also ack that there are legit concerns.As long as better and cost effective alternatives are available, Nuclear power would not gain much public acceptance, unless issues are addressed in an open and transparent manner to a large audience. My reading report would perhaps help me   Call it irrational or self preservation or selfish approach.There has to be an argument in favor of Nuclear plant as opposed to other alternatives. What are the advantages that nuk choice only has to be adopted and no other choice is viable.Links in earlier post.The study suggests policy scenario for US Govt and why nuk option should be retained. However some of the quotes I find go against the conclusion if basic assumptions are removed.Four points are cost, safety proliferation and waste disposal. It is being juxtaposed as cleaner alternative if carbon emission is a big factor (i.e. global warming).Today, nuclear power is not an economically competitive choice. Moreover,unlike other energy technologies, nuclear power requires significant govern-ment involvement because of safety, proliferation, and waste concerns. Expanded deployment of nuclear power requires public acceptance of thisenergy source. Our review of survey results shows that a majority ofAmericans and Europeans oppose building new nuclear power plants to meetfuture energy needs. To understand why, we surveyed 1350 adults in the USabout their attitudes toward energy in general and nuclear power in particu-lar. Three important and unexpected results emerged from that survey:The U.S. public’s attitudes are informed almost entirely by their perceptionsof the technology, rather than by politics or by demographics such asincome, education, and gender.The U.S. public’s views on nuclear waste, safety, and costs are critical to theirjudgments about the future deployment of this technology. Technologicalimprovements that lower costs and improve safety and waste problems canincrease public support substantially.In the United States, people do not connect concern about global warmingwith carbon-free nuclear power. There is no difference in support for build-ing more nuclear power plants between those who are very concerned aboutglobal warming and those who are not. Public education may help improveunderstanding about the link between global warming, fossil fuel usage, andthe need for low-carbon energy sources.There are two implications of these findings for our study: first, the U.S. pub-lic is unlikely to support nuclear power expansion without substantialimprovements in costs and technology. Second, the carbon-free character ofnuclear power, the major motivation for our study, does not appear to moti-vate the U.S. general public to prefer expansion of the nuclear option.Nuclear power will succeed in the long run only if it has a lower cost thancompeting technologies.Because of the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986,a great deal of attention has focused on reactor safety. However, the safetyrecord of reprocessing plants is not good, and there has been little safetyanalysis of fuel cycle facilities using, for example, the probabilistic risk assess-ment method.The management and disposal of high-level radioactive spent fuel from thenuclear fuel cycle is one of the most intractable problems facing the nuclearpower industry throughout the world. No country has yet successfully imple-mented a system for disposing of this waste.our study postulates a global growth scenario that bymid-century would see 1000 to 1500 reactors of 1000 megawatt-electric(MWe) capacity each deployed worldwide, compared to a capacity equivalentto 366 such reactors now in service. Nuclear power expansion on this scalerequires U.S. leadership, continued commitment by Japan,Korea, and Taiwan, a renewal of European activity, andwider deployment of nuclear power around the world. At least for the next few decades, there are only a few realistic options for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation:increase efficiency in electricity generation and use;expand use of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal;capture carbon dioxide emissions at fossil-fueled (especially coal) electric generating plants and permanently sequester the carbon; andincrease use of nuclear power.Unfortunately Fukushima has prised open the debate and tilted it in favour of Anti nuk group. Where as one can argue equally plausibly that fukushima demonstrated  highest safety standard and skilfull management of disaster due to tsunami and quake. But for that plant would have functioned normally. Unit one was supposed to be de commissioned soon.Perhaps It is time for India to review its nuclear policy ( I know I am opening  pandora's box)  and look for indigenously developed nuk cycle which uses natural uranium   +FBR +  BR +thorium in three stage - closed cycle mode rather than open cycle as recommended in above report.Gurus can only debate these points.For Guruprabhu.added bold part later to make it clear, I hope.

Relatively high levels were also found in spinach from Tochigi and Gunma Prefectures to the west, canola from Gunma Prefecture and chrysanthemum greens from Chiba Prefecture, south of Ibaraki.The emergency efforts to mitigate damage at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, meanwhile, brought some notes of relief in the face of persistently dire conditions. The authorities said they had restored water pumps to two damaged reactors, Nos. 5 and 6, that were not of central concern, putting them under control in a state known as “cold shutdown.”But another reactor that has proved more worrisome, No. 3, continued to bedevil engineers.The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the plant, appeared to have experienced a serious setback as officials said that pressure buildup at the ravaged No. 3 reactor would require the venting of more radioactive gases.But at a news conference a few hours later, officials from the power company said that the pressure had stabilized and that they had decided they did not need to release the gases immediately, which would have heightened worries about wider contamination among the population. They said they were unsure what had caused the pressure to rise, highlighting the uncertainty engineers must still grapple with at Fukushima.The power company also said that on Sunday workers injected 40 tons of water into the storage pool containing spent fuel rods at Unit No. 2, and that firefighters began spraying water into the pool at Unit No. 4. On Saturday, firefighters sprayed water at the storage pool of Unit No. 3 for more than 13 hours.The reactors placed in cold shutdown were already shut down before the earthquake and the tsunami struck on March 11, posing less of a risk than the other reactors at the plant. But their cooling systems were knocked out, and the fuel rods left inside the reactors started to heat up, together with spent fuel rods in a separate storage pool.“We are getting closer to bringing the situation under control,” Tetsuro Fukuyama, the deputy chief cabinet secretary of the Japanese government, said of the entire plant late Sunday.After connecting a mile-long electrical transmission line on Saturday, workers made progress in starting to restore power to the plant, which may allow the operator to restart its cooling systems. The government said that power was returned to Reactor No. 2 at 3:46 p.m. Sunday, and that other reactors were also expected to gain power early in the week.Even with electrical power extended to the reactors, there was no immediate indication from officials that the damaged pumping systems could be quickly restored....Workers were trying to avoid further damage to fuel rods in the reactor cores of Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and to prevent rods in the storage pools of Nos. 2, 3 and 4 from overheating.Some experts project that the longer it takes to resolve the crisis fully, the greater the chances that one or more reactors or fuel storage pools will have to be abandoned, increasing the risk of a catastrophic release of radiation.The plant remains a hazardous place for the emergency crews trying to stave off further damage. At least 25 workers and five members of the Japanese Self-Defense Force have been exposed to unsafe amounts of radiation, according to the power company. At least 20 workers and four self-defense soldiers have been injured, and two workers remain missing....Mr. Fukuyama, the deputy chief cabinet secretary, stressed that although the readings were above levels deemed normal, they posed no immediate health risks.“At current levels, I would let my children eat the spinach and drink the water” from Fukushima, he said. His children did not drink much milk,    he added....Spinach from a farm in Hitachi, about 45 miles from the plant, contained 27 times the amount of iodine that is generally considered safe, while cesium levels were about four times higher than is deemed safe by Japan. Meanwhile, raw milk from a dairy farm in Iitate, about 18 miles from the plant, contained iodine levels that were 17 times higher than those considered safe, and milk had cesium levels that were slightly above amounts considered safe...."

But I think in the Indian context the point in the quote above doesn't get the real situation. Let me explain why.With the huge power deficit in India, we need to move on all fronts in power generation. And that includes dirty coal fired plants, hydel, nuclear as well as wind and solar. We can't afford to cherry pick on what type of generation we are going to concentrate on. We could have done that if we were either power sufficient or power surplus nation.The problem with misinformed knee jerk sensationalism that goes under the name of analytical reporting is that it is trying to tell us that this accident shows nuclear is ""haram"" (the subtext is LWR is the most ""haram"", particularly US maal, but never mind) and so don't touch it and instead go for coal and every thing else but don't touch Nuclear with a bargepole.That is patently a red herring and wrong. So while we can't look at a future (from India's perspective, I mean) where the only generation method is nuclear, until there's a substantive technological breakthroughs, we can't also think in terms of excluding nuclear and still attain sustainable power self-sufficiency.Look at Fukushima from a different perspective. You have a 40 year old nuclear power plant built with GenI tech when we're already in GenIII. Yet in a Black Swan event of a massive earthquake and an unprecedented tsunami the plant and the reactors just didn't crumble and all the rods spill out. The problem started because the power supply was washed away, which was more a case of wrong positioning from a civil engineering perspective rather than a design issue.Heck Japan lost 15,000 people in just the Miyagi prefecture, that's several orders of magnitude more than the total number of deaths that has occurred throughout the world due to nuclear power generation accidents.Let's keep a sense of perspective."

The US can afford to take its time to decide what mode of power generation it undertakes because it is, as far as I know, power surplus nation and its economy is stable/stagnant and so there's no massive hike in demand for power.

Let me know.Bro, you miss the point. And that is just because something is banned or stopped doesn't mean that anyone consuming that would die or sustain permanent damage. That's the whole point. What Cox is saying is that the radiation found is not at harmful levels for humans. However, Japan has one of the world's highest safety standards in food. And hence its a precaution.

406,chaanakya,21 Mar 2011 20:39 ,"http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/21/japan.radiation.food.risk/index.html(CNN) -- Japan's alarm over radiation found in spinach and milk has also raised questions, given that little is known about its effect on the human body.While some tests have been done on animals, sparse information is available on how eating contaminated food affects people in the short and long term.The main reason is the lack of research subjects, limited to those affected by the 1945 nuclear attacks on the Japanese cities of NagasDr. James Cox, an oncology professor at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said he believes the radiation levels measured in these products pose a ""nonexistent"" immediate risk to humans, and ""very low"" long-term risk.Still, he concedes that ""radiation doses ingested through food is really very poorly understood.""Dr. James Cox, an oncology professor at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said he believes the radiation levels measured in these products pose a ""nonexistent"" immediate risk to humans, and ""very low"" long-term risk.Still, he concedes that ""radiation doses ingested through food is really very poorly understood.""While studies were conducted in Japan after World War II, experts today are cautious to draw definitive conclusions on how the consumption of radiation-tainted food after the atomic bombings affected people. That is mostly because the research didn't focus as much on the thyroid gland and the presence of specific radioactive isotopes in food.Iodine-131 differs from regular iodine because it is radioactive. It collects in the human thyroid gland because the thyroid readily absorbs iodine and assumes the iodine-131 strain is like any other form, said Cox, an expert on the effects of radiation on the survivors of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.The thyroid produces some of the body's most important hormones, which play a role in functions such as food metabolism and regulation of body temperature. To fight off iodine-131, doctors typically prescribe iodine pills that fill up the thyroid so there's no more room and force the iodine-131 out of the body.Residents -- including many children -- drank milk contaminated with Chernobyl-produced iodine-131, said Cox. And experts believe this milk consumption contributed to cases of cancer, though it is notable that radiation contaminated other types of food as well.The lack of access to iodine pills is less of a problem now. Cox says it might not be a bad idea for residents near Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant to take these pills as a precaution, despite their potentially harmful side effects, including allergic skin reactions and kidney damage.""It might be a prudent thing to do, especially for the kids right around Fukushima,"" he said.Iodine's eight-day half-life -- the time it takes for a radioactive isotope to decay by half -- means that in eight days, half of its radioactivity level will disappear. By contrast, cesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years, so it lingers for much longer. But even less is known on the impact of cesium-137, among other isotopes, when consumed by humans in food.Experts do know that direct radiation exposure (without a conduit like food or water) can be deadly. Large doses of airborne exposure can cause death as soon as a few days. Lower degrees of exposure may result in heightened risk for developing cancer later in life, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Generally, health risks from radiation exposure can range from skin reddening to cancer and death, according to the CDC. Damage depends on the type of radiation, how much radiation the body has absorbed, the way the person was exposed to the radiation, and the length of time a person was exposed.As for the consumption of radiation-contaminated food, Cox said the studies indicate that cancer rates are higher for those who eat and drink such products than for the general population. Yet it is hard to draw hard-and-fast conclusions, especially since those who might drink contaminated milk around Chernobyl, for instance, might be exposed to radiation in other ways as well.There's little evidence, too, that consuming radiation-contaminated food will cause genetic mutations that can be passed on to one's offspring.""There's always an assumption that there would be a genetic risk, but that has never been shown in humans,"" said Cox."

Hours after the first shock waves hit, two of the largest crime groups went into action, opening their offices to those stranded in Tokyo, and shipping food, water, and blankets to the devastated areas in two-ton trucks and whatever vehicles they could get moving. The day after the earthquake the Inagawa-kai (the third largest organized crime group in Japan which was founded in 1948) sent twenty-five four-ton trucks filled with paper diapers, instant ramen, batteries, flashlights, drinks, and the essentials of daily life to the Tohoku region. An executive in Sumiyoshi-kai, the second-largest crime group, even offered refuge to members of the foreign community—something unheard of in a still slightly xenophobic nation, especially amongst the right-wing yakuza. The Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan’s largest crime group, under the leadership of Tadashi Irie, has also opened its offices across the country to the public and been sending truckloads of supplies, but very quietly and without any fanfare."

(I did write to NYTimes but the  that reporter kept  reporting from NY times for a long time).All: In any case, my point was ""2 + 2"" , even if it reported as ""LARGE TWOS"" by NY times, or presented with reporters  of CNN, prominently displaying their   dosimeters (and hazmat suits), and confusing  everyone with their expert opinions (2 is 2000 millis or 2000000 micros) ..still does not become 5000. That NY times story (which I also linked) was irresponsible, specially where it gave out the numbers of thousands of deaths without mentioning that the number was due to Tsunami/quake and not due to radiation leak.Other stories (Eg one from daily mail posted by me earlier and later by others) ...with  all qualifiers like"" ""high/serious/dangerous/can kill"" etc.. should be understood (at least by responsible people) in quantitative terms.And the ""experts"" are  NOT talking in  vacuum..I remember all the sensational stories about TMI.. but still with all the studies which has taken place, when all is said and done, number of   deaths (including cancer in local population in last 30 years) attributed to solely radiation is ZERO... (Nuclear reactors have been in use all over the world for many decades, so safety  data is not really a CT theory) The same remains true, for now, with Japan. As Guru Prabhu pointed out, with whole trains being washed out,  with tens of thousands victims of Tsunamui and Earhtquake,  it is highly irresponsible to keep fixated on dosimeter  wearing  Anderson Cooper's  type proclamations...Chances that a person  will die  of radiation (if he/she indeed gulps about 1500 TONS of that tainted  milk  which is being watched anyway) is rather remote.   but then why let facts interfere with narrative???/sigh/"

It is very irresponsible to associate one with other.FWIW,  but I hope this is useful:- . Hiroshima, primarily destruction was due to explosion (>10KT), fire etc. (98% deaths - best estimations give about 2% deaths due to cancer because of radioactivity) -  Chernobyl,  OTOH, spewed out 100X radioactivity (compared to Atomic Bomb), but explosive power was only about 0.01 KT.. Majority of deaths (about 50) were due to high radiation absorbed by fire-fighters etc... (Rest, a few thousands - over 20 odd years)  For perspective the radiation measured  >10,000,000 milirems/hr - compared with 50-250 mRem  normally allowed  by NPP workers for a yearly dose - Ld50 dose is 300,000-450,000 mRem) (Numbers put in this way are more helpful IMO)    Nuclear bomb is different than power plant!The difference between Chernobyl and Japan NPP should also be understood:Chernobyl -  about 50 tons of radioactive material spewed out ... NO evacuation for days, people keep eating radioactive food. Japan NPP - Will know accurate data after some time, but we do know, prompt evacuation,  low radiation activity (thousands of time smaller than Chernobyl etc..).Hope this helps."

Results were reportedly published in American Journal of Industrial Medicine. Apparently busts the myth of no deaths  attributed to radiation, but could be wrong. Gyanis living in unkilland can check and tell us mango abdul if this is false.One thing to be noted here is that deaths have occured in place unconnected with the place of accident in time and space unlike train, plane accidents  or tsunami blah blah. But I think reporter's claim surely must be false in the  face of such overwhelming scientific facts. But I would surely get worried if a plant come up in my neighbourhood.http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/MC23Dh02.htmlby Ritt Goldstein According to a 2006 Swedish study published in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine, it appears Sweden experienced approximately a thousand excess cancer fatalities because of Chernobyl, the number expected to increase, the cases concentrated proportional to the levels of radioactive exposure. As might be imagined, there were other health effects as well, such as effects with an impact on unborn children.A 2007 study performed by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a prestigious Cambridge Massachusetts-based think-tank, examined the cognitive effects of Chernobyl's radiation on Swedish children. It found evidence that ""fetal exposure to ionizing radiation damages cognitive ability at radiation levels previously considered safe"".Notably, this journalist lives about a ninety minute drive from Gavle, and I only heard of the cognitive problems through a chance meeting while food shopping. I was told that an unusually high number of pregnancies during the peak radiation period had resulted in children with cognitive issues, the above report suggesting the accuracy of that information. But only some years ago, I personally had lived in Gavle; though, I had no idea of its relationship to Chernobyl until I took up residence there.Initially, one of the places where I had lived was on the shore of a picturesque lake, the village it was in being about a half hour from the city's center. I was struck by how lovely it was, until I learned one couldn't eat the fish, and it wasn't a good idea to do too much swimming, radiation being a problem.Twenty years after Chernobyl, in 2006, Swedish National Television (SVT) did a news piece titled ""Chernobyl still affects Gavle every day"" (Tjernobyl paverkar annu Gavle-vardagen). Among other items, it discusses how wild game is checked for radiation, and how residents now often travel to pick the wild berries or mushrooms that they once collected locally.Who is he to scare common folks with such unconfirmed reports?He goes on to point more unproven sources , that too from Greenpeace a known anti nuk lobby. In contrast to the IAEA's fatality figures, a 2006 Greenpeace report forecast 100,000 cancer fatalities, and a 2010 book by leading Eastern European scientists utilizing original ""Slavic language"" documents (""Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment""), claims a death toll of 985,000.While some uncertainties exist, there are hard facts.Gavle is about 1,600 kilometers from Chernobyl, and the amount of nuclear fuel present at Chernobyl during the 1986 accident is reported as about 180 tons, none of which contained plutonium, an element considerably more toxic than the uranium used in standard reactor fuel. Estimates of the amount of nuclear fuel present at the Fukushima reactors are roughly in the 2000 ton range, dwarfing Chernobyl, and one of the six reactors (number 3) does use a mixture of plutonium and uranium, ""mox"". I do know that Fukushima (reactor no 3 ) had PUMOX containing Plutonium which apparently is more dangerous than even enriched uranium. According to the Nuclear Information Resource Center (NIRS), this plutonium-uranium fuel mixture is far more dangerous than typical enriched uranium -- a single milligram (mg) of MOX is as deadly as 2,000,000 mg of normal enriched uranium.( not sure if this is correct, ahh  sorry for  using color , point doesn't become strong or facts correct just by being in black)Must be wrong, absolutely.  Why should I trust NIRS which I don't even know what it stands for. But I am better eating carbon, doing it for millions of years, Don't people know that CO2 is in air, everytime I exhale it is CO2 and it can be fixed in many ways, ask a botanist. Earlier it used to be CFC and  Methane (what belongs to GHG) for scaring mango abdul in dev countries. But west has become considerably silent when IPCC report about Himalayan Glacier proved wrong. Is it just another stick to beat growing economy with? Ordinary mango abdul in west spews more CO2 due to his lifestyle than others. Yes I know the debate about GDP intensity of energy vs per capita energy consumption . This is what I posed before my Jap friends and they were reluctantly ack it. But that is besides the point.Should they not reduce it. No it is difficult. Selling Nuk Tech is easy and profitable. We have money and we can , now, afford it and we are close to breakthrough in this area and if they don't include us they would loose lucrative market. Same story was there fro CRAY XMP, denied to India , and when super comp was developed by Indian scientists, quietly unkil took it out of banned list. Before someone asks what all this has to do with Fukushima, I have no idea.There was report of cesium 137 which is more toxic and longer radioactive half life  incidentally  it means that the time required  for decaying material to  decrease by half, while remaining half continues to do the dirty work.What it means for us is that we need safer choices and transparency in whole debate not technical jargon and selective quoting  from either side.If facts are wrong please correct it. Much obliged. Else  ignore it."

443,Amber G.,22 Mar 2011 21:54 ,"Sorry, if posted earlier.. little different perspective than most reports...Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear powerYou will not be surprised to hear that the events in Japan have changed my view of nuclear power. You will be surprised to hear how they have changed it. As a result of the disaster at Fukushima, I am no longer nuclear-neutral. I now support the technology.A crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster earthquake and a vast tsunami. The electricity supply failed, knocking out the cooling system. The reactors began to explode and melt down. The disaster exposed a familiar legacy of poor design and corner-cutting. Yet, as far as we know, no one has yet received a lethal dose of radiation.<snip>..If you care to notice, quantitative numbers pretty consistent with what I and (and others too)    have posted here.. eg: ..It shows that the average total dose from the Three Mile Island disaster for someone living within 10 miles of the plant was one 625th of the maximum yearly amount permitted for US radiation workers. This, in turn, is half of the lowest one-year dose clearly linked to an increased cancer risk, which, in its turn, is one 80th of an invariably fatal exposure. I'm not proposing complacency here. I am proposing perspective."
444,SureshP,22 Mar 2011 21:56 ,"The meltdown that wasn'tHow a handful of operators at a crippled reactor averted a greater catastrophe at the Fukushima plant.Geoff Brumfiel The magnitude-9.0 earthquake rocked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station at 2:46 p.m. on 11 March, but the real emergency began an hour later. A wall of water swept across the site, washing away power lines and the fuel tanks for the emergency backup generators designed to take over if grid power failed. Inside the control room of the unit 1 reactor, the lights went out and the 1970s-vintage analogue gauges drifted to zero. It will probably be years before anyone knows exactly what happened inside the three reactors at Fukushima Daiichi that seem to have partially melted down in the wake of the tsunami. But from press reports, public statements and interviews with experts, it is possible to work out the most likely scenario. And already it is clear that decisions made in the initial 24 hours by the handful of operators in the control room probably averted a much greater nuclear catastrophe than the one that now faces Japan.In the moments after the power was lost, the operators ""would have literally been blind"", says Margaret Harding, a nuclear engineer in Wilmington, North Carolina. Harding worked for two decades with General Electric, which designed Fukushima's boiling-water reactors, and she witnessed a similar outage in 1984 during a safety test at a boiling-water reactor in Switzerland. ""Basically the emergency lights came on and all the panels went black,"" Harding says.During the Swiss test, the power returned in 5 minutes. At Fukushima, batteries ran a handful of emergency lights in the control room and a few instruments tracking the reactor's vital signs, such as the pressure inside the core. The core was next door. Inside a large, cube-shaped building, enclosed in a heavy concrete containment vessel, sat a thick, steel capsule filled with around 50 tonnes of uranium. Until an hour previously, that fuel had been pumping out 460 megawatts of power, but the reactor had automatically shut down immediately after the earthquake. Boron–carbon control rods driven between the long columns of fuel had soaked up neutrons and halted the nuclear reactions. Model responseThat didn't mean the reactor was cold. Radioactive by-products of the fission reactions still generated heat — some 7 megawatts of it, preliminary computer models by the National Nuclear Laboratory in Sellafield, UK, suggest. The fuel still needed to be actively cooled.Without power, operators could use steam from the reactor's pressure vessel, plus minimal amounts of battery power, to drive a pump that would keep the cooling water circulating. What they probably didn't know was that the cooling system had sprung a leak. The leak caused water levels inside the core to drop, allowing the fuel to heat up, which generated more steam and raised the pressure inside the steel vessel. The emergency cooling system was unable to cope, according to a press release from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plant's operator. At 7:03 p.m. a state of nuclear emergency was declared. Less than 2 hours later, evacuations began within a 2-kilometre radius of the plant.By 4:00 a.m. the pressure inside the thick steel vessel of unit 1 had reached 840 kilopascals (kPa), more than twice the operating limit, according to the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, the Japanese nuclear regulator. Radiation levels at the front gate of the site had begun to rise above background, although they were still far from dangerous. At 5:44 a.m. the evacuation cordon was expanded to 10 kilometres.At some point, the falling water levels must have left the fuel exposed. In a reactor such as unit 1, the uranium pellets are enclosed in long, skinny pipes made of zirconium alloy, chosen because it does not inhibit the neutrons needed to drive the fission reactions. As temperatures rose above 1,000 °C, the steam in the pressure vessel began to oxidize the zirconium, probably releasing hydrogen gas. Meanwhile, fuel pellets, liberated from their shell, began to fall to the bottom of the reactor. The meltdown had begun.This was the crucial moment. If the operators at unit 1 could not stem the meltdown, the fuel would gather at the bottom of the vessel. The uranium pellets, now in close proximity, could begin exchanging neutrons and resume their heat-producing nuclear reactions. Slowly, the pile could build towards a 'critical mass' that would restart the nuclear process normally used to generate electricity. Turning pointNobody can be sure about this sequence of events because there has never been a full meltdown in a boiling-water reactor. Harding says that she thinks it's unlikely that the nuclear processes would have reignited. Even if they did, the worst case, in her opinion, is that the fuel would have burned through the steel pressure vessel and splattered onto the 'base mat', a thick concrete slab that would have spread out the fuel, extinguishing any fission reactions. But even that might have been catastrophic. The volatile hydrogen gas generated by the zirconium was safe inside the steel pressure vessel, but it was liable to explode if exposed to air in the outer containment vessel. If the blast were big enough, it might have breached the outer vessel's thick, concrete walls. This scenario is highly unlikely, but had it happened, the workers struggling to save the plant would almost certainly have received a lethal dose of radiation, says Malcolm Sperrin, a medical physicist at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, UK. Citizens near the plant could have been at higher risk for cancer later in life, he says. And the contamination would have made emergency operations much more difficult at the other reactors, which were also in trouble. The situation could easily have spiralled out of control.Just metres away was a vast reservoir of sea water. It could stop the reactor's meltdown, but operators had no way to pump it into the core. Emergency generators could not be hooked into the system, for reasons that are still unclear.At some point, somebody on the site realized that fire engines were essentially giant portable pumps with their own power supplies. ""The fire trucks were brilliant,"" Harding says, ""I'm not sure I would have thought of that."" Engines were rushed to the plant and hooked into the lifeless emergency cooling system. Yet there was still a problem: the pressure in the core was too high for the engines' pumps to force in the sea water.Around 2:30 on Saturday afternoon, operators began to vent pressure from the containment vessel. An hour later something sparked the gas that had built up inside the outer building during venting. The entire top of unit 1 was blown away, and four workers were injured, although the sturdy concrete containment vessel below seems to have survived the blast. Chain reactionThe explosion, broadcast around the world, was the first of a series of setbacks at the reactor complex. In the ensuing days, reactors 3 and 2 followed a similar path to unit 1 (see 'An unfolding crisis'); each was rocked by a massive hydrogen explosion. In units 3 and 4, the pools for storing used fuel lost their cooling water and it is believed that the rods began to melt, emitting more explosive hydrogen along with powerful radiation.At the time of writing, radioactive material from Fukushima Daiichi continues to blow across Japan at levels high enough to cause concern for Sperrin — although he says that they are not immediately dangerous. In the coming weeks and months, the government, TEPCO and safety authorities are likely to face heavy criticism. People will ask what went wrong.Still, at unit 1 the immediate crisis has passed. With the pressure down, fire engines began to flood the reactor with sea water at 8:20 p.m. on 12 March, allowing the fuel to slowly cool to a safe temperature. The response at unit 1 also provided a model for stabilizing the other two reactors. And day by day, the radioactive decay in the reactor cores is ebbing. It could be days or weeks before the reactors are truly safe, but for now things remain stable. As for the operators at unit 1, says Harding, ""I think they really did respond pretty well."" Nature"

Partly it was quoted by Mr Ritt which related to Radiation related deaths caused by Chernobyl radiation reaching that little sweden village and also talked about effects on unborn child. Scary indeed. DO you want to say that those studies are either wrong or quoted out of context by the journo?In case you lay your hand on those studies  or if you have a link, do put it here or give me a pointer. Unfortunately I don't have much spare time to visit university and look up the journal, though I will try. WHO report generally takes the position as you are advocating. Since it is a scanned one just can't reproduce without lengthy typing effort.It talks about acceptable risk in radiation and  also underlines the importance of health education programme for general public who may not be privy to what Ray and Nigam had to say.To me it appears that studies are available aplenty after 30/20 years of TML and Cher supporting both  contentions. One  might support or blame pro or anti nuk lobby and that leaves ordinary people confused. One can't really rely on so called expert studies either way since there are conflicting conclusions . Best course ,then appears to be preventive or precaution, that is no nuk in my backyard.MIT report also ack that waste disposal is one of the biggest worry. USA also doesn't want RW in their backyard and scouting for  sites in Africa . Despite construction being started on UTAH dispoal facility  it is no where near complete. At least you can try to sink carbon , but sinking RW is  near impossible, only containment is possible. And god forbid if it fails. Though it would be unfortunate if option is foreclosed without consideration. No one wants that.That is why on Maharashtra CM announced that no Nuke plant if there are safety concerns. Villagers, unless assured, would protest and it  would be difficult to ignore. As you may be knowing that decision is not only technical, economic or energy requirement based , but also political and social and environmental. So communication is the key.  I agree with lalmohan that there are issues but option should be open.Consent of villagers should be informed one and not forced one.This issue is  very topical and of relevance to us. Therefore there would be a full review , I can guarantee as much."

I find many of his posts to be quite informative.Chaanakya - If you can make your questions precise and put them in Physics thread, I will try to respond.  By precise, I mean, which article (link), what statement(s). etc.  The science of predicting/understanding health effects of low level (less than 100 mSv)  of radiation is more statistical.. any good book will help. Check out   google  for"" Linear No Threshold Hypothesis"" the main method many use.  Just for perspective   'ANS concurs with the  following Position Statement on “Radiation Risk in Perspective” issued by the Health Physics Society.(see eg: http://www.ans.org/pi/ps/docs/ps41.pdf)“In accordance with the current knowledge of radiation health risks, the Health Physics Society recommends against quantitative estimation of health risks below an individual dose of 5 rem1  in one year or a lifetime dose of 10 rem in addition to background radiation. Risk estimation in this dose range should be strictly qualitative accentuating a  range of hypothetical health outcomes with an emphasis on the likely possibility of zero adverse health effects. The current philosophy of radiation protection is based on the assumption that any radiation dose, no matter  how small, may result in human effects, such as cancer and hereditary genetic damage. There is substantial and convincing scientific evidence for health risks at  high dose. Below 10  rem (which includes occupational and environmental exposures) risks of health effects are either too small to be observed or are non-existent.” 1 The rem is the unit of effective dose. In international units, 1 rem = 0.01 sievert (SV) (This is not to diss LNTH method but to get the right perspective when you read these reports based on LNTH)  DO you want to say that those studies are either wrong or quoted out of context by the journo?Sorry, unless I see  these studies, I can't say they are wrong..(Don't get me wrong but I really don't   want to see all those reports..honestly I lose interest in reports where  someone is claiming 1,000,000 deaths  just like when I see reports of 7,000,000,000 army troops in Kashmir /smile/) One can't really rely on so called expert studies either way since there are conflicting conclusions  One shouldn't quickly dismiss these reports  either. One TMI study, for example was ordered by US President, and had experts from all the sides.. (US has fairly big anti-nuclear lobby too), This, and every other study, has not found a single  case of radiation cancer in 20+ years which they can directly link to TMI.  There are no 'conflicting conclusions' , at least,  in the case of  the TMI study.  This issue is  very topical and of relevance to us. Therefore there would be a full review , I can guarantee as much.Agree 400%.Folks: One issue, IMO, is our instruments are  very sensitive and one can really measure very low level of radiation. Again, just to put in layman's term, if one drops a bucket  full of I-131 in  ocean at Juhu beach, I can  find   some of those atoms  in a cup I pick up out from  sea in  California.   Radioactivity  detection equipments are very sensitive. One can EASILY detect a 1986 wine because of high radioactivity absorbed by grapes in Italy (or Califonia) from Cs which spewed out in Chernobyl. (Wine made in 1950-60 era (lot of atmospheric testing) and 1986 stand out. As I have said in a previous post, actually all wines sold in US by law  have to be radioactive to be sold .)All people (unless they have been dead for years) emit easily measurable dose (about 0.4 mSv/yr)  too.  (mostly due to K40)We have all heard or did calculation  in our high-school science class - every breath you take has many (hundreds!) air molecules which came out from the dying breath of Aurangjeb.

Giant waves were heading for the Oregon coast, about an hour from Reyes’s Corvallis office.     As news poured in during the next 12 hours that the cooling system at a Tokyo Electric Power Co. nuclear plant had been damaged, Reyes’s anxiety grew. People were using the words “potential meltdown” with alarming frequency.     Reyes, 55, who founded NuScale Power Inc. in 2007 to design a slimmed-down, 45-megawatt reactor, contemplated the blot on the already beleaguered nuclear industry -- and the prospects for his nascent company, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its May issue.     “We’ve been hard-pressed but not crushed,” he says.“Stopping the progress being made would be a mistake.”     Convinced that today’s large nuclear projects are burdened by too much financial risk, NuScale is designing and testing a 60-foot-high (18-meter-high) reactor encased in a thermos-like metal sheath. It would cost about $200 million and could be used to light and heat villages, desalinate ocean water or be strung together side by side to form a midsize power plant -- virtually free of carbon emissions. With some investors on board, Reyes plans to ask the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license in late 2012.     “More and more people see small nuclear as a green technology,” he says.                        Nuclear Revival     Decades after accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl poisoned attitudes and the environment, Reyes and a cadre of scientists, engineers and investors have been betting that small-scale reactors can spark a nuclear revival.     Hyperion Power Generation Inc. in Santa Fe, New Mexico, is working on 25-megawatt, refrigerator-sized designs for $50 million each that could power remote locations or be used in hospitals and factories. By 2020, Russian nuclear company Rosatom Corp. expects to sell seven barges equipped with twin 35-megawatt reactors for the Arctic and Africa. In Argentina, the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is clearing ground in the central grasslands for a 25-megawatt prototype planned for 2014.     Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates is backing a more powerful, 500-megawatt reactor designed by TerraPower LLC in Bellevue, Washington. Its traveling-wave technology usesuranium-238 to fuel a reaction in what functions like a 13-foot- tall candle.                      ‘Valuable Offering’     “If it works, it’s hard to think of a more valuable offering in the energy space,” says Izhar Armony, a partner at Waltham, Massachusetts-based Charles River Ventures, which invested in TerraPower.      As improbable as it may sound amid the devastation in northeastern Japan, the nuclear accident may increase the appeal of innovative, small-scale reactors, says Chris Gadomski, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst in San Francisco.     “We’re seeing a knee-jerk reaction saying, ‘get rid of nuclear,’ but that’s not going to happen in the long run,” he says. “There is no other good solution if you want to decarbonize the energy sector. As far as small reactors go, these events in Japan will strengthen their hand as opposed to weakening it.”     U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1997 for using lasers to study atomic particles, has requested $97 million for small-reactor development in fiscal 2012, which begins on Oct. 1. Chu said on March 16 that President Barack Obama’s administration will press ahead with efforts to expand loan guarantees for new reactors.                        Nuclear and Coal                                     Maurice Gunderson, a partner at San Francisco-based CMEA Ventures, invested in NuScale four years ago. He predicts he’ll raise an additional $200 million by June 1, even after the Japanese disaster.     Anti-nuclear sentiments inflamed by leaking radiation at the Fukushima plant may subside over time, he says. More crucial, he says, is that the world has few good options to replace the one-seventh of its electricity that’s produced by nuclear reactors.     “Powering a society as large as the one we have means using nuclear power and coal,” he says. “Nothing else we have at the present time is big enough to do it in a sustained way.And coal means lopping off mountaintops, air pollution and mining deaths. It’s tremendously hazardous.”     Burning petroleum spews carbon into the air, and rising prices ripple through the global economy. From Dec. 17, when riots erupted in Tunisia and spread to oil-rich nations in the region, Brent crude for May settlement surged 26 percent to $115.70 a barrel in London on March 22.                    No Pumps, External Power     Reyes says his preliminary data show that his reactor would have survived the Japanese earthquake -- and held up under one that shook the ground even harder. NuScale’s reactor core is housed inside a vessel that’s 10 times stronger than the one in Japan, he says, and that’s placed in a pool of water and buried underground.     More important, his design doesn’t require pumps or external power to cool the reactor. Fukushima Dai-Ichi reactors, of which Toshiba Corp. was among the builders, overheated when power sources failed and pumps couldn’t deliver cooling water.     NuScale’s design relies on so-called passive safety systems that take advantage of natural circulation created by the heating and cooling of water inside and outside the reactor.NuScale’s design, which uses about 5 percent of the amount of fuel of the big models, produces less heat after it’s idled.      “Keep your core covered with liquid -- that’s the rule of thumb,” Reyes says.                        Last Bit of Hope                                     The accident in Japan is hurting Toshiba. The company’s shares have dropped 17 percent in the days after the earthquake and tsunami to 406 yen on March 22. On March 16, China suspended approval of new nuclear projects and said it would conduct safety inspections of all plants under construction. China has chosen the AP1000 from Toshiba’s Westinghouse unit as its flagship, with the first one set to go online in 2013.     Mycle Schneider, a Paris-based nuclear industry analyst who has advised the governments of Belgium, France and Germany on atomic energy, says small reactors would have been vulnerable to the twin forces of Japan’s earthquake and tsunami.     “The industry has lost the last remaining bit of hope,”he says. Nuclear proponents can’t recover by painting rosy views of a carbon-free atomic future, Schneider says. “This was a big one for the nuclear industry,” he says.                    Consuming Nuclear Waste     New reactor models will arrive too slowly to make a dent in global warming, while used fuel stored in pools of water is a prime terrorist target and safety risk, he says. Permanent waste disposal solutions mean digging into granite or salt and leaving radioactive material for thousands of years.     In the face of such dire predictions, nuclear power has been growing as countries strive to slake mankind’s appetite for energy.     The world has 441 reactors, including those at Japan’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi facility, with a total of 375,000 megawatts of capacity, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency said in September 2010. That provided about 14 percent of the world’s power last year. Another 60 reactors are in the works, and output may reach 445,000 megawatts by 2020, the IAEA says.     By 2025, the world could add 36 small reactors, each with 400 megawatts of capacity or less, according to the IAEA. Of the38 reactors of this size operating today, 34 were built before 1990 and use traditional technology rather than new designs.                           TerraPower     TerraPower, the company Gates is backing, aims to build a sodium-cooled reactor by 2020. It would consume spent fuel from conventional plants and generate less waste of its own, addressing a problem that has dogged the industry. TerraPower has spent tens of millions of dollars on research and will need several billion dollars more for a prototype, CEO John Gilleland says.     Toshiba is planning a 10-megawatt model that, if approved, may supply the Alaskan village of Galena. Older, larger Toshiba reactors overheated amid the earthquake when backup systems failed to keep them cool. Toshiba declined to comment on the impact of the accident on its small-scale program.     Babcock & Wilcox Co., Reyes’s main competitor in small models, has lined up a customer -- a crucial step before seeking NRC approval for its technology. The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally owned utility in seven states, may build six small Babcock reactors to provide power for 4,800 Department of Energy researchers in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, says Andrea Sterdis, TVA senior manager for nuclear expansion. Terry Johnson, a TVA spokesman, says it’s too soon to say how the Japanese accident may affect small-scale reactor development.                        Babcock and TMI     Babcock, which supplied boilers for New York’s first subways, also built the reactor for the stricken Three Mile Island nuclear facility near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In 1979, a commission appointed by U.S. President Jimmy Carter criticized the company for, among other things, failing to notify customers that the kind of coolant valve that caused the Pennsylvania accident had already failed nine other times. Babcock declared bankruptcy in 2000 as a result of legal claims for exposure to asbestos in its power-generating equipment. The company emerged from bankruptcy six years later.     Babcock’s new, 125-megawatt reactors would cost about $500 million each and become available as early as 2018, says Christofer Mowry, CEO of Babcock’s B&W Modular Nuclear Energy unit. He declined, through a spokesman, to comment on the Fukushima accident.                      ‘Icing on the Cake’                                     Ben Landy, an analyst at Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Group Inc., says that Babcock already builds reactors for the U.S. Navy and that the company’s boilers and pollution-control equipment for coal plants are competitive strengths.     “If small reactors become a big market, that’s icing on the cake,” Landy says.     With 14.4 million shares, T. Rowe Price is Babcock’s biggest investor. Babcock shares rose 52 percent from Aug. 2, when the company was spun off from McDermott International Inc., to $35.09 on March 10, the day before the earthquake. The stock has dropped 9.8 percent since then, to $31.65 on March 22.     Landy says negative publicity over Fukushima may impede large U.S. reactors already fighting to raise money. Buyers may view Babcock’s small models as safer, partly because they’re buried in the ground, he says.                                                          NRC Gears Up                                     The NRC has been marshalling resources for when applications for mini-reactors start rolling in, NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko says. The commission has 50 people who will determine whether the models need the same personnel, security and insurance as big designs and whether operators should pay similar licensing, disposal and decommissioning fees.     The NRC is familiar with NuScale’s basic design and is likely to certify it, BNEF’s Gadomski predicts. Hyperion’s 8- foot-tall models present a tougher security challenge because they’re intended for remote locations. Common thieves probably couldn’t steal them, but a rogue government could -- and then may convert the uranium into weapons, he says.     Even as Republicans in Congress attacked Obama’s energy plan, they left most nuclear programs intact. After Japan’s woes, Democrats may be less likely to support the administration’s nuclear agenda.     The day after the earthquake, Representative Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, called for a moratorium on new plants in seismically active areas until additional safety reviews could be completed. Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who heads the Senate’s Homeland Security Committee, sought a pause until the Japan accident could be analyzed.                        Evaluating Risk     The U.S. nuclear industry is already growing more slowly than those of China, Russia and India. Nuclear generating capacity may jump by 77 percent in the Far East, including China, by 2020 compared with 12 percent in North America, the IAEA says. Capacity in Western Europe may drop 24 percent in that period, the agency says.     Most U.S. utilities still see too much risk. Constellation Energy Group Inc. abandoned a five-year quest in October for a third big reactor in Lusby, Maryland. Chicago-based Exelon Corp., the largest U.S. nuclear operator, with 17 reactors, is reassessing a $3.65 billion plan to raise output at its nuclear plants because the company expects safety reviews by the NRC, CEO John Rowe said on March 16. Marilyn Kray, vice president of nuclear development, says if utilities need power, and can be convinced that small reactors are cost-effective, they may build them at existing nuclear or coal sites, which already have transmission lines and permits.                          1,000 Alarms     That thinking meshes with Reyes’s plans for NuScale.     Seated in his office near Oregon State University, where two paintings by Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser lean, unhung, against the wall, Reyes recalls how living through the worst U.S. nuclear accident taught him about scale.     He was working as a safety analyst at the NRC during the partial core meltdown at General Public Utilities Corp.’s Three Mile Island plant in 1979. He studied how operators of the Babcock reactor were baffled by 1,000 alarms going off simultaneously. Today, a plant’s key diagnostics fit on one computer screen, he says.     “Simplicity matters,” Reyes says.     Reyes began forming his idea for NuScale after he got a DOE grant to develop reactors for emerging markets. He built a mock power plant that resembles a 12-foot-tall chimney to troubleshoot his designs in a four-story garage at Oregon State, where he’s on leave from his job as a tenured professor. He decided to commercialize the technology and filed 18 patent applications.                       ‘Right Way to Go’     Reyes, who holds a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering from the University of Maryland, used similar equipment to convince the NRC in 2005 that a $6 billion, 1,117-megawatt behemoth designed by Toshiba’s Westinghouse unit was safe partly because, like NuScale’s, it relies on passive safety systems. China later adopted Toshiba’s design for its future reactors.     “After reviewing all these events in Japan, people may decide that these passive plants might be the right way to go,”Reyes says.     Reyes had been struggling to raise money even before the Japanese crisis. His woes worsened in January, when the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against his biggest backer, Francisco Illarramendi, claiming that Illarramendi transferred money among investment accounts without telling clients.                                                         Worth Billions     Illarramendi, principal owner of Michael Kenwood Group LLC in Stamford, Connecticut, pleaded guilty in March to what the SEC described as a multiyear Ponzi scheme. He could face up to 70 years in prison, prosecutors say. John Gleason, his attorney, declined to comment.     In January, when the lawsuit temporarily froze NuScale’s bank account, CEO Paul Lorenzini fired 30 of 100 employees and hundreds of contractors and cut pay by as much as 50 percent.     One potential investor, Ray Rothrock, who works in Palo Alto, California, for venture firm Venrock Associates, says he passed on NuScale because no one can predict whether or when the NRC will approve its design. The Fukushima accident magnifies the uncertainty, he says.     “This will slow things down, cost money and require the regulatory people to opine on it,” Rothrock says. If NuScale passes its regulatory hurdles, he says, the company will be worth billions of dollars.                       Nuclear Batteries     About 1,450 miles (2,333 kilometers) from Reyes’s Oregon lab, in Santa Fe, Hyperion CEO John Deal has been working on what he calls “nuclear batteries” that hospitals, remote communities and oil companies can use for power and heat. Each reactor is designed to run for eight years before Deal retrieves it and drops off a new one.     Deal, 47, worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he says he got the idea to commercialize small nuclear technology, as “resident entrepreneur.” By 2020, Hyperion aims to have a prototype that can operate at 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit(538 degrees Celsius), 400 degrees hotter than water-cooled designs. Hyperion’s lead-bismuth model and sodium-cooled versions from other companies could generate electricity as well as heat for refining bitumen into crude oil or for warming the maternity ward of a hospital.     Deal says his “batteries” offer advantages over the reactors in Japan. They’d spread out power generation rather than concentrating it; they’d be a fraction the size of traditional models; and they’d be buried inside reinforced bunkers designed to withstand earthquakes. Cooling would work by gravity, without pumps.                     ‘Get Out of Berkeley’     “If there is a worst, worst, worst case, all contamination, if any, should be very local and remain in the ground inside the vault,” Deal says.     People are likely to accept such security, especially if lack of power means they don’t have basic necessities such as clean water, Deal says.     “You have to get out of Berkeley to realize how badly people need electricity,” he says, referring to the California college town that has long been a protest hotbed. If the NRC moves too slowly to license his reactor, Deal says, he’ll build it overseas.     The planet has 40 years to slice carbon emissions in half or suffer a deadly rise in temperatures, according to the International Energy Agency, which advises the governments of 28 countries, including the U.S.     Nuclear proponents say meeting this challenge requires a cascade of inventions, including reactors that are smaller, safer and cheaper -- even after the crisis in Japan.     “There is still a need for clean energy and for getting away from fossil fuels,” Reyes says. “That part of the equation doesn’t change.”"

If not, can you point which part of science tells us that?The conventional wisdom of LWRs being somehow proliferation resistant went out of the window many years, in fact decades back...The entire premise was that if you set up LWRs without enrichment facilities then it would be easier for IAEA and assorted entities to figure out in case fuel (or waste) was being diverted for reprocessing..the favoured model in fact was ""All in, All out"" (remains so now)...Problem is, no one, crtainly not the ""problem"" states wants an ""all in all out"" solution...Infact there is almost never an ""all out"" solution....Plus, reprocessing facilities have become smaller, more efficient and easier to hide..Classic case? Iran...It has quite plausibly claimed that all its reprocessing was part of its LWR programme! The old proposal of the South koreans giving 2 LWRs to NoKo in return for a shutting down of the nuke programme at least partialy got nixed because of proliferation concerns (raised by NPAs, who else?) on the LWRs...The CANDU design is a heavily marketed affair (by the Canadians) - dont see that as a show stopper for any Indian plans to market it as well!Anyways, I guess the discussion is going OT..."

This issue is  very topical and of relevance to us. Therefore there would be a full review , I can guarantee as much.Agree 400%.Amber, links are there in previous posts. The journo , Mr Ritt has quoted from Scientific study. Unless I read that in whole can't much comment on that but he certainly doesn't claim 1,000,000 deaths etc.  I am not dismissive of reports, frankly , I lose interest when  the absolutist position is taken "" I am right  and others are wrong"" type.  Truth may lie somewhere in between. What is told as scientific facts are sometimes hypothesis forced upon gullible masses on someone's authority ,who may be the conflicted party.I will take the liberty to requote few sentences produced by Mr Ritt.According to a 2006 Swedish study published in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine, it appears Sweden experienced approximately a thousand excess cancer fatalities because of Chernobyl, the number expected to increase, the cases concentrated proportional to the levels of radioactive exposure. As might be imagined, there were other health effects as well, such as effects with an impact on unborn children.A 2007 study performed by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a prestigious Cambridge Massachusetts-based think-tank, examined the cognitive effects of Chernobyl's radiation on Swedish children. It found evidence that ""fetal exposure to ionizing radiation damages cognitive ability at radiation levels previously considered safe"".I am reading all your posts and, frankly, I find them informative, and somewhat feel better when I eat banana or spinach.Due to  cognitive dissonance one may tend to  overlook the sentencesAs you may be knowing that decision is not only technical, economic or energy requirement based , but also political and social and environmental. So communication is the keyAfterall the study concludes  It found evidence that ""fetal exposure to ionizing radiation damages cognitive ability at radiation levels previously considered safe"". How can I blame the nuclear experts. One can always take shelter in this report if found wrong at a later date , esp nuk experts . And That is why people tend  to compare different things together, like if you accept vaccination you should also accept radiation risk because  in both people die. The question of acceptable risk is relevant. Amber has pointed out two different but competing hypotheses. and he also agrees that This is not to diss LNTH method Right perspective is important.People take radiation through x-ray or CT pr PET. or even vaccination or train /plane travel. Safety precautions are there and people know and accept the risk.Whereas when you draw 30 km radius circle, did you ask people to accept the risk beforehand. People  matters as they are the affected party.  Jaitapur is the same question.  And technology is not politics neutral. One doesn't prevent scientists do the work in labs. I  am not sure if I said PHWR is safe or better vs. LWR. or if 3-stage cycle is safe. Putting words where it is not there is inappropriate at least in this context.  That is entirely a different discussion. Safer alternatives ( if one points to this ) mean different things. In fact Japan has such coal tech which meet stringent environment standards and produce power at 40 % efficiency and 100% PLF. Only Unkil is somewhat nearer  at 35% efficiency. We have 18-20%.No Ultra super critical tech as yet.But, then it is not the point to discuss here else people would complain of ambient noise as in ambient background radiation, which interfere with correct reading of radiation level, which incidentally reduces as a square of the distance from the source.IAEA's entire existence is premised upon existence of Nuclear industry and manned by people who have stake in it continuance. While not dissing their reports I would tend to be circumspect. Has anyone wondered why there is no ICEA (International Coal Energy Agency) to manage  and control those technology?Tsunami and quake has opened  the  debate. But we have bigger lessons to learn from these disasters. How Japanese have managed the disaster for which they prepared  very long and hard and how they are coping with post tsunami rehabilitation.It would also give lessons for tech improvements in nuk industry.  In this nuk brouhaha that is being lost."

I hope you and others do  read it carefully. (Gentle readers, I am  trying to be brief, so please read the original link given by Chaaankya to get the Context etc)1) - About the figures 100,000  deaths (it also quotes other reports which gives figures 985,000 ) It also reports “a thousand excess cancer fatalities because of Chernobyl”   and it quotes “The IAEA has stated that only ""up to four thousand"" fatal cancers will result from Chernobyl. .”Now one does not need privy to Roy and Nigam text book, or secret sources.. I just did a google on “death toll Chernobyl” and right  at the top, was this link:http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article563041.eceIt is a Times article with sources..  and it points out all the reports (including that  Greenpeace had  condemned the IAEA report) but at least let us see what the report is (to see  how accurately Ritt is reporting these reports)You will notice, (If you really read the article)… (All figures are according to the report.. I obviously don;’ vouch for that)-	“up to 4,000 fatal cancers”  estimate was made at the time of accident.. final figure  is  57 total deaths.

Specially when one is discussing “fetal exposure to ionizing radiation damages cognitive ability at radiation levels previously considered safe … in  sweeden”  this  sounds like a quote from ScFi movie:“ Due to radiation, our dog  even though 24,00 Km away from point zero,  had so many puppies that  vet could not count them as he ran out of fingures”(Seriously, why can’t one (specially if it is a “prestigious” this and that) get the right radiation meter (or more likely put it on the right scale) to actually measure the dose!!!)3. I was also surprised that the article also gives the same NYT report about tainted milk.  I and others have posted it and put the numbers in perspectrive.  Sankuji have posted it multiple times in multiple threads after that. And now it is being refered again in the Mitt article. Just read the article it self (where it says  drinking it for a year will be equivalent ot 1 CT scan etc,,()Okay ..Ld50 dose is 100 times worse (from 150000 tons to 1500 tons).. that’s why Japan is taking precautions… but 100,000 deaths??? (because experts don't understand and lie)  … Really???  Doubting those numbers (100,000 or 985,000 deaths)  a “hypothesis forced upon gullible masses..??????"

Concrete buildings can withstand tsunami up to 4 meters or so, but would also be destroyed if it exceeds 16 meters."

Mitsuhiko Tanaka says he helped conceal a manufacturing defect in the ¥20 billion steel vessel installed at the reactor while working for a unit of Hitachi in 1974. The reactor, which Tanaka has called a ""time bomb,"" was shut for maintenance when the March 11 earthquake triggered a tsunami that disabled cooling systems at the plant, leading to explosions and radiation leaks.""Who knows what would have happened if that reactor had been running?"" Tanaka, who turned his back on the nuclear industry after the Chernobyl disaster, said in an interview last week. ""I have no idea if it could withstand an earthquake like this. It's got a faulty reactor inside.""Tanaka's allegations, which he says he brought to the attention of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in 1988, when it was the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and chronicled in a book two years later called ""Why Nuclear Power is Dangerous,"" have resurfaced after the nation's worst nuclear accident on record. The No. 4 reactor was hit by explosions and a fire that spread from adjacent units as the crisis deepened.Hitachi spokesman Yuichi Izumisawa said the company met with Tanaka in 1988 to discuss the work he did to fix a dent in the vessel and concluded there was no safety problem. ""We have not revised our view since then,"" Izumisawa said.Kenta Takahashi, an official at METI's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said he couldn't confirm whether the agency's predecessor, the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, had conducted an investigation into Tanaka's claims. Naoki Tsunoda, a spokesman at Tokyo Electric Power Co., said he couldn't immediately comment.Tanaka says the reactor pressure vessel inside the No. 4 reactor was damaged at a Babcock-Hitachi foundry in Kure, Hiroshima Prefecture, during the last step of a manufacturing process that took 2 1/2 years and cost billions of yen. If the mistake had been discovered, the company might have been bankrupted, he said.Inside a blast furnace the size of a small airplane hanger, the reactor pressure vessel was being treated one last time to remove welding stress. The cylinder, 20 meters tall and 5.8 meters in diameter, was heated to more than 600 degrees, a temperature that softens metal.Braces that were to have been placed inside during the blasting were either forgotten or fell over when the cylinder was wheeled into the furnace. After the vessel cooled, its walls were warped, Tanaka said."

They then will publicize the cars' registration numbers and vehicle identification numbers for a certain period of time.If the owners claim the cars, the vehicles would be handed over so they can scrap them. If they do not appear before the as-yet-unspecified deadline, the local governments will scrap the cars.The Miyagi prefectural government has sought permission from the central government to shoulder the duties of municipal governments located in the Sanriku coastal region, as many local governments there have ceased to function.However, the plan to secure sites for wrecked cars would impose an additional burden on municipalities in Fukushima, Iwate and Miyagi prefectures, as they are already having difficulty finding places to keep the bodies of victims and provide temporary accommodation for those who have lost their homes.The central government also will exempt electrical appliances left behind in the disaster-stricken areas from the Home Appliance Recycling Law, which obliges owners to recycle the appliances, according to the sources.This will enable municipal governments to scrap those appliances as disaster waste.On Monday, the government set up in the Cabinet Office building an office for the headquarters tasked with supporting survivors of the earthquake and tsunami.Tatsuo Hirano, senior vice minister of the Cabinet Office who has been appointed head of the new office, said the headquarters will prepare guidelines on how to remove and dispose of rubble.

Astonishingly ( being a nuk noobie) it says The U.S. has 104 operating nuclear reactors, situated on 65 sites in 31 states. There are another 15 permanently shut reactors that also house spent fuel.I didn't want to snip. If  quoting in whole is found inappropriate , mods please delete it, leaving the link .The nuclear crisis in Japan has laid bare an ever-growing problem for the United States -- the enormous amounts of still-hot radioactive waste accumulating at commercial nuclear reactors in more than 30 states.The U.S. has 71,862 tons of the waste, according to state-by-state numbers obtained by The Associated Press. But the nation has no place to permanently store the material, which stays dangerous for tens of thousands of years.Plans to store nuclear waste at Nevada's Yucca Mountain have been abandoned, but even if a facility had been built there, America already has more waste than it could have handled.Three-quarters of the waste sits in water-filled cooling pools like those at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear complex in Japan, outside the thick concrete-and-steel barriers meant to guard against a radioactive release from a nuclear reactor.Spent fuel at Dai-ichi overheated, possibly melting fuel-rod casings and spewing radiation into the air, after Japan's tsunami knocked out power to cooling systems at the plant.The rest of the spent fuel from commercial U.S. reactors has been put into dry cask storage, but regulators only envision those as a solution for about a century and the waste would eventually have to be deposited into a Yucca-like facility.This April 14, 1998 file photo shows the defunct Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset, Maine. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File)The U.S. nuclear industry says the waste is being stored safely at power-plant sites, though it has long pushed for a long-term storage facility. Meanwhile, the industry's collective pile of waste is growing by about 2,200 tons a year; experts say some of the pools in the United States contain four times the amount of spent fuel that they were designed to handle.The AP analyzed a state-by-state summary of spent fuel data based on information that nuclear power plants voluntarily report every year to the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry and lobbying group. The NEI would not make available the amount of spent fuel at individual power plants.While the U.S. Department of Energy previously reported figures on overall spent fuel storage, it no longer has updated information available. A spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees nuclear power plant safety, said the capacities of fuel pools are public record, but exact inventories of spent fuel are tracked in a government database kept confidential for security reasons.The U.S. has 104 operating nuclear reactors, situated on 65 sites in 31 states. There are another 15 permanently shut reactors that also house spent fuel.Four states have spent fuel even though they don't have operating commercial plants. Reactors in Colorado, Oregon and Maine are permanently shut; spent fuel from all three is stored in dry casks. Idaho never had a commercial reactor, but waste from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania is being stored at a federal facility there.Illinois has 9,301 tons of spent nuclear fuel at its power plants, the most of any state in the country, according to industry figures. It is followed by Pennsylvania with 6,446 tons; 4,290 in South Carolina and roughly 3,780 tons each for New York and North Carolina.Spent nuclear fuel is about 95 percent uranium. About 1 percent are other heavy elements such as curium, americium and plutonium-239, best known as fuel for nuclear weapons. Each has an extremely long half-life -- some take hundreds of thousands of years to lose all of their radioactive potency. The rest, about 4 percent, is a cocktail of byproducts of fission that break down over much shorter time periods, such as cesium-137 and strontium-90, which break down completely in about 300 years.How dangerous these elements are depends on how easily can find their way into the body. Plutonium and uranium are heavy, and don't spread through the air well, but there is a concern that plutonium could leach into water supplies over thousands of years.Cesium-137 is easily transported by air. It is cesium-137 that can still be detected in a New Jersey-sized patch of land around the Chernobyl reactor that exploded in the Ukraine in 1986.Typically, waste must sit in pools at least five years before being moved to a cask or permanent storage, but much of the material in the pools of U.S. plants has been stored there far longer than that.Safety advocates have long urged the NRC to force utility operators to reduce the amount of spent fuel in their pools. The more tightly packed they are, the more quickly they can overheat and spew radiation into the environment in case of an accident, a natural disaster or a terrorist attack.Industry leaders say new technology has made fuel pools safer, and regulators have taken some steps since the 9/11 terror attacks to reduce fuel pool risks. Kevin Crowley, who directs the nuclear and radiation studies board at the National Academy of Sciences, says lessons will be learned from the crisis in Japan. And NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko says his agency will review how spent fuel is stored in the U.S.A 2004 report by the academy suggested that fresh spent fuel, which is radioactively hotter, be spread among older, cooler assemblies in the spent fuel pool. ""You're buying yourself time, basically,"" says Crowley. ""The cooler ones can act as a thermal buffer.""First Energy, which runs two nuclear power stations in Ohio and one in Pennsylvania, was able to reconfigure the spent fuel rods in its pools to make more room. Still, the company is now running out of space, says spokesman Todd Schneider. Ohio has 1,136 tons of spent fuel in pools and 37 tons in dry casks.The casks in the U.S. are kept outdoors, generally on concrete pads, but industry officials insist they are safe. Unlike the pools, the casks don't need electricity; they are cooled by air circulation.One cask model, selling for $1.5 million, places spent fuel inside a stainless steel canister, which is placed inside an ""overpack"" -- an outside shell composed of a layer of carbon steel, 68.58 centimeters of concrete and another layer of carbon steel. When in place, the system stands 6 meters and weighs 68,040 kilograms, said Joy Russell, a spokeswoman for manufacturer Holtec International of Florida.Russell said engineers have designed the system to withstand a crash from an F-16 fighter jet and survive the resulting jet fuel fire.Plant operators in some states have moved aggressively to dry cask storage. Virginia has 1,533 tons of nuclear waste in dry storage and 1,105 tons in spent fuel pools. Maryland has 844 tons in dry storage and 588 tons in spent fuel pools.Utilities in Texas, though, have not. There are 2,178 tons kept in spent fuel pools at reactor sites there, and zero in dry casks. In New York, 3,345 tons are in spent fuel pools while only 454 tons are in dry storage.No cask is totally invulnerable, but the academy report found that radioactive releases from casks would be relatively low.""If you attacked a fuel cask and managed to put a hole in it, anything that came out, the consequences would be very local,"" Crowley said.Casks can be licensed for 20 years, with renewals, said Carrie Phillips, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based Southern Co., which has a dozen such casks at its two-reactor Joseph M. Farley plant in Alabama. She said officials have ""every expectation"" the casks could last ""in excess of 100 years by design.""But not the needed tens of thousands of years. For long-term storage, the government had looked to Yucca Mountain. It was designed to hold 77,160 tons -- 69,444 tons designated for commercial waste and 7,716 for military waste. That means the current inventory already exceeds Yucca's original planned capacity.A 1982 law gave the federal government responsibility for the long-term storage of nuclear waste and promised to start accepting waste in 1998. After 20 years of study, Congress passed a law in 2002 to build a nuclear waste repository deep in Yucca Mountain.The federal government spent $9 billion developing the project, but the Obama administration has cut funding and recalled the license application to build it. Nevadans have fiercely opposed Yucca Mountain, though a collection of state governments and others are taking legal action to reverse the decision.Despite his Yucca Mountain decision, President Barack Obama wants to expand nuclear power. He created a commission last year to come up with a long-term nuclear waste plan. Initial findings are expected this summer, with a final plan expected in January.""They are 13 years late,"" says Terry Pickens, Director of Nuclear Policy at Xcel Energy, the Minneapolis-based utility that operates three reactors in Minnesota. Xcel is building steel-and-concrete cask containers to hold old waste on site, and suing the government periodically to pay for them. ""We would like them to get done with what they said they would get done.""Some countries -- such as France, Japan, Russia and the United Kingdom -- reprocess their spent fuel into new nuclear fuel to help reduce the amount of waste.The remaining waste is solidified into a glass. It needs to be stored in a long-term waste repository, but reprocessing reduces the volume of waste by three-quarters.Because reprocessing isolates plutonium, which can be used to make a nuclear weapon, Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter put a stop to it in the U.S. The ban was later overturned, but the country still does not reprocess.France produces 1,300 tons of nuclear waste per year, and reprocesses 940 tons. Still, fuel is only reprocessed once and then it, too, needs to be stored. France is expecting that engineers will eventually succeed in building a new type of nuclear reactor called a fast reactor that will use the waste it can't reprocess as fuel.""They've kicked the can down the road,"" says Frank von Hippel, a director of the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University.Other countries, such as Germany, store spent fuel in casks. Finland is building a repository it says will store waste safely for 100,000 years.Even though there is no long-term storage in the U.S., utility customers and taxpayers have been paying for it -- twice.Customers have paid $24 billion into a fund Congress established in 1982 to pay for such storage. The charge -- a penny for every 10 kilowatt-hours -- would typically add up to about $11 a year for a household that received all its electricity from nuclear plants.Users pay as taxpayers, too -- for dry storage. Utilities that have run out of storage space in pools successfully sued the federal government for breach of contract, because it failed to keep to the 1998 deadline to establish long-term storage. By law, the money for dry casks cannot come from the nuclear waste fund, and must come from the federal budget."

Tepco said the neutron beam measured about 1.5 km southwest of the plant's Nos. 1 and 2 reactors over three days from March 13 and is equivalent to 0.01 to 0.02 microsieverts per hour. This is not a dangerous level of radiation, it added.The utility said it will also measure uranium and plutonium, which could emit a neutron beam.In the 1999 criticality accident at a nuclear fuel processing plant run by JCO Co. in Tokai, Ibaraki Prefecture, uranium broke apart continually in nuclear fission, causing a massive amount of neutron beams.In the latest case at the Fukushima No. 1 plant, a criticality accident has yet to happen.But the measured neutron beam may be evidence that uranium and plutonium leaked from the plant's nuclear reactors and spent nuclear fuel have discharged a small amount of neutron beams via fission."

Caesium is water soluble and has a tendency to get into ground water. It is not naturally present in the body. When it gets into the body it displaces normal Potassium increasing the radiation exposure. Because Potassium is used by so much life it tends to get concentrated up the food chain.

507,ramana,24 Mar 2011 03:46 ,"Hindu reports:What the hell is going on?Japanese PM.Nearly 4,000 spent fuel assemblies were stored at the Fukushima Daiichi unit — more than thrice the amount of fuel in the six cores Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan had every reason to ask the executives of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), “What the hell is going on?” His outburst was in response to the delay of nearly an hour by TEPCO officials to alert him about the third explosion at the Fukushima nuclear facility. Can it be dismissed as a slip on the part of TEPCO officials, given the emergency situation at the nuclear facility? Quite unlikely. This is not an isolated case, and TEPCO has a dubious track record of falsification and concealing crucial data, including safety data, of the nuclear plants. Ticking time bombIt has now come to light that the company has been storing 4,000 spent uranium fuel assemblies at its nuclear units at Fukushima Daiichi. This is equivalent to almost the amount of highly radioactive uranium fuel produced in six years by the units and more than three times the amount of radioactive material present in the cores of all the six units.For instance, Unit-4 had some 548 still-hot fuel assemblies stored in a pool of water in the upper floor. It was the lack of cooling water in this pool that ultimately led to an explosion of the roof of Unit-4.More than 60 per cent of the spent fuel from the facility is stored in a separate pool built in 1997. According to Reuters, constrained by space, TEPCO had initiated steps to increase the storage capacity of spent fuel inside the reactor buildings by “re-racking” the pools. There were other plans for increasing the storage capacity outside the reactor buildings. But only the reactor buildings offered sufficient open space for any significant increase in storage capacity. “TEPCO had the capacity to more than double the number of fuel assemblies stored in the reactors from 3,998 at the time of the quake to 8,310 assemblies,” according to Reuters.No safety checksThe Guardian reports that TEPCO had missed safety checks over a 10-year period up to two weeks before the March 11 quake. For instance, the company had failed to carry out safety checks on 33 pieces of equipment inside the plant's cooling system. The company's admission of this omission came weeks after government regulators approved prolonging of the life of one of the six reactors.   This is not the first time that TEPCO had violated safety norms, concealed crucial safety data, or even vital information about geological fault structures.Turning a blind eyeIt was after the 2007 earthquake of 6.8 magnitude, which hit the seven reactors at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Japan's west coast that it became clear that the reactor facility was built directly on top of a seismically active fault line. People were told about this only after the quake.According to Nature, scientists knew about the presence of an active fault under the nuclear facility but it was “ignored when the plant was enlarged.” TEPCO had apparently found a seven-km long fault line during the course of its investigation prior to expanding the facility. “But [TEPCO] failed to investigate it fully,” notes Nature. Hiroaki Nakata, a seismologist at the Hiroshima Institute of Tehnology was quoted as saying in Nature: “There's no reason for TEPCO to have stopped when they [found the fault line]. There are many places where they missed — or intentionally avoided — seeing fault lines.”The damage to the plant was minor and no one died and the amount of radiation released was reportedly negligible. Yet, this and many other instances dented the public's faith and trust. According to Nature, it became clear that 1,200 litres of contaminated water released from the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa facility into the ocean was 50 per cent more radioactive than what TEPCO had previously stated. Other instancesThere have been many instances when TEPCO had behaved irresponsibly. In February 2007, the company admitted to 199 cases of falsifying inspection data at three nuclear power plants, including Kashiwazaki-Kariwa. TEPCO was found to be slow in reporting two radiation leaks and miscalculating the amount of radiation released. In 2002, a major scandal hit the company. A government investigation revealed that TEPCO had systematically concealed safety breaches for a period stretching to nearly two decades. A three-year investigation revealed that up to 13 of the protective shells surrounding reactors had cracks. And the company officials knew about this. TEPCO ordered closure of all its reactors after it admitted to falsifying data in about 30 safety logs and up to 200 incidents. This included the now infamous Fukushima Daiichi Unit-1. Wow! They had a history of ignoring problems and not reporting the data."

Apart from this increase, there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure two decades after the accident. There is no scientific evidence of increases in overall cancer incidence or mortality rates or in rates of non-malignant disorders that could be related to radiation exposure. The incidence of leukaemia in the general population, one of the main concerns owing to the shorter time expected between exposure and its occurrence compared with solid cancers, does not appear to be elevated. Although those most highly exposed individuals are at an increased risk of radiation-associated effects, the great majority of the population is not likely to experience serious health consequences as a result of radiation from the Chernobyl accident.**ConclusionsThe accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986 was a tragic event for its victims, and those most affected suffered major hardship. Some of the people who dealt with the emergency lost their lives. Although those exposed as children and the emergency and recovery workers are at increased risk of radiation-induced effects, the vast majority of the population need not live in fear of serious health consequences due to the radiation from the Chernobyl accident. For the most part, they were exposed to radiation levels comparable to or a few times higher than annual levels of natural background, and future exposures continue to slowly diminish as the radionuclides decay. Lives have been seriously disrupted by the Chernobyl accident, but from the radiological point of view, generally positive prospects for the future health of most individuals should prevail.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

These lodge in our lungs, killing 13,200 Americans annually and sickening thousands of others.

That means that there are 100 pieces of which only 20 are needed to complete the puzzle and cause the cancer. Different combinations of the 20 may work to cause cancer.Radiation is only one of those 100 pieces. Nobody knows exactly why radiation may cause cancer. Nobody knows exactly why radiation fails to cause cancer in others. After a point medical science is shooting in the dark. They have found about 15 of the 100 pieces of jigsaw and have no clue about what is going on exactly.As a boy I agonized over cancer because my mother underwent radiation for a non cancerous condition (It was fashionable in those days to use radiation for all sorts of rubbish). I worried for many years that my mother would die of leukaemia. She died of ripe old age. On the other hand - another person, close to me, underwent the same radiation treatment in his 30s and died 30 years later with an unusual manifestation of a cancer that happened to occur in the path of the radiation that was used. No one can be sure that it was the radiation that did it. He had been a a smoker for 40 years, but I and that man's descendants will die with the suspicion that it was the radiation that did it.The rakshasa who causes cancer uses bullets of many calibers - ranging from 2.2 to 5.56 to 7.62 to 9 mm to 12.7, 23, 27, 30mm etc. Radiation is one of them. Nobody can predict whether a cancer will occur from just the single 30 mm or whether you need to take several hits from 2.2 or some other combination.

Potassium is so fundamental to life that all living organisms aeons ago that were dying early due to K40 died out selectively leaving those life forms that by chance developed mechanisms to survive despite the radiation of  Pot 40. All current theories of selection and survival work this way and the best argument against this science is creationism. However those surviving living organisms can be selectively damaged by the ingestion of radioactive Isotopes that are not naturally occurring in the environment and sequestered in the body. The exact level of risk is not clearly known or predictable in the current state of knowledge. Those of us who are in science are doing more bullshitting than we give ourselves credit for. We don't know why girls seem to be growing tits early and suspect it may be plastics. We say hormonal imbalances may cause cancer. We don't know if our plastic eating, tit growing daughters and grand daughters  will get more cancers as a result. We guess and reassure people. In our current state of knowledge we think that the body cannot differentiate isotopes. If research later shows that this is possible then it will only show what we have seen time and again - that ""current state of knowledge"" is still far from complete. We do not yet understand the sub atomic level interactions that accept or reject certain atoms and molecules."

572,chaanakya,24 Mar 2011 12:39 ,"http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201103230214.htmlThe government has advised people not to eat spinach, broccoli and some other vegetables grown in Fukushima Prefecture after radioactive substances at higher than acceptable levels were detected in samples.Although the official government view is that consumption of the contaminated vegetables will not lead to immediate health problems, health experts, even within the government, are showing more concern.Officials attributed the high radiation levels of those vegetables and milk samples to the leak of radioactive substances at the quake-stricken Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture.Prime Minister Naoto Kan on Wednesday instructed Fukushima Governor Yuhei Sato to tell prefectural residents not to consume those vegetables, including komatsuna green leaf, cabbage and cauliflower, for the time being.Kan also told Fukushima Prefecture to instruct farmers not to ship turnips, as well as the produce whose intake is restricted.Ibaraki Prefecture was told to refrain from shipping parsley and milk.The shipment restrictions came on top of those on spinach and kakina leaf grown in Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi and Gunma prefectures and milk in Fukushima Prefecture.Officials said farm cooperatives had already stopped shipping vegetables grown in open fields in Fukushima Prefecture.""The vegetables will cause no immediate health problems even if temporarily eaten now,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told a news conference Wednesday.""But regrettably, this situation is expected to continue for a long time,"" he said. ""So it is desirable, as a precautionary measure, for producers to refrain from shipping them from an early stage and for consumers to eat as little of them as possible.""Edano stressed that eating the vegetables with the highest radiation levels for 10 days will bring the total to only about half of natural radiation exposure for an entire year.""It will not lead to a radiation amount that will affect the health in the future, not just immediate problems,"" he said.But a health ministry official said the same day that the intake restriction was taken because ""continuing to eat (the vegetables) could lead to radiation exceeding the permissible yearly level for ordinary citizens.""According to the results of a health ministry survey released early Wednesday, the highest radiation level was detected in a sample of kukitachina green leaf of Motomiya, Fukushima Prefecture, about 60 kilometers from the plant. It showed 82,000 becquerels per kilogram of radioactive cesium, or 164 times the permissible level.The ministry reported that higher-than-acceptable cesium levels were found in 25 samples from Fukushima Prefecture, including spinach in Tamura, at 80 times the safety limit, shinobu-fuyuna leaf from Kawamata, at 56 times, santosai leaf from Nishigo, at 48 times, and broccoli from Iitate, at 27.8 times.High levels of radioactive iodine were found in 21 samples, including shinobu-fuyuna from Kawamata, at 11 times the safety limit, and spinach from Tamura, at 9.5 times.In Ibaraki Prefecture, iodine 5.7 times higher than acceptable levels was discovered in milk in Mito, and iodine 6.0 times higher in parsley grown in greenhouses in Hokota and Namegata.Children are especially vulnerable to iodine, which can concentrate in the thyroid gland and cause thyroid cancer if taken in large quantities.The permissible level of iodine exposure is 1 millisievert per year at normal times. But during emergencies, the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan sets the maximum level for iodine concentrated in the thyroid gland at 50 millisieverts per year.The levels of iodine in shinobu-fuyuna in Kawamata, at 22,000 Bq per kilogram, correspond to exposure at 7 millisieverts per year for adults, 33 millisieverts for young children and 62 millisieverts for infants.This means an infant who consumed 800 grams of this vegetable would have already reached the permissible level for a year. ( ouch color....sorry for that) Looks like  one doesn't have to consume tonnes of milk and spinach and banana ( sorry sanku couldn't resist) before crossing limits meant for years in few days. Radioactive substance , Besides  being accumulative in nature, its half life is less understood and t much maligned concept. I means  period withing which it decays to half of its original  mass. That means , if you get  10 mg of caesium after 30 years you will be left with 5 mg radioactive caesium unless body finds a way to excrete  it . This does not include additional ingestion which may take place due to contamination)After the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the former Soviet Union in 1986, many children developed thyroid cancer after drinking iodine-polluted milk for a long time.""Infants and young children are especially vulnerable to the impact of radioactive substances, compared with adults, because of the active metabolism in their bodies as they grow up,"" said Masamichi Nishio, director of the Hokkaido Cancer Center and a specialist of radiology. ""Those 40 years or older do not have to worry about thyroid cancer because their metabolism is slow.""Meanwhile, cesium in kukitachina from Motomiya was measured at 82,000 Bq per kilogram, corresponding to radiation exposure at 1.31 millisieverts per year.That means intake of 3.8 kilograms of the leafy vegetable would exceed the annual limit of 5 millisieverts set by the Nuclear Safety Commission.Much of the cesium taken into the body is discharged, but it has a long half-life period of two to 30 years. Did some one say Risk vs benefit and the informed consent for acceptable risk determined  and willingness to take that risk to avail the benefit.  Some important elements are missing in Radiation business."

The concept of ""acceptable"" risks in this case is a big HUGE red herring...The way you are looking at it seems to be as if these risks are ""inherent"" to nuke power plants...Fact is that these data (and I will come to it in the next point) are a result of a debilitating double whammy natural disaster - a black swan scale at that...Would release of MIC in Bhopal in the air constitute ""acceptable risk""? No, right? But we havent gone ahead and closed every chemical plant in India, and indeed the world? Studies apparently show lasting effects of the disaster on health and environment even today..So lets not confuse the fallout of an accident with ""acceptable risk norms""...As to BAU scenarios, I think enough material has been posted here by various people to show how almost all energy sources have their issues, some more than nuclear power...2. The doomsday data being quoted by the media...First, governments in these situations would always be cautious, and take an extreme conservative view...Two, the media would be looking for the ""worst"" data points -thats what sells...Therefore to conclude right now on the merits of nuke power or otherwise (or even more bizarrely, which I dont think you do, to announce that LWRs are riskier than PHWRs) based on running data now makes no sense...A few months later, when the crisis has blown away, there is sure to be extensive analysis of the data to find out what happened, what was dangerous and what wasnt..It will continue for decades...Till then, whats the point in arriving at definitive conclusions?"

584,mahen,24 Mar 2011 17:39 ,"My First Post: HelloThanks for a very informative discussion. Learnt a few things here. Some points i would like to make and queries to put in: I was on board a ship of Japan's NE coast around 200 km from the epicenter. Personally did'nt feel a thing because Tsunami wavelength at deep sea is several kms, rising in amplitude only near the rising continental shelf. Few hours on i was coasting between Hokkaido and Honshu's north, so was not affected a bit. Radiation levels in the air are pretty much low and there's been more scare IMO than there should be. Primarlily due to lack of understanding on radiation levels, nuclear plant construction/ workings, risk analysis etc. But all coverage is centered around for safety of people living onshore and not on millions that live off shore for a living. As an Engineer myself i do understand the chances of the containment being breached are low, however i understand they've been using sea water to directly cool the fuel rods. Thus the highly radioactive elements would have passed on to the sea water which in turn has been pumped into the Pacific..(?) as i understand. That sea water is used on board our ships for coolers, generating Fresh water through reverse osmosis etc including mundane activity like cleaning weather decks etc. As we intend our voyage from China presently to the US to pass through these areas..what possibly are the risks associated with the use of such water on board a ship at sea? Would like opinions on that. There's also a radioactive cloud i see from the NY Times graph chart all over off the Kuril, Bering Sea right upto the US (the route i'll be taking next couple of weeks). Any hazards or precautions that could be taken by those on board? Thanks."

586,Amber G.,24 Mar 2011 18:27 ,"Those who are  issuing fatawa's against  ""Banana nonsense"", IMO,  are missing two important points:1. Simple math is important:  2 banana + 2 banana = 4 banana  also means it is not a nonsense to question some one if some one  tells of 2 apples + 2 apples = 500 apples.. just because an apple is not a banana!What is relevant here:2 rem + 2 rem  is  4 rem and is NOT 500 remAnd what is REALLY need to be understood.A  radiation dose of 500 rem, will likely (more than 50% chance that you will die, if not treated, within 60 days) kill you. While a dose of 4 rem - No one knows but There is NO measurable effect  (on provable increase risk). (Cancer risk  from smoking, or >100 rem exposures are much better understood)  Since no one knows, we side with caution. We don't take x-rays, if we don't have to.. butavoiding x-ray because you  are scared of nuke bomb is not healthy.2. Understand that ""EM"" of ""REM"" stands for ""equivalent  (in) men""Yes sodium in banana is different than Tc from NPP .. the energies (not to mention type) of radiation is different but we are not talking  of taste of banana we are talking about the radiation effects in human body Since different radiation damage human  body differently, scientists use rem (vs rad - raw radiation) so that (with complicated formula between rad and rem) one can measure""how damage it will due to human body""IOW when one says 1 Rem (from Banana) is same as 1 Rem (from Cs) what one meansThe radiation danger (in human body) from them is same.  (As I have been VERY careful in my previous posts... I posted the radiation in Banana is from K40 -- AND is .01 mRem)So while banana is not the same as NPP, and K is not the same as Tc -- we were taking about radiation danger.. bed is just a unit of radiation not the kind of banana Hope this helps."

The cooling is done by de-mineralized water in a closed loop circuit that is cooled by Sea water. The sea water is treated and then discharged. I might be wrong here but the 'impression' i have gathered is that demineralized water has evaporated and the primary and secondary coolant used has been sea water. I have no report if the sea water used for cooling (tons of it per minute?) has been treated during the emergency. As i am not aware of the workings of the BWR the above might be pure speculation and misreading. If anyone has an idea please do share.

Apart from this increase, there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure two decades after the accident. There is no scientific evidence of increases in overall cancer incidence or mortality rates or in rates of non-malignant disorders that could be related to radiation exposure. The incidence of leukaemia in the general population, one of the main concerns owing to the shorter time expected between exposure and its occurrence compared with solid cancers, does not appear to be elevated. Although those most highly exposed individuals are at an increased risk of radiation-associated effects, the great majority of the population is not likely to experience serious health consequences as a result of radiation from the Chernobyl accident.**ConclusionsThe accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986 was a tragic event for its victims, and those most affected suffered major hardship. Some of the people who dealt with the emergency lost their lives. Although those exposed as children and the emergency and recovery workers are at increased risk of radiation-induced effects, the vast majority of the population need not live in fear of serious health consequences due to the radiation from the Chernobyl accident. For the most part, they were exposed to radiation levels comparable to or a few times higher than annual levels of natural background, and future exposures continue to slowly diminish as the radionuclides decay. Lives have been seriously disrupted by the Chernobyl accident, but from the radiological point of view, generally positive prospects for the future health of most individuals should prevail.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks ..

Whether the radiation seeping into the atmosphere has been more or whats been absorbed by water. Assuming it has been untreated sea water (highly rich in minerals) that has been absorbing the decay heat from the fuel rods all along the emergency. I thought they used de-mineralized water as primary coolant specifically for the purpose to reduce radiation due to minerals being present in 'normal' water. I stand to be corrected in all the assumptions. Many ship board systems too use demineralized water as primary coolant and sw as secondary coolant. There are emergency provisions for cooling with sw if the primary option fails. So i might be drawing wrong analogies here as far as BWRs go..but if sw has been used as a primary coolant and a secondary coolant, it should be contaminated to quite a degree. Possibly more than vented hydrogen carries through to the atmosphere (?)"

That means that there are 100 pieces of which only 20 are needed to complete the puzzle and cause the cancer. Different combinations of the 20 may work to cause cancer.Radiation is only one of those 100 pieces. Nobody knows exactly why radiation may cause cancer. Nobody knows exactly why radiation fails to cause cancer in others. After a point medical science is shooting in the dark. They have found about 15 of the 100 pieces of jigsaw and have no clue about what is going on exactly.As a boy I agonized over cancer because my mother underwent radiation for a non cancerous condition (It was fashionable in those days to use radiation for all sorts of rubbish). I worried for many years that my mother would die of leukaemia. She died of ripe old age. On the other hand - another person, close to me, underwent the same radiation treatment in his 30s and died 30 years later with an unusual manifestation of a cancer that happened to occur in the path of the radiation that was used. No one can be sure that it was the radiation that did it. He had been a a smoker for 40 years, but I and that man's descendants will die with the suspicion that it was the radiation that did it.The rakshasa who causes cancer uses bullets of many calibers - ranging from 2.2 to 5.56 to 7.62 to 9 mm to 12.7, 23, 27, 30mm etc. Radiation is one of them. Nobody can predict whether a cancer will occur from just the single 30 mm or whether you need to take several hits from 2.2 or some other combination. Nobody knows if the 30 mm will blow off a leg but the man survives but another man dies after taking several hits from different but smaller calibers on the battle field.Shivji - To add to you, the effects of  radiation at lower level (say less than 100 rem) is even less known (even after 50 years of study)..Cancer due to smoking ..or >100 rem we have good models and data. I used the the term Ld50 dose etc.. For smaller amount of radiation we don't even know if it has effect (or negative effect)..Cancer rates on many places which has high background radiation is actually less..most likely because of other environmental  factors. After New Delhi  C-60 Incident, I ran some calculations to decide  what I will do if there was a dirty bomb  which went off in my neighborhood. ...

It is paid copyrighted one so not posting in full. Only citation abstract.Keywords:caesium-137;ionising radiation;nuclear power;low dose;epidemiology;environment;background radiation;cancer;GIS;cohortAbstractBackgroundAfter the Chernobyl accident in 1986, as much as 5% of the released caesium-137 was deposited in Sweden due to a heavy rainfall 2 days after the event. A study of increased incidence of malignancies was initiated after the accident.MethodsThe cohort included 1,137,106 inhabitants who were 0–60 years old in 1986 and lived in 8 counties of Sweden with the highest fallout of caesium-137. With the dwelling coordinate, GIS-technique and a digital map on caesium-137, each individual was matched for the exposure. Adjustments were made for several potential confounding factors. During the follow-up 33,851 malignancies was recorded 1988–1999.ResultsExposure categories were: 0–8 (reference), 9–23, 24–43, 44–66, 67–84, and ≥85 nGy/hr. The corresponding adjusted Mantel-Haenszel incidence rate ratios for total malignancies during follow-up amounted to 1.000, 0.997, 1.072, 1.114, 1.068, 1.125, respectively. The excess relative risk per 100 nGy/hr with the same adjustments and time period was 0.042 95% confidence limit 0.001;0.084. An excess for thyroid cancer or leukemia could not be ruled out.ConclusionIncreased incidence of total malignancies possibly related to the fallout from the Chernobyl accident is seen.This is what is contested hotly by many.One point I would like to make here is that deaths related to nuclear accident ( attributed to it) are unlike train accident deaths. Some may die of accidents due to  blast at plant or may not. Few might die of exposure beyond limits, while many would die later of various reasons .Scientific studies exists to show that those deaths  are so  removed that causative link with radiation is difficult to establish based on certain radiation risk models. On the contrary seperate body of Scientific studies exist which tend to link themI was surprised to find that regulatory authorities revised minimum safe radiation limits ( many concepts are explained in detail in the link) based on emerging evidences which could not be refuted by established conventional wisdom.  the exposure levels permitted by policymakers have continuously been readjusted throughout the last 80 years as every new discovery both in science and in epidemiology has shown that radiation exposure is more dangerous than previously thought. This process of discovery continues today although the dose limits are stuck at their 1990 levels. This is because the current official radiation risk models have not incorporated the most recent discoveries since to do so would force a complete reappraisal of the current use of nuclear power and the historic harm done by releases of radioactivity in the past Contemporary radiation risk models are so inaccurate for internal exposures that even some official risk agencies (IRSN) have pointed this out: yet they continue to be employed by governments and used by polluters to justify their past and present behaviour. There is now sufficient scientific proof of this in peer reviewed publish literature.  The weight of scientific belief about the dangers from internal radiation began to change in the mid 1990s with interest on the increasing evidence from nuclear site  clusters   and Chernobyl effects which clearly showed that the contemporary risk models were somehow false by a very large amount. Between about 1996 and 2000,  evidence began to emerge from the laboratory for genomic and bystander effects Since the then current ICRP model was based on genetic damage and a linear relation it was implicit by 2000 that this basis was completely incorrect. This, and various  other epidemiological evidence (which had now to be re-assessed) led to the  Committee Examining Radiation Risks from Internal Emitters and the ‘Radiation Science Wars’ of the early 2000s. The critical impact of the 2003 report of the European Committee on Radiation Risk, and the clear demonstrations in  epidemiological evidence from the Chernobyl; affected territories (infant leukem minisatellite mutations, cancer in Sweden, Belarus and Ukraine) that the ECRR predictions were close to what was seen was a turning point in a paradigm shift that continues today.  It is so clear to a rational audience that I have persuaded all of the courts or  juries that I have given presentations to. It is only the biased scientists of the nuclear  military  project and the economic and military vested interests that continue to support the conventional model. Part of the problem is that the area of radiation risk in not one area but many. Each expert or employee sees only part of the picture. The physicist sees the world as energy transfer and mathematics. The epidemiologist sees  the effects but doesn’t understand the physics and assumes absorbed dose is a real  parameter, a given. This was the problem with the late Sir Richard Doll, who I spoke  with about this. Doll based everything on absorbed dose and died believing that the Sellafield leukaemia cluster was not of radiological origin. The biochemist also  assumes absorbed dose is meaningful but here we are approaching reality if we are  prepared to think through the ionisations and their position on the target DNA. I  met very few experts in this field who see the whole picture; yet it is the whole picture that is necessary if one wishes to understand the issue. Each expert is an expert in one  filed, and can pass the buck: the epidemiologist says that the cancers are there but  they cant be due to radiation because the physicists say the dose is too low. The late  Martin Gardner, the Sellafield epidemiologist,  tried to get round the dose problem by assuming it was dose to the fathers sperm that was the trouble: he never questioned the paradigm, he never questioned is dose was a real thing. The physicists in their turn use dose: they invented it. They say that the Hiroshima studies show the cancers are  only there when the dose is high, but they don’t see the chemistry, they don’t know the stuff gets inside you and binds to the DNA they aren’t interested in such messy stuff, you cant use mathematics there.  No one asks the chemists because why would they? The chemists do chemistry? What do they know about dose?  But if dose isn’t appropriate or real (and it isn’t) the whole house of cards collapses The LSS were not begun until 1952. This was another flaw, since seven years of epidemiological data would be missing from the study and in addition, those selected into the study would have been healthy survivors: many of the victims of radiation would have died in the five years before the study began (Stewart and Kneale, 2000). It is clear from [b]reports of Japanese scientists that there were many deaths and leukemias occurring in the irradiated cities in the interim period and studies of the increases in cancers in the cities using external control data give higher cancer yields than the LSS yields which effectively employed internal controls[/b] (Kusano 1953, Busby 1995, Busby 2006, Sawada 2009). Long before then America's Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) urgently needed to regulate the growing nuclear industry. The AEC pressed the National Council for Radiation Protection (NCRP) to develop safety standards. An especial concern was the quantity of novel elements which, being alpha emitters, would present internal radiation hazards. Separate sub-committees addressed internal and external radiation. The external sub-committee completed its work quite quickly but the other was slowed down by the many complexities of internal contamination. The problem is that while physicists can tell you the ergs from any radioactive decay, they don't have much clue about where internal radioactivity goes inside the body, how long it stays there or what biological damage it's doing. Impatient with the delays, NCRP's Executive closed down the internal committee in 1951, and stretched the report of the external committee to cover internal radiation.  The problem in the court of scientific opinion (and indeed in a court of law) with cancer causation is that there is generally a time lag between cause and effect, and since there are many mutagenic causes, it is difficult to make a connection which is unassailable in logic. In the case of the Sellafield childrens’ leukemia (and other similar clusters) despite the fact that they lived near the most radioactively polluted site in Europe, and that radiation is the only known cause of childhood leukemia, it was argued that the ICRP Hiroshima model did not predict the risk and so it must have been something else.Sorry for the long post, OT wrt title of the thread."

Mathematics some times does get hard, and  jargons (if not familiar) are some times a problem, that is why I was trying to explain many things in layman's term without losing accuracy. You will find that is is very consistent with every  thing  I have posted so far.(Actually numbers here are very similar to some of the problems I have given in past to my students to do calculations to help them in their understanding)  You and others may like to analyze (basic understanding of scientific , and statistics terms  may help if you already  not familiar with) to put results/conclusion in perspective:ResultsExposure categories were: 0–8 (reference), 9–23, 24–43, 44–66, 67–84, and ≥85 nGy/hr. The corresponding adjusted Mantel-Haenszel incidence rate ratios for total malignancies during follow-up amounted to 1.000, 0.997, 1.072, 1.114, 1.068, 1.125, respectively. The excess relative risk per 100 nGy/hr with the same adjustments and time period was 0.042 95% confidence limit 0.001;0.084. An excess for thyroid cancer or leukemia could not be ruled out.ConclusionIncreased incidence of total malignancies possibly related to the fallout from the Chernobyl accident is seen.(...understanding mathematical use of  the terms  like relative risk %, confidence limit - nGY/hr etc.. and also   evaluate, added risk like .042% in practical terms.. when total risk due to cancer is in the 20% range for some of this population. - For perspective how does .042% compares with risk due to traffic accident?/ smoking one extra pack?)That .042%  per 100nGy/Hr value is indeed  a value I have used!  (some people use different unit(s).. people generally, now  use Sv (instead of Gy) for biological effect studies.  Difference between Gy and Sv is similar to one betweenrad and rem) As I said and repeated here many time, risk due to doses less than 100 rem is very hard to measure .. much less conclusive data,  so we do our best and go on the side of caution.. our "" safe value limits"" are  100 or 1000x   smaller ... (Even for emergency and fire fighters we don't allow 100 rem/hr) The ""panic"" comes when some one notices level  ""10 times safe levels"", we certainly should worry about it,  but should be smart enough not to panic.. the death due to panic heart attack is much much more that even the elevated value.. (NO this is not a number just thrown out , there is lot of thought and calculation and medical evidence behind it) Hope this helps.Again what I am saying is: look at the numbers."

(some people use different unit(s).. people generally, now  use Sv (instead of Gy) for biological effect studies.

There were 6 bins of exposure 0–8, 9–23, 24–43, 44–66, 67–84, and ≥85 nGy/hr2. The incidence rates normalized to first bin were: 1.000, 0.997, 1.072, 1.114, 1.068, 1.1253. From this they conclude that at 95% confidence level, there is an excess risk of 0.042 per 100 nGy/hr.4. It is not .042%, but 4.2% (normalized to an exposure of <8 nGy/hr).My critique:1. No error bars are presented, so it is difficult to judge the significance of this excess.2. They report 4 significant figures, so one would be forced to conclude that getting 67-84 nGy/hr is healthier than getting a smaller dose of 44-64 nGy/hr. /big smile/Basically, the statistical treatment looks suspect. I am not going to read 116 pages to find out how they set the 95% CL -- is it a frequentist approach? Why have they not presented error bars? What about systematic errors? If Chanakya-ji or anyone else who claims to have read the paper has any answers, we would all be enlightened.In the meantime, I will regard this analysis as amateurish and inexact.  The data trend can barely be distinguished from noise."

653,chaanakya,25 Mar 2011 14:08 ,"High radiation leak suggests damage to No. 3 reactor vessel: agencyFriday 25th March, 03:05 PM JSTFUKUSHIMA —A high-level radiation leak detected Thursday at one of six troubled reactors at the crisis-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant indicates possible damage to the reactor’s vessel, pipes or valves, the government’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said Friday.Three workers at the No. 3 reactor’s turbine building, connected to the reactor building, were exposed Thursday to water containing radioactive materials 10,000 times the normal level, with two of them taken to hospital due to possible radiation burns to their feet, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) said.Electrical engineering firm Kandenko Co, for which the two hospitalized employees worked, said its workers were not required to put on boots as its safety manuals did not assume a scenario where its employees conduct work soaked in water at a nuclear power plant. They were working in the basement of the reactor’s turbine building when they were irradiated.Two of the three have been hospitalized due to possible burns caused by beta rays which can cause major skin damage.TEPCO said almost no water was present during an on-site inspection the previous day and also that the level of radiation was low during the inspection.‘‘Because of this, the workers were believed to have continued their work even after their dosimeters’ alarm went off, assuming a problem with the machine,’’ a TEPCO official said.The two hospitalized workers were transferred Friday to the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Chiba City for closer examination from Fukushima Medical University hospital.Meanwhile, Hidehiko Nishiyama, spokesman for the governmental nuclear regulatory body, told a press conference, ‘‘At present, our monitoring data suggest the (No. 3) reactor retains certain containment functions, but there is a good chance that the reactor has been damaged.’‘Nishiyama said the high-level radiation is suspected to have originated from the reactor, where overheating fuel rods are believed to have been partially melted, or a boiling pool that stores spent nuclear fuel, both of which are located in the reactor’s building.Following the radiation exposure incident, the nuclear agency ordered TEPCO to improve radiation management at the power station, where Japan’s worst nuclear crisis is unfolding. The operator began removing the highly radioactive water from the site.The spokesman said further verification is needed to find out how the radioactive water reached the underground site. Huge volumes of water have been poured into the reactor and the pool in the No. 3 reactor building, which was substantially damaged by a hydrogen blast on March 14.Despite the partial halt of restoration work at the troubled plant due to the technicians’ radiation exposure incident, TEPCO on Friday prepared for the injection of freshwater into the No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 reactor cores and spent fuel pools, instead of seawater currently used.As a step to bring the reactors under control, authorities are eager to replace seawater with fresh water in cooling the reactor cores and the pools, as crystallized salt could form a crust on the fuel rods and prevent smooth water circulation, thus diminishing the cooling effect.Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa said Friday U.S. forces will supply some of the fresh water to be pumped into reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools at the crisis-hit Fukushima Daiichi power plant.Kitazawa said at a news conference the United States has strongly urged that fresh water be used early in place of seawater because salt in seawater causes corrosion of equipment at the nuclear plant.U.S. forces will begin supplying the water probably early next week, Kitazawa said at a press conference.According to the Defense Ministry, two U.S. warships carrying fresh water will be towed by a Maritime Self-Defense Force warship to Onahama port in Fukushima Prefecture from the U.S. Yokosuka base in Kanagawa Prefecture."
654,chaanakya,25 Mar 2011 14:16 ,"High radiation detected in water at plantTokyo Electric Power Company says it has detected high levels of radioactive substances in water that 3 workers were exposed to at the troubled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.The company says 3.9 million becquerels of radioactive substances per cubic centimeter were detected in the water that the workers were standing in. That is 10,000 times higher than levels of the water inside a nuclear reactor in operation.The level of radioactive cerium-144 was 2.2 million becquerels. Also, 1.2 million becquerels of iodine-131 was measured. These substances are generated during nuclear fission inside a reactor.Tokyo Electric says damage to the No.3 reactor and spent nuclear fuel rods in a storage pool may have produced the highly radioactive water.On Thursday, 2 of the 3 workers were taken to hospital after being exposed to 173 to 180 millisieverts of radiation while standing in 15-centimeters of water in the turbine building adjacent to the reactor. A third worker was also exposed to the higher-level radiation but did not require treatment."

656,chaanakya,25 Mar 2011 14:22 ,"Japan nuclear plant remains precarious, but not as serious as Chernobyl: expertsThe troubled nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan could suffer more damage and leak more radiation, but it is unlikely to get out of hand and spark a catastrophe resembling the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, experts say.Experts believe that one of the reactors at the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant poses the biggest danger while other reactors apparently have calmed down.""What we are worried about most is the No. 1 reactor in which temperature and pressure are rising. The No 2 and 3 reactors seem to have escaped danger,"" Haruki Madarame, head of the government's Nuclear Safety Commission, said at a news conference on the evening of March 23 while making clear that that was his personal opinion.According to the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, the temperature in the pressure vessel of the No. 1 reactor housing nuclear fuel rose to 400 degrees Celsius on March 23. The assumed maximum limit of the temperature in the pressure vessel is 302 degrees Celsius. If the high temperature remains intact for an extended period of time, the pressure vessel could be damaged.As a result of increasing the water injected into the reactor, steam was created, paving the way for the pressure in the pressure vessel to build up further. The amount of water being used to cool down nuclear rods is believed to be insufficient.Tadashi Narabayashi, professor of reactor engineering at Hokkaido University, said the reactor container of the No. 1 reactor could be damaged. ""The temperature of 400 degrees Celsius in the pressure vessel is abnormal. The hydrogen created in the process of the reaction between the fuel cladding that holds nuclear rods and water in the container at high temperatures is believed to have built up both in the pressure vessel and the reactor container,"" said Narabayashi. ""If hydrogen is leaked out, it could spark an explosion and damage the reactor container, releasing massive amounts of radioactive substances,"" he added.With the water level dropping, the nuclear fuel could melt in the overheating reactor, allowing for the melted fuel to leak from some weak structures such as the control rod system. ""The bottom of the pressure vessel will not easily break open. There is only a small possibility of more serious hydrogen explosions being sparked because the quantity is small,"" said Narabayashi.Experts say it is unlikely for the reactor to have ""re-criticality"" -- a nuclear fission chain reaction. ""Nuclear fuel is made in such a way that fission reaction is triggered most easily in its ordinary state. It's hard to imagine that criticality will be reached with melted fuel,"" said Keiji Kobayashi, former lecturer of reactor physics at Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute. Narabayashi shares similar views.In the case of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, a running reactor using flammable graphite ignited a hydrogen explosion that blew off its pressure vessel, scattering a massive amount of nuclear substances. But the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant automatically shut down immediately after the March 11 earthquake, and no graphite was used in the reactors there.""We can definitely say that something like Chernobyl will not happen,"" said Narabayashi."
657,chaanakya,25 Mar 2011 14:27 ,"Salt buildup likely to harm pumping system before reactor, expert says While the buildup of salt from seawater pumped in to cool reactors at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant may become a concern, it is likely to affect the pumping system itself before it affects the fuel rods, one expert said Thursday.""In the core, it's probably not that great of a concern because it's going to be pretty hot in there,"" and the salt is likely to melt before the core reaches a dangerous temperature, said Gary Was, a nuclear engineering expert at the University of Michigan.<snip>""For almost two weeks now, we've been injecting about 100 gallons a minute of seawater into these reactors,"" said Michael Friedlander, a former senior plant operator at three U.S. nuclear power plants who has been following the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. He spoke on CNN's ""AC360"" Wednesday night.The salt left behind ""is now plating on surfaces inside the reactor vessel, as well as settling in the bottom of the reactor,"" he said.Both Friedlander and Was pointed out that it's too soon to tell, given a lack of detailed information and instrumentation at the reactor, whether the salt crystals are a problem.But, Was pointed out, salt itself liquefies at 800 degrees Celsius (1,472 degrees Fahrenheit). That is below the temperature at which zirconium fuel rods would oxidize and crack open, exposing the fuel. Oxidation becomes a self-sustaining process at about 900 degrees Celsius (1,652 degrees Fahrenheit). So, he said, it is likely the salt would melt and liquefy before that point is reached.Where buildup could be a problem, he said, is in the system pumping in the cooler seawater, where lower temperatures are the norm.Still, ""this is uncharted territory,"" Was said, ""so nobody really knows what the situation is in there, but we can make sort of educated guesses.""<snip>The seawater is being pumped into the cores of reactors No. 1 through 4 at the Fukushima plant in an effort to cool them and to replenish the spent fuel pools in at least two reactors.Normally, seawater is about 3.5% salt, Was said.In both the reactors and the spent fuel pools, the salt left behind as the seawater boils off is potentially concentrating the mixture, Friedlander said."
658,chaanakya,25 Mar 2011 16:10 ,"I think there is some misunderstanding  because I posted two different articles that shows that members are not paying attention while reading it and replying just to reply based on their preconceived notions., hardly a scientific attitude or approach.One is a research study conducted by Swedish scientists  done in Gavle  and published in 2006. Title is self evident. It deals with increased malignancies in Sweden after Chernobyl. It is a pear reviewed publication and concludes that higher malignancies have been noticed when compared in sample /control groups. Guru's point relate to that and he is entitled to his opinion. The study serve a limited purpose to show that counter data points do exist and researched and reported. The other one is an article written  by an expert , who has conducted several studies. This deals with radiation, its impact, safe levels etc. It indeed cites several studies by Russian and Japanese Scientists and explains the reason for errors in safe radiation limits as regulated by govt agencies based on ICRP. This paper shows that safe radiation limits have been revised by regulatory authorities several times as and when evidences have emerged of radiation hazards. It also shows relations between these changes and occurances of new evidences. The paper also points out that since 1990 the level has not been revised due to various reasons despite new evidences emerging which have been , so far, ignored by Nuclear industrial complex.Nevertheless, the requirements of military research for bombs caused pressure on the regulators. Limits were slightly relaxed, allowing the period of averaging of dose to be extended to 13 weeks, so long as the total dose to any organ accumulated during a period of 13 consecutive weeks does not exceed ten times the basic permissible dose. This introduced the concept of the integrated dose: but note that this new dose limit permitted an annual dose of up to an enormous 1560mSv. Pressure built up: research results leaked out. Fallout Strontium began to show up in childrens’ milk. The doses were again revised in 1958 when ICRP considered the exposure of individuals in a number of categories. For the highest risk category, ICRP recommended a new weekly limit of 0.1rem (1mSv) or 52mSv in a year with a proviso that not more than 3 rems (30mSv) were delivered in 13 weeks. It  also points out to ICRP risk assessment model which shows significant divergences in numbers. The numbers obtained through ECRR model , he claims , is nearer to what was reported by Russian and Japanese studies which have been studiously ignored by conventional  wisdom. ICRP model is based on Study of Hiroshima and hence called Hiroshima model sponsored by USAFunded and controlled by the USA, data on the survivors' health was gathered (as it still is) in what have become known as the Life Span Studies or LSS.  The LSS were not begun until 1952. This was another flaw, since seven years of epidemiological data would be missing from the study and in addition, those selected into the study would have been healthy survivors: many of the victims of radiation would have died in the five years before the study began (Stewart and Kneale, 2000). It is clear from reports of Japanese scientists that there were many deaths and leukemias occurring in the irradiated cities in the interim period and studies of the increases in cancers in the cities using external control data give higher cancer yields than the LSS yields which effectively employed internal controls (Kusano 1953, Busby 1995, Busby 2006, Sawada 2009). Long before then America's Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) urgently needed to regulate the growing nuclear industry. The AEC pressed the National Council for Radiation Protection (NCRP) to develop safety standards. An especial concern was the quantity of novel elements which, being alpha emitters, would present internal radiation hazards. Separate sub-committees addressed internal and external radiation. I am sure there are studies from both sides and numbers to support the contentions. The only point which I wish to make here is that matter is not settled.The other side has equal right to present its point of view without being derided."

Appealing to authority is a weak case in science.  Present it cogently, doesn't matter if it happens to be from a non-professor from LMU.What is important is aspects that a physicist should be able to explain to a layman in simple terms - rule is clearly violated here.  Also, unless one can condense the esoteric matter to make it accessible to lay readers then one can indulge in cat fights in conferences where physicists or other august members routinely engage in, say such as International conferences etc.  This fora is not a show of strengths (/or lack of it) for the scientists, they better duke it out where it matters. Journal papers? International conference publications?  Other arenas meant for that.But beyond that, unfortunately even on a scientific topic, there is way too much noise and unnecessary sniping, unwarranted insinuations while forgetting to expend energy in explaining things cleanly to layman.  Just my 2 cents.  Happy sniping."

The incidence rates normalized to first bin were: 1.000, 0.997, 1.072, 1.114, 1.068, 1.1253. From this they conclude that at 95% confidence level, there is an excess risk of 0.042 per 100 nGy/hr.4. It is not .042%, but 4.2% (normalized to an exposure of <8 nGy/hr).My critique:1. No error bars are presented, so it is difficult to judge the significance of this excess.2. They report 4 significant figures, so one would be forced to conclude that getting 67-84 nGy/hr is healthier than getting a smaller dose of 44-64 nGy/hr. /big smile/Basically, the statistical treatment looks suspect.

That is the down side of Google. With a key word, you can search up even the most bizarre and wacky theories on anything and even the voices and opinions of absolute nutcases and frankly media shock jocks with the bullhorn (but no brains behind that bullhorn, like the classic DDM) get lots of hits and airtime. So let it slide. There is nothing much you can do with people who are convinced that the milk with iodine/Cs from  Fukushima is going to kill 4000000000 people , while in reality the exhaust from an idling car /truck (even if Euro V) or tobacco , even as 2nd hand , 3rd hand smoke and other forms kills some hundreds of orders more people every year in every part of the world  and hence that is a far more REAL deadly killer than any radiation simply cannot register with them.In fact, the closest parallel I can see is the scare mongering with vaccines. It is very similar to the Fatwa some nitwits issued against the Polio vaccine in India and a few other countries with large muslim population as a ""Joo Kansipracy"" to ""sterlize"" muslim children and the result being that probably couple of 1000 innocent children fell victim to polio and the disease is still not eradicated in India (probably next year I pray we see zero cases) and the world, despite heroic efforts and funding from everyone from GOI, to WHO to Bill Gates. Is there a chance of someone getting a polio from vaccine, you bet , one in a couple of millions maybe, is there a chance that a child in UP/Bihar/Bengal WILL GET polio if not innoculated, absolutely ,with orders of magnitude more probability than getting polio from the vaccine!The scare mongering with the MMR vaccine and autism is another case in point.  The DDM and the bull horners can't perceive subtleties and uncertainties and the probabilistic math. The are the quick headlines , one liner consuming types. I would suggest the best way to respond to  ""Oh my gosh. Radiation in Tokyo's water and milk ! How awful"" is by saying.. ""Awful indeed. But, Oh my gosh! Carcinogens and radiation in  fossil fuel emissions killed 400000000 people this year alone, while a grand total 100 people have died from leaked radiation from nuclear power plants in their entire history from all causes"" . That one sentence should be repeated ad nauseum in every post as a typical copy that gives ""background"" to the subject as the concluding paragraph after every one liner you write in response."

673,ramana,25 Mar 2011 22:15 ,Normal operating loads etc are considered nominal ie the average. The  plus/minus are the 3-sigma loads. From this one can extrapolate the 1:500 loads which means probability of 0.002 loads. Extremely critical systems (the Waldemort systems)) have even lower probabilities. However it very very difficult to anticipate extreme values with limited data. So one has to use imagination which is killed in regular engineering studies and then there are the accountants/bean counters who will blackball you for being conservative in your estimates.In mid 70s a Hydrology prof at IITM was using FFT on flood data to come up with 100 year flood design limits etc for weirs and gates. He was considered a nut for using FFT which was the domain of Electronics Engineer and not for lowly civil engineers!(I helped his grad student for it helped me learn to code FFT in Fortran and got some extra time on the IBM 370 in those days!)

Those indeed are estimates, however there is a limit beyond which you think the probability is so low that you stop worrying. However that doesn't mean that a 100m Tsunami or a Richter scale 20 earthquake cant happen , just because the probability is so low. Even a one in a million year event can happen (like the metorite that wiped out the dinosaurs) anytime within the 40 yr span (with a very low probability of course), but millions of dinosaurs that ruled the earth for millions of years saw it happen to them.ramana wrote:And modern Risk management couples those low probabilties with measures to mitigate the consequneces.Well, that is probably good for natural sciences /engg kind of field where the system is robust, replicable and lends to experimental verification and proof, but in Phynance and social ""sciences"" (I prefer Social Studies, there is no science in it, despite what the social studies snake oil salesmen would like you to believe), where they misapply that to fat tail sytems, you get black swans with alarming frequency and disastrous consequnces like the current global meltdown."

A 35 meter Tsunami has probably never happened EVER in recorded human history! Are you sure??Just read a few posts before.Japan has a history of tsunami wave reaching up to 38 mts. This bloomberg report says with link to USGSA 7.6-magnitude quake in 1896 off the east coast of Japan created waves as high as 38 meters, while an 8.6- magnitude temblor in 1933 led to a surge as high as 29 meters, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Geologist Masanobu Shishikura, a researcher under Okamura who has focused on the 869 tsunami, said he wasn’t surprised historical evidence wasn’t heeded to. When he presented to government officials from two towns on the coast north of Dai-Ichi, the urgency wasn’t clear even to him.Today, those towns of Higashi Matshushima and Ishinomaki lie in ruins.“At the time, we thought it was unfortunate they didn’t take us seriously, but we figured it was just a matter of making a better presentation,” Shishikura said. “If only the tsunami had waited a little longer, we might have been ready.”2004 Tsunami reportedly reached height of 30-34 mts.  2004 tsunami destroyed coastal town Banda Aceh completely   and tsunami penetrated upto 36 km inland. Distance ( arial) from Kalpakkam is 27 km approx. So if 35 mts tsunami, likes of what happened in Japan in 1896 or Indonesia in 2004, were to struck, we would have been unprepared precisely for that reason. No one would have blamed the engineers as there was no history. Tsunami-2004, when it reached Indian shores its height was about 2 to 6 mts at different places and believe me , even that was a horrifying sight.Additional searching the google chacha    tells me thishttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TsunamiThese phenomena rapidly displace large water volumes, as energy from falling debris or expansion transfers to the water at a rate faster than the water can absorb. Their existence was confirmed in 1958, when a giant landslide in Lituya Bay, Alaska, caused the highest wave ever recorded, which had a height of 524 metres (over 1700 feet). The wave didn't travel far, as it struck land almost immediately. Two people fishing in the bay were killed, but another boat amazingly managed to ride the wave. Scientists named these waves megatsunami."

However that doesn't mean that no one else in India or certain places in India didn't know if it and teach about it!Don't ask me how, but I can even after all these years  I can do actual calculations to predict wave heights at given locations for postulated conditions.For eg, I can tell you how much the wave height will be if a Tsunami were to hit Norway (theoretically) with its Fjords vs say Chennai with it's beaches.If you think that a Glacier falling off the coast of Mumbai/Chennai /Indonesia/Iran will trigger a 500ft Tsunami , well, I think the metorite falling will have a far higher probability.  About the more realistic thing of an earth quake induced one, any half educated (unless a LMU grad) who took those courses will tell you wave heights and surge levels in 5 minutes with a pencil and paper and bathymetric charts and knowledge of the coastline and shelf . In case you didnt know, the wave height is highly dependent on that and even something places that are just a couple of 100m apart along the coast can see very different wave heights and levels depending on that.In fact mutliple places would have recorded multiple wave heights depending on that from the same distance from the tsunami. If Fukushima was 12ms, some place close by could have seen maybe just 3 meters, someplace more! There is no one site fits all answer for sizing and design of anything and it is a custom study for site selection and design and everything for every plant."

It is not .042%, but 4.2% (normalized to an exposure of <8 nGy/hr).I mentioned NTLH before,  the part about 'normalized to' is something... well let me put this way.. no serious scientist think that there is any good  ( near100%) validity. Yeah.. there are different models, but as I said before,  effects due to doses less than 100 rem (that is 1,000,000,000 nGy!) are very little understood.  (At least I will not stick out my neck and claim something)That's why wild life in Chernobyl, or frogs in NK surprised every one.This, of course, does NOT mean (before people misunderstand and misquote me) that radiation less than that is safe (by any means). Dosimeters monitors doses of  million time less of this value, and there will be forced evacuation when the rate is hundred or thousand time less.It is just that we don't know have a very good model which works all the time. My critique:1. No error bars are presented, so it is difficult to judge the significance of this excess.2. They report 4 significant figures, so one would be forced to conclude that getting 67-84 nGy/hr is healthier than getting a smaller dose of 44-64 nGy/hr. /big smile/Yes.. those 4 sig figures (and no error bars) are absurd, (IMO)  to put it mildly."

710,Amber G.,26 Mar 2011 02:11 ,"^^^Thanks .. (Sorry if already posted) (Just posting so we have some numerical data in archives)  Fromhttp://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS_Exposures_and_progress_at_Fukushima_Daiichi_240311.html(Quoting in full)Exposures and progress at Fukushima Daiichi24 March 2011Three workers at Fukushima Daiichi have been exposed to higher levels of radiation, while steady progress is made on site and discharges to sea are monitored.  Workers make checks ahead of the reconnection of external powerThree contractors were installing cables in the first floor and basement of the turbine building of unit 3, having to standing in water that resulted in exposures of around 170 millisieverts to the skin on their legs. Two have been taken to hospital. The dose is higher than a commonly accepted value of 100 millisieverts for nuclear workers in an emergency situation, but less than the 250 millisieverts temporarily allowed by Japanese authorities. The World Health Organisation, however, said that a limit of 500 millisiverts is an international standard for emergency work. Another worker suffered an exposure of 106 milliseverts during venting work early in the Fukushima crisis, while six more have been confirmed to have received more than 100 millisieverts - and another between 100 and 150 millisieverts. Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) has not revealed the work these people had been carrying out. Injection of water to cool used fuel ponds in unit 3 continued today using the fuel pool cooling and filtering system. Tepco said it would consider spraying at other units subject to the conditions of the other units' fuel ponds. External power has now been connected to all six Fukushima Daiichi reactor units, while some checks are still being made before this can be used. Lights are now on in the control rooms of unit 1 and 3. Tepco noted that the temperature of the containment vessel of unit 1 had built to some 400ºC, compared to a design value of only 138ºC. However, the strength of the component is such that it can withstand the stresses this imposes, said Tepco, and its structural integrity is expected to be maintained. ""There is no substantial problem regarding the containment vessel's structural soundness under conditions of pressure 300 kPa and temperature 400ºC."" Releases to sea  There has been more detailed investigation of radioactive releases to sea, after elevated readings were taken on 22 March. Levels of iodine-131 well beyond normal regulatory limits were found about 330 metres south of the discharge channel of Fukushima Daiichi units 1 to 4. Levels of Caesium-137 were also beyond limits. North of the Daiichi plant the levels of iodine-131 were lower, but still far above limits. This was joined by caesium-137, caesium-134, tellurium-129 and tellurium-129m. At the Daini plant about ten kilometres to the south, only iodine-131 was found to be above levels. That plant suffered problems due to the tsunami that followed 11 March's earthquake but all four reactors reached cold shutdown status a few days later with no radiological release. Local people began evacuation more than ten days ago and this is complete to a 20 kilometre radius. People in a further ten-kilometre zone have been warned to stay indoors. Pills to block the potential negative health effects of iodine-131 have been distributed to evacuation centres. For perspective ..Exposures above  500  mSv are not allowed even for emergency workers...Above 3000-4000 mSv are life threatening (Ld50 dose is, as has been mentioned here quite a few times,  around this - that is,  if not treated 50% chance of death within 2 months)"

(Jump out of window/run or stay and take my chances)Take it FWIW, and I humbly request folks here,  not to take a pot-shot at me (OTOH criticism/comments on the numbers are welcome).  There are, IMO no ""right"" numbers. All units are in mSV.  Take these numbers as a guide and a rough guide only. - Whole-body dose of  1000 mSV (or less)  , you probably won’t notice.    (Body will repair most of the damage without ever making you sick) - Larger doses are worse.   - 2000 mSV - (You’ll get sick, (or may even die).  it is called ""radiation poisoning"" most of your  hair                          will fall out, nausea  and listless. etc ... You may have seen this if  you have seen some one undergoing radiation therapy. (usually to kill a cancer). You take this chance if  risk justifies the benefit. - 3000 mSV -  Chances of death are about 50%, unless you get blood transfusion etc.                     (Many references give 4500 mSV as Ld50 dose) -  10,000 mSV will kill you within hours.. even medical treatment is unlikely to help. Of course, amount of time, part of the body, your general health, age, and above all LUCK  can and will change this.Less than 1000mSV there are virtually no symptoms at all Hope this is helpful..BTW  for gamma rays -  To get 1 mSV  of radiation, your body must be exposed to approximately  1,000,000,000 gamma rays.  ( Just, in case you are listening to these Giger  counter clicks)Also for reference  1mSV = 100 mRem = 10,000 banana equivalent dose.(Again - by no means the above means that doses less than 1000mSV is safe (or will not  cause cancer).. it is just we can't say positively (in statistical way)  that it will - we go on side of caution.. normal safe level, even for nuclear plant workers,  are  in the range of  50 mSV. )"

Micro-faults are constantly being formed and merged or fused. They may not in themselves create tsunamis. On the other hand they may contribute to such phenomena as liquefaction.

More recent reports now put the cost at over 10,000 lives.  In total almost 320,000 people have been evacuated, with over 130,000 of these from Fukushima prefecture for reasons of both the tsunami and the nuclear emergency.  Over 220,000 homes are still without access to electricity, notwithstanding the non-operation of nuclear and fossil power plants. Gas supplies are disrupted to almost 440,000 homes. Some 1700 roads are damaged with many of these closed. More than 50 bridges are down. KI distribution:Japanese authorities have reported to the IAEA after examining the thyroid glands of 66 children, including 14 infants.

The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency has told the company to improve its radiation monitoring and the controls protecting workers that are bringing systems back online at Fukushima Daiichi. It is of course understandable that the lower part of the turbine building of unit 3, in which three workers were installing cables, had not been fully checked. But it is thought that contractors ignored alarms from their dosimeters, while ankle-deep in contaminated water for about three hours. They received doses of 170-180 millisieverts and seem to have suffered shallow burns to their skin from beta radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency said that 17 personnel have now received radiation doses of over 100 millisieverts. This level remains below an international standard of 500 millisieverts for emergencies, as well as a temporary limit of 250 millisieverts allowed by authorities in the current situation. Investigations are now underway into the unexpectedly high level of contamination in the water, particularly as the basement of the turbine building is not a recognised radiation area. One theory is that there is a leak from the reactor circuit, but pressures in the reactor vessel indicate this must be elsewhere in the loop. Despite this disappointment, steady progress continues to be made on site. Instrumentation is being recovered at units 1, 2 and 4 and lights are on in the control rooms of units 1 and 3. Power connections have reached all the units and checks are underway before normal systems can be re-energised. The shared pond for used fuel pond has now been reconnected. Freshwater is replacing seawater for injection to the reactor systems of units 1 and 3. This is to prevent salt accumulation and damage to main pumps, which Tepco hope to bring back into operation once checks are complete. Preparations are underway to use freshwater at unit 2 as well with all the supplies coming from Sakashita Dam. Water injection work has continued to the fuel ponds of units 2 and 4 using the pool cleaning and filtering systems, while unit 3 was sprayed by fire trucks. Tepco is maintaining a watch on all the fuel ponds and will continue to spray and inject as necessary. The residual heat removal system of cold shutdown unit 5 is now back in operation after a trip two days ago, although the loss of this did not threaten the reactor's cold shutdown status. External power for units 5 and 6 comes from diesel generators brought back into service. Source:http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS_Fukushima_Daiichi_two_weeks_on_2503111.html"

Radiation threats from northern Japan are worrying some top container shipping lines.By KEITH BRADSHERPublished: March 25, 2011  HONG KONG — The economic disruptions from Japan’s crisis have cascaded into another, crucial link in the global supply chain: cargo shipping.   Fearing the potential impact on crews, cargo and vessels worth tens of millions of dollars, some of the world’s biggest container shipping lines have restricted or barred their ships from calling on ports in Tokyo Bay over concerns about radiation from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Meantime, ports in China are starting to require strict radiation checks on ships arriving from Japan. And in California on Friday, the first ship to reach the Port of Long Beach since Japan’s earthquake was boarded and scanned for radiation by Coast Guard and federal customs officials before being allowed to dock.Big Japanese ports much farther south of Tokyo, like Osaka and Kobe, are still loading and unloading cargo. But the Tokyo Bay ports of Tokyo and Yokohama are normally Japan’s two busiest, representing as much as 40 percent of the nation’s foreign container cargo. If other shipping companies join those already avoiding the Tokyo area, as radiation contamination spreads from Fukushima Daiichi 140 miles north, the delays in getting goods in and out of Japan would only grow worse.The shipping industry’s fears have escalated since port officials in Xiamen, China, earlier this week detected radiation on a large container ship belonging to Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and quarantined the ship.  The vessel had sailed down Japan’s northeast coast and reportedly came no closer than 80 miles to the damaged nuclear power plant; the official Xinhua news agency said on Saturday afternoon that the vessel had left a berth at the port on Wednesday afternoon and then anchored briefly at sea.Hapag-Lloyd, a German container shipping line that is one of the world’s largest, halted service to Tokyo and Yokohama after the tsunami swamped Fukushima Daiichi. The shipper has not resumed service to those ports.“We put safety ahead of everything else,” said Eva Gjersvik, the company’s senior director for corporate communications, adding that the company was reviewing daily whether to resume sailings to Tokyo.Reuters reported that another German shipper, Claus-Peter Offen, has also stopped calling at Tokyo and Yokohama.OOCL, a shipping line based in Hong Kong, said late Friday that the company had decided to halt all traffic to Tokyo and Yokohama.OOCL will take Tokyo-bound containers to Osaka instead and send them overland from there, said Stanley Shen, the head of investor relations. The company has also drafted contingency plans to prevent its containers from traveling even overland to Tokyo if radiation levels increase in the Japanese capital, Mr. Shen added.Merchant vessels may have to be scrapped if quarantined even temporarily for radioactivity, because they would face extra coast guard checks for years at subsequent destinations, said Basil M. Karatzas, the managing director for projects and finance at Compass Maritime Services, a ship brokerage in Teaneck, N.J.The extra inspections make it hard to keep a schedule. “The charterers in the future will try to avoid the vessel because of the likelihood it will be delayed again,” Mr. Karatzas said.It is not only commercial ships that are giving the radiation region a wide berth.A senior nuclear executive said on Friday evening that the United States Navy had moved nuclear-powered vessels like the Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier far from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after officers became concerned that radiation from the plant could enter the ships’ air ducts.The worry is not that the radiation would pose a threat to the vessels’ crews, but that even trace contamination of the ducts could create problems in the extremely sensitive equipment aboard nuclear-powered vessels that is intended to detect any hint of a radioactive leak from onboard systems, said the executive, who insisted on anonymity to protect business connections.Shippers, even if they can avoid radiation exposure, know that cargo coming from Japan is now subject to new delays."

One level that was reported this week was high enough to suggest people in that area should be evacuated, an expert says. But he cautions that it's hard to draw conclusions about these spot measurements without more data.Today, Japanese officials told the population living up to 30 kilometers from the plant that they should consider leaving the area, expanding the previous 20-kilometer radius evacuation zone. But according to news reports, the advice stems from difficulties in supplying the region with food and water, not radiation levels.Meanwhile, on Wednesday the Japanese science ministry began to report measurements of cesium-137 in upland soil around the plant. The levels are highest from two points northeast of the plant, ranging from 8690 becquerels/kilogram to a high of 163,000 Bq/kg measured on 20 March from a point in Iitate about 40 kilometers northwest of the Fukushima plant.The soil measurements are more significant for evacuation purposes than radioactivity in the air, says nuclear engineer Shih-Yew Chen of Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, because cesium dust stays underfoot while air is transient. Levels of cesium-137 are also more important than soil readings of iodine-131, which is short-lived and more of a concern in milk and vegetables. ""It's the cesium that would prompt an evacuation,"" says Chen.Based on a rough estimate, a person standing on soil with 163,000 Bq/kg of cesium-137 would receive about 150 millisieverts per year of radiation, says Chen. This is well above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standard of 50 millisieverts per year for an evacuation. (Per day, it's 0.41 millisieverts, which is equivalent to four chest x-rays.) But Chen adds, ""one point [of data] doesn't mean that much.""The hot spot is similar to levels found in some areas affected by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in the former Soviet Union. Assuming the radiation is no more than 2 centimeters deep, Chen calculates that 163,000 Bq/kg is roughly equivalent to 8 million Bq/m2. The highest cesium-137 levels in some villages near Chernobyl were 5 million Bq/m2.  "

In an emergency, the limit can be raised to 100 millisieverts. For the current crisis it was upped to 250.For ordinary people its 1 mSv/annum.And it doesn't matter  what ""MY"" formula is . The point is that  limits are under constant revision and there are concerns about safe limit  and about attribution of radiation induced causes as cause of death when  the ""so called"" cause and effects are removed from each other in space and time. It would be open to question  from either side.Statistically significant divergences , shown by several studies ,could be easily questioned   by questioning the methodology or assumptions as Guru does. After all , it was also pointed out that  LSS study ( basis of IRCP) began in 1952 leaving out data worth of  7 years.But studies ( esp those from affected areas  russia and japan and dismissed by Western countries and dismissed by Nuk-Ind complex and scientists drawing  dal and roti from that ) does exist and ""cited"" in the paper  indicating higher morbidity and mortality attributed to radiation induced causes.

768,abhishek_sharma,27 Mar 2011 12:32 ,"What's the Current Radiation Threat to Japan's Food and Water?http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/03/whats-the-current-radiation-threat.htmlHealth concerns have been rising in Japan after the government found unacceptable radiation levels in milk and vegetables from several regions and in drinking water in Tokyo. The radiation comes from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. But how worrisome are the radiation levels? And when will the food and water supply be safe again?According to reports today, two tap water samples tested in Tokyo contained 190 and 210 becquerels/kilogram (Bq/kg) of iodine-131. That level is roughly twice the limit of 100 Bq/kg for infants that's considered safe by Japan's health officials.In response, Japanese authorities advised parents not to give babies tap water or use it in formula. Children are of special concern because any ingested iodine-131 will be absorbed by their developing thyroid gland and can lead to thyroid cancer. (The safe level is three times higher for adults.)Still, the risk to babies is low, says epidemiologist Richard Wakeford of the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. According to his calculations, an infant drinking tap water for a year that contained twice the safe level for iodine-131 would receive a dose of about 0.8 millisieverts. By comparison, the dose from natural background sources is 2.5 millisieverts a year, he says.Nuclear engineer Shih-Yew Chen of the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois says he's ""not at all surprised"" that iodine-131 is showing up in Tokyo's water because if the wind blows southward from the plant, it could carry radiation that far. Without knowing the source of Tokyo's drinking water, however, he says it's hard to say exactly how the iodine entered the water supply. But most likely it came from airborne dust or fell in rain or snow that fed lakes, streams, and reservoirs.The good news is that iodine-131 has a half-life of only 8 days, so any radiation from the Fukushima plant will be gone from the water within a couple of months once the leaks are stopped.Japan has also reportedly banned sales of raw milk and certain vegetables from Fukushima prefecture and some other prefectures after unsafe levels of iodine-131 and cesium-137 were detected in samples. (The United States has banned imports of dairy products and produce from several regions.) Milk likely became contaminated when cows fed in pastures dusted with fallout. Spinach, which had some of the highest detected radiation levels, has large leaves that collect more radioactive dust than nonleafy vegetables.As with tap water, safety levels are set based on the ingestion of large amounts of the food over a long time. ""Unless you consumed it continuously at a high level,"" the exposure level would be minimal, Chen says.The threat from iodine-131 in food will also fade quickly once the releases stop. But cesium-137 is a different story. Once the cesium enters the soil, its half-life of 30 years becomes a ""long-lasting problem for sure,"" Chen says, and it will show up in vegetables, meat, and milk.How much of a problem depends on the soil type, says retired Colorado State University radioecologist F. Ward Whicker. Clay binds the metal and keeps plants from taking it up. But if the soil is sandy and low in clay, cesium ""can be recycled from soil to plant to soil for a long, long time,"" Wicker says. Authorities dealt with the problem after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster by turning over a deep layer of soil to bury the radioactive dust.  "

771,chaanakya,27 Mar 2011 13:12 ,"Some good and some bad news16:00 JST March 27: Japanese authorities evacuated workers on Sunday from a reactor building they were working in after high doses of radiation were detected at a crippled nuclear power plant, the plant's operator said.Tokyo Electric Power Co said radiation 10 million times the usual level was detected in water that had accumulated at the No. 2 reactor's turbine housing unit.A Tokyo Electric official said workers left the No. 2 reactor's turbine housing unit to prevent exposure to radiation.They had been struggling to pump radioactive water out of the nuclear power station, battered by a huge earthquake and a tsunami just over two weeks ago, after it was found in buildings housing three of the six reactors.On Thursday, three workers were taken to hospital from reactor No. 3 after stepping in water with radiation levels 10,000 times higher than usually found in a reactor. But it was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable with Sunday's reading at reactor No. 2.However, it was yet another indication that the crisis at the plant was far from over, a point the world's chief nuclear inspector underlined at the weekend.Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), cautioned that Japan's nuclear emergency could go on for weeks, if not months more.""This is a very serious accident by all standards,"" he told the New York Times. ""And it is not yet over.""Radiation levels in the sea off the Fukushima Daiichi plant rose on Sunday to 1,850 times normal just over two weeks after the disaster struck, from 1,250 on Saturday, Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said.""Ocean currents will disperse radiation particles and so it will be very diluted by the time it gets consumed by fish and seaweed,"" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a senior agency official.OVERSHADOWEDThe crisis at the plant, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo, has overshadowed a relief and recovery effort from the magnitude 9.0 quake and the huge tsunami it triggered on March 11 that left more than 27,100 people dead or missing in northeast Japan.Amano, a former Japanese diplomat who made a trip to Japan after the quake, said authorities were still unsure about whether the plant's reactor cores and spent fuel were covered with the water needed to cool them.He told the newspaper he saw a few ""positive signs"" with the restoration of some electric power to the plant.But he said: ""More efforts should be done to put an end to the accident,"" while adding he was not criticizing Japan's response.The IAEA, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, said it had sent two additional teams to Japan over the past two days, one to help in monitoring radiation and one to assess food contamination.The Japanese government estimated last week the material damage from the March 11 catastrophe could top $300 billion, making it the world's costliest natural disaster.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said it was time to reassess the international atomic safety regime.Japan's nuclear crisis also looks set to claim its first, and unlikely, political casualty. In far away Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel's party faces a defeat in a key state on Sunday, largely because of her policy U-turns on nuclear power.NOT WORSENINGA Tokyo Electric official told a news conference on Saturday experts were still trying to figure out where to put the contaminated water they're trying to pump out of the reactors.Two of the plant's reactors are now seen as safe but the other four are volatile, occasionally emitting steam and smoke.The government has said the situation is nowhere near to being resolved, although it was not deteriorating.""We are preventing the situation from worsening -- we've restored power and pumped in fresh water -- and making basic steps toward improvement but there is still no room for complacency,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told a news conference on Saturday.<snip>no significant quantities of radiological material had been deposited in the area around the plant since March 19, according to tests on Friday.In Tokyo, a metropolis of 13 million, a Reuters reading on Sunday morning showed ambient radiation of 0.22 microsieverts per hour, about six times normal for the city. That was well within the global average of naturally occurring background radiation of 0.17-0.39 microsieverts per hour, a range given by the World Nuclear Association."

Here is Wiki on dosage from various sources:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_radiationThe worldwide average background dose for a human being is about 2.4 millisievert (mSv) per year.[3] This exposure is mostly from cosmic radiation and natural radionuclides in the environment (including those within the body). This is far greater than human-caused background radiation exposure, which in the year 2000 amounted to an average of about 5 μSv per year from historical nuclear weapons testing, nuclear power accidents and nuclear industry operation combined,[4] and is greater than the average exposure from medical tests, which ranges from 0.04 to 1 mSv per year. Older coal-fired power plants without effective fly ash capture are one of the largest sources of human-caused background radiation exposure."

795,SureshP,28 Mar 2011 02:42 ,"Perhaps this might help ??What's behind our conflicted feelings on nukes?March 24, 2011 By SETH BORENSTEIN , AP Science WriterEven before the Japanese nuclear crisis, Americans were bombarded with contradictory images and messages that frighten even when they try to reassure. It started with the awesome and deadly mushroom cloud rising from the atomic bomb, which led to fallout shelters and school duck-and-cover drills.On screen, Bert, the ever-alert turtle of the government civil-defense cartoons, told us all we needed to do was shield our eyes when the bomb exploded and duck under our desks. Jane Fonda in ""The China Syndrome"" told us to be worried about nuclear power accidents, and just days later, Three Mile Island seemed to prove her right. Now bumbling nuclear plant worker Homer Simpson, Blinky, the radiation-mutated, three-eyed fish, and evil nuclear power plant owner Montgomery Burns make us giggle and wince.The experts tell us to be logical and not to worry, that nuclear power is safer than most technologies we readily accept. Producing and burning coal, oil and gas kill far more people through accidents and pollution each year.But our perception of nuclear issues isn't about logic. It's about dread, magnified by arrogance in the nuclear industry, experts in risk and nuclear energy say.""Whereas science is about analysis, risk resides in most of us as a gut feeling,"" said University of Oregon psychology professor and risk expert Paul Slovic. ""Radiation really creates very strong feelings of fear - not really fear, I would say more anxiety and unease.""Some experts contend that when a disaster has potentially profound repercussions, we should pay attention to emotions as much as logic.Nuclear energy hits all our hot buttons when we judge how risky something is: It's invisible. It's out of our control. It's manmade, high-tech and hard to understand. It's imposed on us, instead of something we choose. It's associated with major catastrophes, not small problems. And if something goes wrong, it can cause cancer - an illness we fear far more than a bigger killer like heart disease. Thirty years ago, before the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Slovic took four groups of people and asked them to rate 30 risks. Two groups - the League of Women Voters and college students - put nuclear power as the biggest risk, ahead of things that are deadlier, such as cars, handguns and cigarettes. Business club members ranked nuclear power as the eighth risk out of 30. Risk experts put it at 20.The only fear that Slovic has seen as comparable in his studies to nuclear power is terrorism.A Pew Research Center poll after the Japanese nuclear crisis found support for increased nuclear power melting down. Last October the American public was evenly split over an expansion of nuclear power; now it's 39 percent in favor and 52 percent opposed.""Nuclear radiation carries a very powerful stigma. It has automatic negative associations: cancer, bombs, catastrophes,"" said David Ropeik who teaches risk communications at Harvard University. You can't separate personal feelings from the discussion of actual risks, said Ropeik, author of the book ""How Risky Is it, Really?""But Ropeik, who has consulted for the nuclear industry, said those fears aren't nearly as justified as other public health concerns. He worries that the public will turn to other choices, such as fossil fuels, which are linked to more death and climate change than the nuclear industry is. He cites one government study that says 24,000 Americans die each year from air pollution and another that says fossil fuel power plants are responsible for about one-seventh of that.At the same time, health researchers have not tied any U.S. deaths to 1979's Three Mile Island accident. United Nations agencies put the death toll from Chernobyl at 4,000 to 9,000, with anti-nuclear groups contending the number is much higher.Since 2000, more than 1,300 American workers have died in coal, oil and natural gas industry accidents, according to federal records. Radiological accidents have killed no one at U.S. nuclear plants during that time, and nuclear power has one of the lowest industrial accident rates in the country, said Nuclear Energy Institute spokesman Steve Kerekes.Alan Kolaczkowski, a retired nuclear engineer, consulted with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on specific probabilities of accidents at nuclear plants. He estimates the risk of a disaster at a given plant at 1 in 100,000 - about the same as your chance of being killed by lightning over your lifetime. For comparison, an American's odds of dying in a car crash are 1 in 88; being shot to death, 1 in 306; and dying from bee stings, 1 in 71,623, according to the National Safety Council. The council couldn't come up with the odds of dying from radiation because it lists zero people dying in the United States from radiation in 2007, the most recent year for which these cause-of-death figures are available.Ropeik calls this mismatch between statistics and feelings ""a classic example of how public policy gets made - not about the numbers alone, but how we feel about them, and it ends up doing us more harm.""Kolaczkowski faulted his own industry.""Those in the industry believe it is so complex it cannot be explained to the general public, so as a result, the industry has a trust-me attitude and that only goes so far,"" he said. ""We're all afraid of the unknown, the ghosts under the bed.""David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that presses for safer nuclear plants, is a former plant engineer. He likens the public's fears to unjustified worries about shark attacks: The risks and deaths are small, but the attention and fears are big.""It may be an irrational fear, but I don't think it's one that can be educated away,"" Lochbaum said.However, calling these fears irrational isn't justified, said Georgetown University law professor and former Environmental Protection Agency associate administrator Lisa Heinzerling. She said people's concerns have been unjustly trivialized.People have been trained to think about and prepare for low-probability, catastrophic events like the earthquake and tsunami that caused the Japanese nuclear disaster, Heinzerling said. She pointed to homeowner's insurance. Most people won't have a fire that destroys their home, but ""we worry about really big things even if they are improbable because we will be wiped out.""Americans also have long had an ambivalence toward new technology, going back to worries about the introduction of electric lights in homes 130 years ago, said University of Detroit Mercy history professor John Staudenmaier,""Americans overreact with adulation and awe, then overreact with fear and anxiety,"" said Staudenmaier, editor emeritus of the academic journal Technology and Culture.Trying to explain the fears, nuclear industry spokesman Kerekes said, ""There's a perception gap that exists."" But he adds: ""Other industries haven't had to do deal with an animated cartoon series that lasted, what, 25 years?""That would be ""The Simpsons."" Producer Al Jean said the show, which has been on the air since 1989, reflects America's real feelings.""There is something that taps into people's view of big business, and in particular, nuclear power, which is giving profit-minded people complete control over life and death. It is a scary thought, and I think that is a topic for satire,"" Jean said.Jean recognizes that nuclear plant workers aren't really like Homer Simpson and radiation doesn't ""put a cute third eye on a fish."" But he thinks his show is accurate with its portrayal of the greedy, conniving nuclear power plant owner Montgomery Burns: ""Mr. Burns may be representative of some people in the nuclear industry - not just nuclear, but all industries - who seem like they're more interested in getting the money rather than doing what's safe. I think that's what resonates in the public.""Yet, Jean takes pride in noting that the Springfield nuclear power plant has never blown up.The lack of transparency in the nuclear industry- including Tokyo Electric Power Co. - has caused some of the problems, said Baruch Fischhoff, a professor of decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. It is a charge Kerekes disputes.""The nuclear industry has behaved in a way that is untrustworthy, both in the sense of not telling people the truth and not having the competence to manage their own affairs,"" Fischhoff said. He added that industry is too quick to brush off people's fears: ""Telling the public that they are idiots is certainly not a way of making friends.""http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-03-conflicted-nukes.html"

803,Amber G.,28 Mar 2011 07:39 ,"Interesting  contrast between  Fukushima  Chernobyl.. worth reading in full.. (only some excerpts posted below)IPhone Apps Versus Soviet SubterfugeTamara Kruglikova waited days for Soviet officials to announce the Chernobyl nuclear disaster about 140 kilometers (87 miles) from her home. Hiroshi Ishikawa posts radiation levels every 30 seconds online to supplement Japanese government reports on the fallout from Fukushima.On April 26, 1986, as Chernobyl’s ruptured reactor spewed radiation into the air, children in Kruglikova’s city of Gomel played outdoors and adults prepared for May 1 rallies. The one curiosity was why the mud turned an orange-yellow color after it drizzled, she said in a telephone interview from Gomel.<snip>The United Nation’s International Atomic Energy Agency measured the disaster at 5 out of 7. Chernobyl was the only accident to be ranked a 7 as 1,200 tons of graphite and radioactive matter were ejected into the air, polluting land and increasing cancer rates, according to the World Nuclear Association.Unlike their Soviet counterparts, Japanese residents have followed the drama via non-stop media coverage including briefings by the government, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. and nuclear agency. Officials are pushed to publish everything from the status of each reactor to the level of radiation found in local spinach.The words “millisievert” and “Becquerel” -- measurements of radiation -- have entered the daily vernacular, and the anonymous 50 nuclear workers who initially tackled the disaster became a blog phenomenon.Kruglikova said she heard news of an accident at Chernobyl by word of mouth and from reports on Radio Liberty, a U.S. station set up to broadcast into communist countries. Even after the Soviet government acknowledged the accident, the propaganda machine downplayed the radiation impact, she said.TKruglikova’s school had no Geiger counters and little idea what effects radiation could have. Speculation that iodine might be an antidote resulted in several poisonings as people mixed it with milk without caring for the dose, she said.More than 60 Japanese sites post radiation levels from around the country, while private companies have set up their own monitoring to keep employees and the public updated. ..“Yurekuru Call for iPhone,” an early warning earthquake notification service, “Flashlight-4,” which uses the screen as a light source, and a location app for the nearest hospitals and convenience stores, were among the top downloads, it said.“It increases the amount of noise, false, ungrounded and manipulative information that may cause panic.”"
804,Amber G.,28 Mar 2011 09:08 ,"Wall Street Journal Article: About Media Overreaction...Nuclear OverreactionsAfter a once-in-300-years earthquake, the Japanese have been keeping cool amid the chaos, organizing an enormous relief and rescue operation, and generally earning the world's admiration. We wish we could say the same for the reaction in the U.S., where the troubles at Japan's nuclear reactors have produced an overreaction about the risks of modern life and technology.Part of the problem is the lack of media proportion about the disaster itself. The quake and tsunami have killed hundreds, and probably thousands, with tens of billions of dollars in damage. ....Yet the bulk of U.S. media coverage has focused on a nuclear accident whose damage has so far been limited and contained to the plant sites. In simple human terms, the natural destruction of Earth and sea have far surpassed any errors committed by man. Given the incomplete news reports, it is impossible to say how much worse the nuclear damage will be. Unlike the Soviets at Chernobyl, the Japanese have been taking sensible precautions like evacuating people near the plants and handing out iodine pills even if they may never be needed. These precautions increase public worry, but better to take them even if they prove to be unnecessary.<snip>But more than other energy sources, nuclear plants have had their costs increased by artificial political obstacles and delay. The U.S. hasn't built a new nuclear plant since 1979, ....TOur larger point is less about nuclear power than how we react as a society to inevitable disasters, both natural and man-made. Because a plane crashes, we don't stop flying. Because an oil rig explodes in the Gulf, we don't (or at least we shouldn't) stop drilling for oil. And because the Challenger space shuttle blew up, we didn't stop shuttle flights—though we do seem to have lost much of our national will for further manned space exploration. We should learn from the Japanese nuclear crisis, not let it feed a political panic over nuclear power in general.***The paradox of material and technological progress is that we seem to become more risk-averse the safer it makes us. The more comfortable we become, the less eager we are to take the risks that are the only route to future progress. The irony is that one reason Japan has survived this catastrophic event as well as it has is its great material development and wealth.Modern civilization is in the daily business of measuring and mitigating risk, but its advance requires that we continue to take risk. It would compound Japan's tragedy if the lesson America learns is that we should pursue the illusory and counterproductive goal of eliminating all risk."

It was, to repeat it, why  the same scientists  who  recommend  the 20K evacuation (and monitor radiation doses, iodine etc) also tells us why media hysteria is bad. A poster may miss the whole point but  I was asking,  why, looking at the same data,  the same scientists,  support  a) close monitoring of radiation, and avoiding it (even low dose)  and b) support the data of low risk due to low radiation. The answer to this is not trivial.Experts are likely to miss the point as they are more concerned with educating how radioactivity is good or not. When everyone concerned directly  with likely fallout, unlike the experts who may be more interested in technicalities,  it would become their collective concern.That is why before clearing any project EIA and local consultations are provided for. Lobbies may try hard to skirt these processes but ""Neta""  would be the last person to take that risk on the  FWIW.And when you ask the question from other about the same scientists, you should also not use the same word as seen here. Are they neo converts to the religion or newly discovered some facts to change their views when regulatory bodies constantly revise the upper limit based on the studies by ""same"" scientists?When life and its quality is of concern these issues are not trivial and  I can see the hand wringing by nuk lobby.In case you missed it completelyI quoted report earlierThis month, Finland's Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor was supposed to begin generating power, a tangible sign of the revival of the nuclear industry outside of Asia after nearly 30 years of no new construction because of accidents, cost-overruns and other issues. Instead, the reactor won't be completed for more than three more years, its price is nearly 60 percent more than anticipated, and it is mired in costly legal squabbles between the builder, Areva, and the Finnish utility, Pohjolan Voima.In the U.S., since 2003, 17 applications for 26 new reactors have been filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but not one is yet under construction.Despite dozens of new nuclear plants ordered or built in Asia in recent years, ""increased deployment of nuclear power has been slow both in the United States and globally,"" wrote the authors of a new Massachusetts Institute of Technology review of the state of nuclear power.Those figures, say the authors of the report, an update on a similar report in 2003, mean that ""even if all the announced plans for new nuclear power plant construction are realized, the total will be well behind that needed for reaching a thousand gigawatts of new capacity worldwide by 2050.""One thousand gigawatts is the number the M.I.T. professors estimated would be needed to ensure that nuclear power provided 20 percent of global electricity needs as well as cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants. In the U.S., the number would be jumping from 100 to 300 gigawatts of nuclear-sourced electricity by 2050.After all, once operating, nuclear power plants burn nothing and therefore emit no carbon dioxide as fossil fuel–burning power plants do. (There are, of course, significant greenhouse gas emissions associated with building and fueling nuclear facilities).But the price of new nuclear power has ""escalated dramatically,"" according to the report, jumping by 15 percent a year to reach as much as $4,000 per kilowatt compared with $2,300 for coal-fired generation and just $850 for natural gas. And the industry is asking for at least $100 billion in federal tax subsidies and loan guarantees for the 26 reactors currently planned.The situation is no better in Europe, according to Steven Thomas, a professor of energy studies at the University of Greenwich in London: Finland cannot complete its new reactor; the U.K. has yet to get started on any projects; and a new nuclear reactor in France, after 18 months of construction, is 20 percent overbudget and requires complete subsidy by the French government.""The nuclear power industry in Europe is in the midst of the same kind of regulatory and financial uncertainty that makes the future of the industry murky at best in this country,"" Thomas said during a conference call with reporters. ""We've been waiting for the renaissance for 10 years.""Nor has there been a solution to the issue of nuclear waste. In the U.S., the plan to use Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert as a repository for spent nuclear fuel rods is in limbo, opposed by the Obama administration. Reprocessing nuclear fuel, currently underway only in France, has proved prohibitively expensive, and it raises concerns about the proliferation of plutonium for nuclear weapons.oday, there are about 44 plants under construction around the world in 12 countries, principally China, India, Korea, and Russia. There are no new plants under construction in the United States.This was the current state of Nuclear industry and its revival was seen in KRIC countries. That is how netas would decide after fukushima.And one last point, when you quote random equation in an effort to digress the point  (Internal energy vs heat capacity)  or boltzmann equation (which he clearly not mentioned but linked)   that is acceptable and when I give a equation it becomes silly.I am yet to see that is is wrong.The way I see it is that there is a tendency to divert the attention away from the real issues. Interestingly, caveats are applicable to you only and not to others who are required to give you precise answers. I read in one report when it was pointed out that there is increased incidence on cancer etc that it would be result  of better reporting rather than radiation (as radiation is supposedly good.) Talk of circular logic.Anyway I request you to ignore my posts and let moderators decide if I should post any thing about tsunami quake and radiations."

Tsunami height will vary from location to location, depending on local bathymetry and coastal features. Besides, all this can be done only with good model runs for various types of water column dislocations due to an earthquake. It is a relatively new applied science and very likely such numbers have got better and with good predictability only in recent years.You can get a pretty good approximation with a paper and pencil and applying standard models . There is nothing special about Tsunami waves per se. They are the standard gravity waves (just like the ones generated in the oceans in general due to wind action). Water gets piled up and acts under the influence of gravity.The standard model like Orbital wave theory (pls note how after I posted the theory and madrassa math behind this, all and sundry including those who come up with brilliances like 1.25 cups = 1 bucket and have the gumption and chutzpah to call others ""ill-informed"" will now become ""egg spurts"" on this, even if they can make next to nothing of it) explains the dynamics pretty well.All you need to keep in mind is that Tsunami waves are very low frequency, ultra large wavelength (upto say 200 KM) waves. The point is, with that kind of wavelength , they travel thousands of kilometers in the space of  a few oscillations with little attenuation (low freq) , nearly the speed of a jet plane (the good news is Chennai-Singapore is 3.5 hrs, so you do get atleast 3 hrs warning after the event at say Java /Sumatra ).So now, when such a wave approaches a shallow shelf like typically found in India, just like a open ocean wave when it approaches shore starts cresting (ie height/wave length beyond a point where the wave itself is stable), the tsunami wave too starts cresting and rises in height and slams as an extra large wave!  There is really no difference between a 3 m Tsunami wave vs a 3m Tyhoon wave in terms of effects, the difference being that you dont have warning in a Tsunami wave while there are several hours of warning (sky darkening, rails,squalls etc in a Typhoon) and that is what creates more damage in life and property. For a particular feature like a cove etc, that can be added on to the model and a pretty good approxmition /first cut got. For final confirmation, they would build a sub scale model of the location with all the features, put it in a wave basin and you can get the heights and effects in every scenario pretty accurately to confirm the first cut estimates.All this stuff is something which you do in Madrassas since atleast the 80s on a routine basis. Okay , since this is BRF after all, lets have a quick jingo quiz.Now given that there is a Category 5 hurricane in the Arabian sea some 500 kms off the coast of Karachi, you have the carriers  VikAd and Vikrant (the new ADS ) fighting through gales with 30m waves and INS Arihant and other 2 subs of their class running underwater at 100m depth, in relation to the carriers on the surface, what percentage in terms of max roll and other motions , heave , pitch etc, will the subs experience ?Folks with deep background in fluid mech from (Aero, Naval Arch, Engg Mech, Engg Fyzzics,Mech, Civil/Evil etc) pliss to excuse. Now that the fundamental theory has been posted, it should be easy enough for mango people to get it."

831,chaanakya,28 Mar 2011 16:01 ,"^^The situation will get attention from concerned people and as you said it would get worse before it gets better.Here is something more to think about .More radioactive substances found in seawaterMore high levels of radioactive material have been found in seawater near the troubled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Tokyo Electric Power Company says samples collected 30 meters from one of the plant's water outlets on Sunday contained 46 becquerels per cubic centimeter of iodine-131. That's 1,150 times higher than the regulated standard level.On Friday and Saturday, water samples collected 330 meters south of another outlet showed levels of iodine-131 that were higher than 1,000 times the standard level. However, on Sunday the levels had dropped to 250 times the standard level.The government's nuclear safety agency says radioactive materials may have leaked from the plant and drifted with the current from south to north.TEPCO is struggling to remove highly radioactive water from the turbine buildings of 3 reactors before work to restore their cooling systems can begin.On Tuesday, the company intends to pump fresh water, instead of sea water, into spent fuel storage pools of 2 reactors.Fresh water was pumped into the reactors by Saturday, to prevent the salt water from corroding the cooling system.Radioactive levels in the air are decreasing at most observation points in the surrounding areas on Monday.The reading in Fukushima City, 65 kilometers northwest of the nuclear power plant, was 3.84 microsieverts per hour at 1 AM.The annual total limit of radiation exposure considered safe for humans is 1,000 microsieverts based on standards set by the International Commission http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201103280144.htmlAnd anotherTokyo Electric Power Co. acknowledged for the first time possible damage to core pressure containers at the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant--the last line of defense in preventing radioactive materials from spewing out.TEPCO officials told reporters Monday morning that despite the continuous pumping in of water to cool down the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 reactor cores, water levels were not rising as expected, meaning the pressure containers may not be completely sealed off.The water, which is believed to be mixing with radioactive materials from the fuel rods within, is likely leaking from the pressure containers, they said.The tsunami that hit the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant after the March 11 Great East Japan Earthquake knocked out the emergency generators at the three reactors. The systems that circulate water within the pressure containers to cool the fuel rods also stopped working.Workers have been pumping in water through pipes to the pressure container to submerge the fuel rods and directly cool the decay heat that continues to be emitted even after the reactors were stopped.But the water level meters for the three reactors have not risen as expected.TEPCO officials said a possible reason the water levels were not rising sufficiently were breaches in the lower part of the pressure containers. They said they did not know what caused the possible damage. ( looks like breach and damage is being used without much clarity)A pressure container holds nuclear fuel pellets placed in metal rods that have been bundled together. A containment vessel, located within the building housing the reactor, surrounds the pressure container.The pressure containers at the Fukushima plant are made of steel 16 centimeters thick. The lower part of the containers have openings for measuring and other equipment. Water may be leaking from around those parts, the officials said.TEPCO has cited the possibility that fuel rods may have been damaged due to overheating after being exposed above the water's surface in the core.Here is the height of tsunamiThe March 11th tsunami that hit Japan's northeastern coast was as high as 13 meters in the city of Rikuzentakata, Iwate Prefecture.Researchers from the University of Tokyo and the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology said on Sunday that the tsunami reached a gymnasium one kilometer from the shoreline and climbed as high as 13 meters.Safe annual radiation absorbed  limit in mSv is 1000 mSv  as repeatedly dinned to brf membersAt Fukushima 65 km away from  afflicted NPP was 3.84 mSv per hourSo a person not voluntarily evacuating outside the 30 km evacuation zone would be receiving , lets see3.84 * 24 hrs =92.6 mSv per daysince 16 days into crisishe would have received 92.6mSv * 16 days=1474.56 mSvIf caesium 137 ityadi ityadi are found to have its way thenhypothetically he would be getting92.6 mSv * 365 days=33638 mSv /annum.So actually a dose of 3.84 mSv per hour translate into 33638 mSv per annum( subject to rise or fall in radiation level.) FWIWMadarssa maths only.Could be wrong. Some catch has to be there .In case I am egg plastered http://hps.org/publicinformation/radter ... act49.htmlCumulative doseThe total dose resulting from repeated exposures of ionizing radiation to the same portion of the body, or to the whole body, over a period of time.But I only remember those leh boys in wangdoo's school who were more concerned with the fun part as opposed to the concerns of chatur about ampere part which he could have worked out himself  if not in pain.

Same type for calculation may keep you in the right ball park while consuming tainted food.

There is really no difference between a 3 m Tsunami wave vs a 3m Tyhoon wave in terms of effects, the difference being that you dont have warning in a Tsunami wave while there are several hours of warning (sky darkening, rails,squalls etc in a Typhoon) and that is what creates more damage in life and property. Vina, This is not necessarily completely accurate. The peak of a Cyclone surge is fairly localized. Also it is a pressure induced surge, not a proper traveling wave. Meaning it is the local water that rises up and drowns people. In New-Orleans for instance it was the river, marsh and lake ponchatrain that rose up. Yes there is a ocean component but once the 'eye' reaches land it runs out of water to be maximally destructive and only the sea shore sees a surge. Also a Cyclone looses energy as it hits land and one half of it is parked over land when the surge hits in any case.A Tsunami actually keeps coming. Usually 3-4 times. The full energy is concentrated when it hits land.Also WRT to Tsunami's the wave height is often wildly variable even at the same place due to the characteristics of the wave propagation and direction of energy travel of each earthquake. You can have a 10 m wave historically and then if your luck runs out a 30 meter one can hit the same spot. Historical/Scientific data shows that the exact same Indonesian earthquake and Tsunami struck 200 years ago but there was no Tsunami or a relatively minor one in India. Also in the late 18th century a 8.0 plus quake in the Andaman's generated a 1 meter Tsunami on the East coast. no lives were lost. In the 1940's a 7.5 quake in the same area generated a monster Tsunami on our east coast that killed thousands."

But the essential point is that when  a 3m wave hits, it doesn't matter whether it was from a Tsunami or a Cyclone. A 3m wave IS a 3 m wave. The peak of a Cyclone surge is fairly localized. Also it is a pressure induced surge, not a proper traveling wave. Meaning it is the local water that rises up and drowns people.I am not sure what you mean. When a Tsunami does travel thousands of KM, it is the wave that gets propagated with a certain phase and group velocity. What it does mean though is that the water that hit Madras beach was the water that was lying offshore just a few mins ago and did not travel all the way from Banda Aceh to Chennai to hit the beach. Yes there is a ocean component but once the 'eye' reaches land it runs out of water to be maximally destructive and only the sea shore sees a surge. Well, a tsunami wave once it hits land dissipates as well, because there is no more ""sea"" to propagate!A Tsunami actually keeps coming. Usually 3-4 times. The full energy is concentrated when it hits land.Yes, the earth quake and the water wall gives rise to multiple shocks, some (not of all ) might generate tsunamis, out of which one will a particular biggie and the rest some chut-mut stuff. Also, the energy does dissipate with distance and number of oscillations  due to the ""real"" nature of water with viscocity,vorticies etc etc.In some ways Typhoons/Cyclones can pick up intensity with distance, especially if they pick energy from the warm water over which they travel. A cyclone travelling 3000 km over warm water will pack a wallop when it hits. A tsumani wave on the other hand will be attenuated in energy when compared to the energy that generated the wave. Also WRT to Tsunami's the wave height is often wildly variable even at the same place due to the characteristics of the wave propagation and direction of energy travel of each earthquake.That will be true for a cyclone generated wave as well, depending on if you get a direct hit or a glancing blow based on how the cyclone was traveling. In India, lets face it, a good estimate of a cyclone surge will in all probability will cover for a tsunami in most cases as well, given that we have pretty strong cyclones with big surges in India and that unless something off the chart like a Richter 12 (remember it is a logarithmic scale) happens off Baluchistan/ Java/Sumatra."
860,negi,28 Mar 2011 21:23 ,Well TF saar is right i.e. 10 mtr waves generated by a Storm/Hurricane are a lot different from a wave of similar wave height as generated by a Tsunami; firstly imho wave height  does not give the complete picture of the energy content of a wave the most important attribute is the 'wave length' the latter measures anywhere around several hundred Kms for a Tsunami where as a wave generated by the storm might span only for several hundred meters. It's the wave length that governs the speed with which the wave travels (they are directly proportional) so in case of a Tsunami a wave might travel as fast as 500 or even 1000+ kph as against a typical storm generated wave which might travel at most at 100 kph (that's why early warning systems are not as effective against Tsunamis as against a Hurricane).

It is a Cyclone surge or most commonly storm surge. The water is mostly raised in place. It does not flow from Ocean to shore as in a Tsunami. If you see the video the destructive power of the flowing Tsunami is obvious. The towns were scoured clean. Compare that to New Orleans where the houses mostly remained standing under water even on the sea shore. Scour was minimal and most damage was by surface waves.Also what about the scale issue. As you have noted the maximum of a Tsunami is essentially unlimited when you consider large objects falling into the ocean. Storm surges are limited by wind speed and atmospheric pressure to about 3-6m max."

Perhaps large scale salt-storage solar plants are safe in a sense, and wind-farms out in the sea [but then subject to underwater quakes or tsunamis too but that will be a financial loss and not that damaging to human life]. But then we need backups to be used in case of war -when the solar plant I mentioned will be quite vulnerable because it will be spread around over a large area, or the off-shore wind-farms which will be vulnerable to tsunamis, and big dams are of course even more of a danger because they can be used to also flood populations.

But however as a No-Nothing, I am convinced I am right and I will keep repeating the same things endlessly and repeatedly, despite how many ever times I have put my foot in my own mouth and contradicted what was written in the article I linked to myself and drew OPPOSITE conclusions.Now, let us examine that article in detail. Let me post it in full.AP IMPACT: Nuclear plant downplayed tsunami riskBy YURI KAGEYAMA and JUSTIN PRITCHARD, Associated Press Sun Mar 27, 4:47 pm ETTOKYO – In planning their defense against a killer tsunami, the people running Japan's now-hobbled nuclear power plant dismissed important scientific evidence and all but disregarded 3,000 years of geological history, an Associated Press investigation shows.Ok. So there is a postulate that the plant folks ignored 3000 years of geological history.The misplaced confidence displayed by Tokyo Electric Power Co. was prompted by a series of overly optimistic assumptions that concluded the Earth couldn't possibly release the level of fury it did two weeks ago, pushing the six-reactor Fukushima Dai-ichi complex to the brink of multiple meltdowns.Hmm. So, the Tsunami was way above what their estimates were.  Definitely. Instead of the reactors staying dry, as contemplated under the power company's worst-case scenario, the plant was overrun by a torrent of water much higher and stronger than the utility argued could occur, according to an AP analysis of records, documents and statements from researchers, the utility and the Japan's national nuclear safety agency.And while TEPCO and government officials have said no one could have anticipated such a massive tsunami, there is ample evidence that such waves have struck the northeast coast of Japan before — and that it could happen again along the culprit fault line, which runs roughly north to south, offshore, about 220 miles (350 kilometers) east of the plant.Ah, and all this while we have been talking about how Tsunami impacts depend on local bathymetry and coastal features for multiple pages (I posted on it,so did Bade Mian)TEPCO officials say they had a good system for projecting tsunamis. They declined to provide more detailed explanations, saying they were focused on the ongoing nuclear crisis.What is clear: TEPCO officials discounted important readings from a network of GPS units that showed that the two tectonic plates that create the fault were strongly ""coupled,"" or stuck together, thus storing up extra stress along a line hundreds of miles long. The greater the distance and stickiness of such coupling, experts say, the higher the stress buildup — pressure that can be violently released in an earthquake.That evidence, published in scientific journals starting a decade ago, represented the kind of telltale characteristics of a fault being able to produce the truly overwhelming quake — and therefore tsunami — that it did.On top of that, TEPCO modeled the worst-case tsunami using its own computer program instead of an internationally accepted prediction method.Oh. How horrible indeed. But how did the AP folks know that the ""internationally accepted prediction method"" is soup-e-rear or inferior to Tepco's proprietary method ?  So unless some 3rd party panel of experts review both and decide on the merits or demerits of either, this is toilet paper journalism of insinuations variety. But let that slide. It matters how Japanese calculate risk. In short, they rely heavily on what has happened to figure out what might happen, even if the probability is extremely low. If the view of what has happened isn't accurate, the risk assessment can be faulty.That approach led to TEPCO's disregard of much of Japan's tsunami history.Ah, that is called the determinate method innit ? Cut to the person who vehemently concluded in a wink of an eye and a google search that there are ""No plate movements"" and problems in India's west coast and wanted to look up histories of Tsunami events and decide as  "" No risk to the west coast"" . Err, they did exactly what he wanted to do. Now you cant blame them for taking your advice can you. How horrible!In postulating the maximum-sized earthquake and tsunami that the Fukushima Dai-ichi complex might face, TEPCO's engineers decided not to factor in quakes earlier than 1896. That meant the experts excluded a major quake that occurred more than 1,000 years ago — a tremor followed by a powerful tsunami that hit many of the same locations as the recent disaster.A TEPCO reassessment presented only four months ago concluded that tsunami-driven water would push no higher than 18 feet (5.7 meters) once it hit the shore at the Fukushima Dai-ichi complex. The reactors sit up a small bluff, between 14 and 23 feet (4.3 and 6.3 meters) above TEPCO's projected high-water mark, according to a presentation at a November seismic safety conference in Japan by TEPCO civil engineer Makoto Takao.""We assessed and confirmed the safety of the nuclear plants,"" Takao asserted.However, the wall of water that thundered ashore two weeks ago reached about 27 feet (8.2 meters) above TEPCO's prediction. The flooding disabled backup power generators, located in basements or on first floors, imperiling the nuclear reactors and their nearby spent fuel pools.EEks.. We have people claiming 38 meter Tsunamis at Fukushima and then we hav 8.2m as published and called AmberG as ""ill informed"" . ___The story leading up to the Tsunami of 2011 goes back many, many years — several millennia, in fact.The Jogan tsunami of 869 displayed striking similarities to the events in and around the Fukushima Dai-ichi reactors. The importance of that disaster, experts told the AP, is that the most accurate planning for worst-case scenarios is to study the largest events over the longest period of time. In other words, use the most data possible.The evidence shows that plant operators should have known of the dangers — or, if they did know, disregarded them.As early as 2001, a group of scientists published a paper documenting the Jogan tsunami. They estimated waves of nearly 26 feet (8 meters) at Soma, about 25 miles north of the plant. North of there, they concluded that a surge from the sea swept sand more than 2 1/2 miles (4 kilometers) inland across the Sendai plain. The latest tsunami pushed water at least about 1 1/2 miles (2 kilometers) inland.Err, so the greatest and biggest Tsunami they could find going back millenia resulted in a surge of 8 meters only . And we were told of thundering 38m Tsunamis (and a direct challenge to my assertion that such things probably NEVER happened becuase they are indeed extremely large). I am still waiting to hear which Tsunami produced a 38m surge at Fukushima!The scientists also found two additional layers of sand and concluded that two additional ""gigantic tsunamis"" had hit the region during the past 3,000 years, both presumably comparable to Jogan. Carbon dating couldn't pinpoint exactly when the other two hit, but the study's authors put the range of those layers of sand at between 140 B.C. and A.D. 150, and between 670 B.C. and 910 B.C.In a 2007 paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Pure and Applied Geophysics, two TEPCO employees and three outside researchers explained their approach to assessing the tsunami threat to Japan's nuclear reactors, all 54 of which sit near the sea or ocean.To ensure the safety of Japan's coastal power plants, they recommended that facilities be designed to withstand the highest tsunami ""at the site among all historical and possible future tsunamis that can be estimated,"" based on local seismic characteristics.Ah. See, now they are talking sense. Please focus on the word LOCAL seismic characterestics and ESTIMATED laddies. Now isn't that a contradiction in terms, you still ESTIMATE and cannot design for a 100% coverage of risk! HOW DO YOU KNOW YOUR ESTIMATE IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE NEXT EVENT ? Fundamental question. But the authors went on to write that tsunami records before 1896 could be less reliable because of ""misreading, misrecording and the low technology available for the measurement itself."" The TEPCO employees and their colleagues concluded, ""Records that appear unreliable should be excluded.""Two years later, in 2009, another set of researchers concluded that the Jogan tsunami had reached 1 mile (1.5 kilometers) inland at Namie, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) north of the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant.The warning from the 2001 report about the 3,000-year history would prove to be most telling: ""The recurrence interval for a large-scale tsunami is 800 to 1,100 years. More than 1,100 years have passed since the Jogan tsunami, and, given the reoccurrence interval, the possibility of a large tsunami striking the Sendai plain is high.""Now this bolded part is EXACTLY what I tried explaining by offering the ""India Tsunami Protection Option"" .  If you go back and read the hint in that post, you will notice that I had written that GIVEN that a Tsunami occured recently in India, the CONDITIONAL probability of another big Tsunami happening is very rare indeed , given the overall low probability of a large Tsunami happening and I put my money behind it .So what should be the thing to do based on that ?  In the next 40 or 60 years which is the life of a Nuke plant, if you set one up today, the chances of it encountering a large Tsunami in India is SO MINISCULE, you could IGNORE it. . Sure you will build the protection and design and everything based on a better max damage estimate etc, but in all probability, it will NEVER get tested in the life of the plant .  That was an important point I tried telling and getting people to think . But hey, it gets classified as an ""Insurance Scam"" and ""Monkey Business"". Well, what can I say. All ""PissNess"" whether monkey or otherwise is deadly serious indeed. All in all, separates smart from not so smart ones. Milk of milk and water of water onree.   ___The fault involved in the Fukushima Dai-ichi tsunami is part of what is known as a subduction zone. In subduction zones, one tectonic plate dives under another. When the fault ruptures, the sea floor snaps upward, pushing up the water above it and potentially creating a tsunami. Subduction zones are common around Japan and throughout the Pacific Ocean region.TEPCO's latest calculations were started after a magnitude-8.8 subduction zone earthquake off the coast of Chile in February 2010.In such zones over the past 50 years, earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater have occurred in Alaska, Chile and Indonesia. All produced large tsunamis.When two plates are locked across a large area of a subduction zone, the potential for a giant earthquake increases. And those are the exact characteristics of where the most recent quake occurred.TEPCO ""absolutely should have known better,"" said Dr. Costas Synolakis, a leading American expert on tsunami modeling and an engineering professor at the University of Southern California. ""Common sense,"" he said, should have produced a larger predicted maximum water level at the plant.TEPCO's tsunami modelers did not judge that, in a worst-case scenario, the strong subduction and coupling conditions present off the coast of Fukushima Dai-ichi could produce the 9.0-magnitude earthquake that occurred. Instead, it figured the maximum at 8.6 magnitude, meaning the March 11 quake was four times as powerful as the presumed maximum.Yew... 8.6 to 9 is FOUR TIMES 8.6! And we have DDM in Delhi reporting that Delhi cant stand a Richter scale 8 quake, which is like ""Japan"" . Remember, I mentioned that quote of how 1.1 is similar to 1.9 because they start with 1 ?. If 8.6 to 9 is FOUR Times, what will 8 to 9 be like?Shogo Fukuda, a TEPCO spokesman, said that 8.6 was the maximum magnitude entered into the TEPCO internal computer modeling for Fukushima Dai-ichi.Another TEPCO spokesman, Motoyasu Tamaki, used a new buzzword, ""sotegai,"" or ""outside our imagination,"" to describe what actually occurred.Ah ""Sotegai"" sounds like Japanese Speako for Black Swan .. In Yindi, Kaala Hans!U.S. tsunami experts said that one reason the estimates for Fukushima Dai-ichi were so low was the way Japan calculates risk. Because of the island nation's long history of killer waves, Japanese experts often will look at what has happened — then project forward what is likely to happen again.Ah. But Sanku wants to do that. Now you say that is flawed? How dare you, Harrumph!Under longstanding U.S. standards that are gaining popularity around the world, risk assessments typically scheme up a worst-case scenario based on what could happen, then design a facility like a nuclear power plant to withstand such a collection of conditions — factoring in just about everything short of an extremely unlikely cataclysm, like a large meteor hitting the ocean and creating a massive wave that kills hundreds of thousands.Wooww. woow . Meteorite falling and setting off a massive wave ?. Didn't some one post about such a thing in this very same possibility some 2 to 3 pages back in this very same thread to point out the absurdity of the deterministic model.. A certain Vina , aka your's truly ?In the early 1990s, Harry Yeh, now a tsunami expert and engineering professor at Oregon State University, was helping assess potential threats to the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant on the central California coast in the United States. During that exercise, he said, researchers considered a worst-case scenario involving a significantly larger earthquake than had ever been recorded there.And then a tsunami was added. And in that Diablo Canyon model, the quake hit during a monster storm that was already pushing onto the shore higher waves than had ever been measured at the site.In contrast, when TEPCO calculated its high-water mark at 18 feet (5.7 meters), the anticipated maximum earthquake was in the same range as others recorded off the coast of Fukushima Dai-ichi — and the only assumption about the water level was that the tsunami arrived at high tide.Well, they did exactly what Sanku wanted to do. And indeed, even topped it with a high tide assumption and now you blame them ?  Which, as is abundantly clear now, could not have been more wrong. [/quote]Indeed. But does that address the fundamental point? WHAT IS THE ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF RISK ?  You can arrive at a BETTER estimate based on better probabilistic estimate. But does it GUARANTEE as NO RISK.

But then we need backups to be used in case of war -when the solar plant I mentioned will be quite vulnerable because it will be spread around over a large area, or the off-shore wind-farms which will be vulnerable to tsunamis, and big dams are of course even more of a danger because they can be used to also flood populations. Would not then consider the possibility of a nuclear plant which actually has a small footprint in land terms, is completely enclosable in a protective concrete bomb proof dome [not easy with the other plants - and the fuel stocks you need for coal or oil]?Nuclear is not the same animal. This argument is very hard to defend.We don't bomb proof coal plants or wind farms or solar plants, just have redundant systems in case of damage so others can take the slack. The problem is the shortage of electricity. In case of Nuclear failure the plant itself becomes the source of alarm. The shortage of electricity is barely registered. A absolute worst case scenario nuclear failure near a densely populated city will involve casualties in the 100,000+ range and long term, 500 years+, environmental exclusion zone type situation. No other technology we have comes close to that.I'm of the view that such an accident is now a simple matter of time. We are playing Russian roulette. So far we have had 3-mile, Chernobyl and Fukushima. We have been very very lucky in all three cases. Yes even at Chernobyl. Sooner or later our luck will run out.

Ships rarely notice their passage.As the tsunami approaches the coast and the waters become shallow, wave shoaling compresses the wave and its velocity slows below 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph). Its wavelength diminishes to less than 20 kilometres (12 mi) and its amplitude grows enormously. Since the wave still has the same very long period, the tsunami may take minutes to reach full height."

So far, officials have said that levels outside the plant are low. But how do they know how much radiation is harmful? Risk calculations are based heavily on a 63-year study of 94,000 people who survived the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan in August 1945. It is one of the largest, longest population studies ever done; for radiation safety, it is the gold standard. Its breadth and precision are “magnificent,” says John Boice, scientific director of the International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Maryland, and former chief of radiation epidemiology at the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda, Maryland.Up to 200,000 people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima died soon after the bomb blasts— some from radiation sickness—but more survived. To understand the delayed effects of radiation, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences launched a joint study with Japan of bomb survivors, using a 1950 census to track them down. Initial case reports of cataracts, leukemia, and birth defects eventually became a long-term study to follow cancer and other illnesses in about 94,000 survivors and 26,000 unexposed residents. It was run by a U.S. and Japanese–funded agency eventually named the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF).Researchers “spent a huge amount of time reconstructing where people were ATB, at time of blast,” says epidemiologist Richard Monson of Harvard University. They asked subjects whether they were inside or outdoors, near a window, upstairs or downstairs, and which direction they faced. They even constructed a mock Japanese village in the Nevada desert, hoisted a uranium reactor up in a tower, and measured the neutrons it spewed to study the movement of radiation through the air and into buildings. To fine-tune gamma-radiation estimates, researchers tested ceramic roof tiles on Japanese houses for a high-energy electron signature, says Tore Straume of NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. The dosimetry underwent several revisions over the decades.Other RERF researchers monitored the health of survivors. Using death records and cancer registries, they soon documented leukemias, particularly in the young, tallying 219 deaths by 2002 in people receiving a significant exposure—a 45% rise above the number expected. It appeared to peak in 1950. By the 1970s, researchers were tracking an elevated rate of solid cancers; “it looks like it persists for a lifetime,” says NCI epidemiologist Kiyohiko Mabuchi.Still, “people's perceptions of cancer caused are probably different from reality,” says biostatistician Dale Preston of Hirosoft International, who worked at RERF for 23 years. Leukemias were relatively rare, and although by 1998 about 7851 survivors in the study who received significant exposures developed solid cancers, only 850 cases, or 11%, have been attributed to radiation. (The cancer risk was about 50% higher for those who received at least 1 sievert of radiation; the risk drops with dose to 2% below 0.1 sievert. Lifetime risks are lower; for an exposure of 0.250 sieverts, the allowed limit for workers at the Daiichi plant, the increased risk of ever developing cancer is about 2.5%, Boice says.)Data from hundreds of medical studies have been used to bolster the A-bomb– survivor results. In the early 20th century, before the risks were recognized, radiation was used to diagnose or treat everything from mastitis to tonsillitis—and some patients developed cancer, Boice notes. Studies of workers—such as women who applied radium paint to clock dials and later developed bone cancer—also proved useful. Studies of about 21,000 workers exposed to radiation starting in 1948 at the former Soviet Union's Mayak nuclear weapons plant, and of 30,000 villagers nearby along the Techa River, are proving “important,” Preston says: The cohorts received a wide range of radiation doses, and many workers inhaled plutonium, a long-lived radioisotope absent in the Japanese A-bomb survivors.These studies and others of nuclear workers “in general have supported estimates from the A-bomb survivors,” says NCI's Ethel Gilbert. Controversy remains, however, about whether the bomb survivors' brief, one-time exposure would be as harmful if spread over many years. “It's the one major unanswered question,” Boice says.Studies of nuclear accidents have been less useful for estimating dose responses, although they confirm that it's hard to see health effects from low-level exposures. The 1979 accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania exposed the nearby population to a “trivial” amount of radiation, Boice says; health effects were not detected. The 1986 Chernobyl accident, on the other hand, spewed iodine-131 and cesium-137 for 10 days in a plume that reached 5 million people. Researchers expect that 4000 excess cancer deaths will eventually result. But precise dose information is lacking even for the “liquidators,” the 600,000 workers who helped clean up, says Mabuchi, making it difficult to link exposure to disease.The only clear health effect among the public from Chernobyl so far has been more than 6000 cases of thyroid cancer (15 of them fatal), mainly in people who as children and adolescents drank milk from cows that fed on grass tainted with iodine-131. This should “not be a problem in Japan” because contaminated milk and vegetables are being removed from the food supply, says radiologist Fred Mettler of the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, a consultant to the United Nations on the Chernobyl disaster.Studies of the A-bomb survivors (40% of the original group are still living) continue at RERF. A few of its 45 researchers are helping Japanese officials monitor the population near the Daiichi plant, says RERF vice chair and research chief Roy Shore. They're also discussing a possible study of the hundreds of workers involved in keeping the plant under control. If the Fukushima crisis becomes another Chernobyl, Shore says, “we'd certainly want to compile all the data we could.”"
889,abhishek_sharma,29 Mar 2011 08:30 ,"Quake Questionshttp://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/03/quake-question-10-why-are-spent.htmlReaders ask: Does the life of the rods affect their radioactive capabilities? Like, if they were getting near the end of their effective life, are they more or less dangerous? Are the rods the only danger, or are there other components, like cooling tanks or hydrogen containers, that are also dangerous with radioactive meltdown? Once the reactor's control rods are between sections of fuel rods, how is fission slowed to where it is controllable? It seems the control rods aren't adequate to regain control of the fission.Science answers: Spent fuel is more dangerous because it contains a mixture of fission products, some of which can be long-lived radioactive waste, and also plutonium which is highly toxic.In a boiling water reactor like those at Fukushima, the same water that cools the reactor core also boils and drives the turbine to generate power. This means that some radioactive material gets into the turbine and condensers and pumps, but these are usually very short-lived radionuclides.  http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/03/quake-question-9-why-didnt-react.htmlReaders ask: By what mechanism is a reactor shut down (to replace spent fuel, for instance)? Did that mechanism fail after the quake? If not, why are the cores experiencing meltdowns?Science answers: A reactor is shut down by inserting control rods between the fuel rods. The control rods are made of a neutron-absorbing material, so that they slow the rate of fission reactions. In a boiling water reactor like the ones at Fukushima, the fuel rods remain hot even after the reactor is shut down because of spontaneous fissions from the nuclear fuel and fission products. Hence the reactor needs to have a supply of cooling water even when shut down.Following the earthquake, automatic systems shut down those reactors that were still operating, inserting control upward from below the core in a boiling water reactor. But the loss of electricity from the power grid meant that the water pumps stopped working. When the backup generators, powered by diesel fuel, where knocked out by the tsunami, there was no system left to replenish the cooling water. The heat from fuel rods continued to boil away the cooling water until eventually the core was exposed to the air.As the temperature rose around the core, the zircaloy cladding on the fuel rods began to react with the steam, oxidizing and releasing hydrogen. Nuclear plant workers, concerned about the buildup of pressure in the containment vessels, vented some of the gas inside. It was the hydrogen in this escaping gas that exploded, destroying the buildings around reactors 1, 3, and 4.  http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/03/quake-question-7-what-prevents-a.htmlReaders ask: What's to stop the reactors' ""spent"" fuel rods from open-air burning during an uncontrolled nuclear fire? I understand these fuel rods are kept on top of the reactors but outside the vessel containment structure. Are they already exposed to the open air? The explosions seen on TV seemed to take the tops off of the reactor buildings. Are American reactors configured the same way?Science answers: The director of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said that water has drained from at least one of the spent fuel pools at the Fukushima site, the site of the nuclear crisis. (Japanese officials deny this.) This raises the possibility that the temperature of the rods, which are still radioactive, could rise, setting on fire the zirconium cladding, which keeps the rods together. That fire would spew radioactive fuel far and wide. What normally prevents this from happening is the water, if the cooling system is working properly.U.S. reactors are split between boiling water reactors, like the Fukushima ones, which tend to store spent nuclear fuel within the reactor buildings above ground, and pressurized water reactors. PWRs, as they're known, usually store fuel below ground, and thus they presumably face less risk of losing the water for cooling. "
890,abhishek_sharma,29 Mar 2011 08:39 ,"JAPAN DISASTER: Devastating Earthquake Defied Expectationshttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6023/1375.fullEven for a nation inured to temblors and bracing for the Big One, last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami were beyond imagination. Experts, too, were caught off-guard. “I never thought this kind of [event] could happen” in this region, says Hiroo Kanamori, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.The earthquake's astonishing power and unexpected location also expose the futility of forecasting where and when the next Big One will hit, says Robert Geller, a geophysicist at the University of Tokyo. Even in a country as extensively instrumented and thoroughly studied as Japan, he says, major quakes always “seem to be ones not expected.”The 11 March Tohoku earthquake ranks among the five strongest temblors recorded by modern instrumentation. The U.S. Geological Survey and the Japan Meteorological Agency now peg the magnitude at 9.0. The quake ruptured more than 400 kilometers of crust along the Japan Trench subduction zone, where a tectonic plate is diving beneath the northeast coast of Honshu Island. Its epicenter was 130 kilometers east of Sendai, a city of about 1 million people in Miyagi Prefecture, and 373 kilometers northeast of Tokyo. Authorities expect the death toll to top 15,000. Tsunami waves that exceeded 7 meters in height when they came ashore washed away scores of communities and inflicted damage as far away as California. The tragedy may yet be compounded by ongoing crises at two nuclear power plants, where workers were racing to prevent reactor core meltdowns and contain radiation leaks as Science went to press.Japan sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where about 90% of the world's earthquakes occur as tectonic plates bump and grind over and under one another. Along the Japan Trench, the Pacific Plate is being forced under the Okhotsk Plate. In some regions, the subducting plate slides smoothly under the overriding plate. In other areas, plates couple, or stick together, at their interface. If strongly coupled, the plates' boundary regions are twisted until the rock can no longer bear the strain. At that point, a slip or rupture along the boundary allows the plates to snap back into lower-stress positions, releasing accumulated energy as earthquake waves. The concurrent sea-floor movement produces tsunamis.To assess earthquake risk in a given region, scientists look to past events for guidance. Records for northeastern Japan go back more than a century. Along the Japan Trench, earthquakes of magnitude 7 to about 8.3 have struck at 30- to 50-year intervals. According to Kanamori, recent earthquakes along the subduction zone relieved so much stress that it would have been hard to see where in the region enough strain had accumulated to produce a great earthquake. “Truthfully, we didn't foresee this,” says Takuya Nishimura, a geodesist at the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan in Tsukuba who co-authored a 2004 paper in Geophysical Journal International detailing the buildup of crustal deformation in the region.An earthquake was anticipated off the coast of Miyagi where the 11 March event occurred, but it was expected to be much smaller. Historical records and instrumental observations indicated that for this smaller section of the subduction zone, earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or so recur every 30 to 40 years. The most recent was a magnitude-7.4 event in 1978 that killed 28 and triggered a small tsunami. The rupture zone of the 11 March earthquake “overlaps but is much greater than the source area of the 1978 earthquake,” which ruptured only about 50 kilometers of the fault, Nishimura says.Peering deeper into the past, researchers a few years ago recognized an event of similar intensity to the 11 March disaster. Historical records tell of a large earthquake and the coastal plain becoming a “wilderness of water” in the year 869. A telltale marine sand layer buried in marshy deposits on the Sendai Plain revealed that the ancient tsunami must have run as much as 3 to 4 kilometers inland from the coastline at the time. Based on the extent of the inundation, researchers estimated the magnitude of the Jogan earthquake at roughly 8.3. Local media report having found traces of last week's tsunami 5 kilometers or more inland.If the Tohoku earthquake was a reprise of Jogan, supercycles of massive earthquakes may rock the region on 1000-year time scales, Nishimura says. Supercycles, of course, would not be limited to one segment of the Japan Trench, he says: “This event suggests that such kinds of great earthquakes might occur in other subduction zones.” One candidate is the Cascadia fault, which runs off the coast from northern California to southern British Columbia. Last week's earthquake “is going to be the benchmark for the Pacific Northwest when the Cascadia fault breaks,” says seismologist John Vidale of the University of Washington, Seattle. “We know that it can have an earthquake of this magnitude. It's a question of when, not if.”One worry is how the 11 March earthquake may influence neighboring sections of the Japan Trench. “We are really concerned” that the release of stress offshore of northeast Honshu has increased the chances of a large quake much closer to Tokyo, says seismologist Shinji Toda of Kyoto University. His preliminary calculations suggest that the earthquake loaded stress onto the fault segment offshore of Boso Peninsula, a finger of land separating Tokyo Bay from the Pacific Ocean. Historical records indicate a large earthquake and tsunami battered the area in 1677.The Tohoku earthquake will offer sobering lessons for risk assessment. Since 1965, Japanese seismologists have diligently watched real-time data from hundreds of instruments in the Tokai region west of Tokyo. If a fault along the Nankai Trough were to grow restless, a panel of seismologists would assemble on a moment's notice to decide whether to warn of an impending magnitude-8 earthquake. Authorities have strengthened public buildings to withstand intense shaking and have built dikes and floodgates along the coast to thwart the anticipated tsunami from such a temblor.But Japan's two great earthquakes of the past 2 decades—the 11 March event and the Kobe earthquake of 1995—showed that experts were looking in the wrong place. Similarly, Kanamori says, in California attention is focused on the San Andreas fault, even though the most damaging earthquakes of the past several decades—including the 1994 magnitude-6.7 Northridge and the 1971 magnitude-6.6 San Fernando earthquakes—occurred elsewhere.Researchers are able to estimate how much seismic strain will accumulate in a fault over time. “What we cannot predict is the individual sequence. It may be released in a single earthquake or may be released in smaller events,” Kanamori says. “In view of the inevitable uncertainty, in my opinion it's better to have a more general approach [to earthquake preparation] than to have a prioritized, focused effort.” For a nation that prides itself on preparedness, a distressing realization might be that some earthquakes are just too big, and too rare, to prepare for."

Yes. The LalBrof and LalChix have it right. Drumrolls pliss !!    .Indeed that is the point I have been saying in my earlier posts on this thread.However no one answered my quiz on VikAd and Vikrant on the surface and Arihant and others underwater in one of my replies to Bade Mian's post       .And no one wants to buy my India Tsunami Protection Options either!    Yes, the current engineering (including Gen III +) of the Nuke Plants are incremental in nature ,based on a 1950s /1st gen philosophy and based on investment protection and marginal investment business case of the established nuclear establishment.  They make more money when they can tweak existing designs minimally, build large complex nuke plants and then make a continuous cash flow by offering ""services"" and selling custom fuel for the daily operation of the plant. Sort of like  a HP Printer and Cartridge example (though HP practically gives the printer away because it is a highly competitive market, the existing guys have made the system so complex that it costs a bum to set up the plant).The industry needs fundamentally new disruptive designs that are fail safe. The only one of that was the PBMR kind of stuff , but even then more conventional things can be done. Stuff like LOCA has to be catered to , assuming that it WILL happen , and the plant doesn't go Paki when it does . The current effort (like the Gen1 designs of the 50s is to build redundancy and hope that it doesn't happen), but however a station blackout can scupper it.. a single point of failure. Now, pliss to answer the kwij on Arihant below the surface and you can get hints on the kind of reactors that can become possible. Minaturized, small sized ones , completely underwater in the seas, no LOCA possible, no pakiness, possibly situated in the bosom of a concrete gravity stabilized offshore rig kind of structure with large concrete ""boorqas"" with massive reserve of water ityadi and immediate heat transfer in a shutdown state to the sink kind of jazz and even entombing it in a concrete boorqa in a dire situation is just easy by pumping in concrete. In fact, from the common pics we see of research reactors, completely under the pool, and certified to run for a couple of weeks with no need for any watch whatsoever is the kind of model to go for. Yes, you need fundamentally new engineering and make it failsafe. Building Tsunami walls, raising height is secondary.Okay, lets take Sanku and Channakya's case of history based planning (thought he 38m at Fukushima definitely NEVER happened, there would be records of it), you build a 38m capable wall and cater to the current event or even put in a 10% margin, how do you know that the next event is NOT going to be a greater than your design  wave with 100% certainty ?  You cant. It is statistically impossible.  You cant control that. You can only control what you can. That is your design.What the GOI should do is to reject all current GenIII kind of designs offered and spur the DAE and the indian establishment and issue a challenge/RFP/whatever to the world at large for a reactor design that is failsafe against all possible reactor failure modes and only when proven ,go for a big construction spree.The Fukushima incident is a timely reminder that all in all, the nuke industry (possibly because it got nearly killed and was starved of investment), has really not progressed much engineering wise beyond the Gen 1 types and any improvement has been rather marginal and not fundamental/radical/step change."

For every doomsday article about how the world is coming to an end due to Fukushima there are others which show that while the situation is bad it's not cataclysmic in nature.Amit saar,It is not a question of whether nuke is cataclysimic or not. It is bringing to the table an informed opinion. I’m afraid certain posters take the BRF motto of ‘being ahead of the curve’ a bit too seriously. Let us look at this objectively.Fact: A tsunami / earthquake knocks out power generators at Fukashima, leading to LOCA and venting/leakage of radioactive material. TEPCO / IAEA says that it is a serious accident hence emergency provisions are initiated – viz. evacuation, radiation monitoring, isolation of tainted food / milk and most importantly – transmission channels of information (None of these happened in Chernobyl where there was a core meltdown and most deaths there are occurring due to people who drank the contaminated milk. So in that sense this is a huge improvement in processes).Tepco also increases the permissible level of dosage in a nuke emergency for workers from 100 msv to 250 msv (this is still below the IAEA emergency allowable limits of 500 msv). Certain death due to radiation happens at around 10,000 msv – just to put it in perspective.With these facts one can have a rational discussion. But no, predictions flow forth! Prediction 1: This is a disaster of unimaginable proportion – reactor explosion is imminent! (response: nope)Prediction 2: This is a disaster of unimaginable proportion – reactor meltdown is imminent! (response: nope)Prediction 3: This is a disaster of unimaginable proportion – there is radiation in air and water! (response: duh that was what IAEA has told us and is also providing the levels of radiation for perspective )Prediction 4: This is a disaster of unimaginable proportion – workers are being exposed to more than 100 msv ! (response: yes and please check the facts above)Prediction 5: This is a disaster of unimaginable proportion – radiation in sea is 100,000,000 times normal level ! (response: nope that was a faulty reading and has been pointed out)Prediction 6: This is a disaster of unimaginable proportion – IAEA is holding a conference on what went wrong! (response: nope this is what organizations do)Regarding your options, how about an option (f) which includes developing a mechanisim of 'self denial', that we seem to have done with coal related deaths"

One team made gamma dose-rate measurements in the Tokyo and Chiba region at 3 locations. Gamma-dose rates measured ranged from 0.08 to 0.13 microsievert per hour, which is within or slightly above the background. The second team made additional measurements at distances of 30 to 46 km from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. At these locations, the dose rates ranged from 0.5 to 3 microsievert per hour. At the same locations, results of beta-gamma contamination measurements ranged from 0.02 to 0.3 Megabecquerel per square metre.New results from the marine monitoring stations 30 km off-shore were received for seawater samples taken on 26 March. The levels decreased at most of the locations. For iodine-131 the concentration results for four monitoring stations are between 6 to 18 becquerel per litre, and for caesium-137 between ""below limit of detection"" and 16 becquerel per litre. The dose rates measured on the sea surface remain relatively low between 0.04 and 0.1 microsievert per hour. Samples collected on 26 March 330 metres east of the discharge point showed increasing concentrations. There were found to be 74,000 becquerel per litre for iodine-131, 12,000 becquerel per litre for caesium-137, and 12,000 becquerel per litre for caesium-134.It is still too early to draw conclusions for expected concentrations in marine food, because the situation can change rapidly. Modelling results show an initial north-eastern transport of liquid releases from the damaged reactors. Monitoring of iodine-131 and cesium-137 in drinking water is on-going. Iodine-131 has been monitored by the Japanese authorities in 2 of 10 samples taken in the Fukushima prefecture with values of 60 and 90 becquerel per litre. In the Ibaraki prefectures, iodine-131 was detected in 2 of 9 samples, the values were 40 and 90 becquerel per litre. The Japanese limits for the ingestion of drinking water by infants is 100 becquerel per litre. Shiv-ji, good point about CAT scans and breaches.  From the IAEA statements over the last few days, the breach is suspected because of changes in pressure readings and the higher level of radiation in a pool of water under the reactor.  However there is no hard evidence at this time that a breach has occured.  the authorities are proceeding on the basis that one may well have occured and are safeguarding the workers on site accordingly (i.e. exposure time).Reports today (see above link) suggest that the instrumentation is almost back up and that temperatures and pressures are declining.  Much more likely to have occured (note I said likely and therefore its a hypothesis) than a breach is a failed or leaking valve or pipe.  The reactor is able to vent steam, therefore a likely point of failure is that mechanism rather than the core pressure vessel or the containment vesselone drawback of this power plant design is that primary cooling water from the reactor core drives the steam turbines directly (or atleast that is what was reported).  that would mean radiated water passing through machinery - and therefore making the design less safe.

Radioactive iodine-131 was discovered just offshore from Unit 5 and Unit 6 at a level 1,150 times higher than normal, Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told reporters.===========================================http://www.spiegel.de/international/wor ... 30,00.htmlHow Dangerous Is Japan's Creeping Nuclear Disaster?""We are experiencing an ongoing, massive release of radioactivity,"" says Wolfram König, head of Germany's Federal Office for Radiation Protection. ""And everyone should know by now that this isn't over by a long shot."" Nuclear expert Helmut Hirsch says: ""All I hear is that people are wondering whether this will turn into a meltdown. But the thing is, it already is a partial meltdown."" The difference, in this case, is that Fukushima is a creeping disaster. Another 62,000 people live within the 30-kilometer zone. The head of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Agency (NRC) recommends expanding the evacuation zone to 80 kilometers, in which case 2 million people would have to be relocated Instruments in a helicopter flying over the plant measured 80 millisievert of radiation at an altitude of 40 meters (131 feet) above the roof of the plant, with levels dropping to only 4 millisievert 200 meters higher up. This suggests that the radiation is coming directly from the holding pools.For example, the highest reported hourly dose at the edge of the evacuation zone was 0.16 millisievert.

The Green Party is a major opposition party in Germany and plays a part in coalition governments at the State (Lande) and Federal levels.  The Greens have consistently been anti-nuclear on principle.  Currently the German parliament is in the process of debating a nuclear bill which seeks to resume investment in new nuclear plants.  Just like Kangress will do deals with small parties to gather votes for majority, so will the main German parties.  The issue in Germany has much more to do with local politics than what is actually happening in Fukushima.  Expect both sides of the debate to come out with strong opinions.  Now that may be fine, but just across the Rhine river in France nuclear plants make up 80% of the electrical generation capacity.  Any disaster there will affect Germany just as much as it does France.  In a sense, the Greens may be ideologically sound, but practically displaying tactical brilliance like a well known ex-jarnailOn Energy:Whilst we would all love to reduce our energy consumption, the raw truth is that demand for energy is rising very rapidly and the massive economies of China and India are creating the most demand.  Not just for lights and a/c's but for industrialisation and urbanisation.  This demand for power - and massive base-load capacity is not going to decline.  Apart from nuclear, the only things that can economically create large base loads is coal and oil.  These generate large amounts of toxic pollution and also massive releases of CO2, which appear to be a strong component of accelerated climate change.  Gas, Solar, Tidal, even Hydro power are great at peak load generation, but even massive capacity increases in these will not easily match the baseload requirements.  If we chose not to use nuclear technology, we must do so with our eyes wide open.  If we are to reduce our dependence on hydrocarbons, in the absence of fusion technology, we are taken down the road towards fission technology.So, we come back to what is a safe way to use nuclear energy?  However, that is for the Indian Nuclear dhaga and not this one."

The nuclear power plants we agree to set up today, like the one in Maharashtra for example, would only come on stream after 2015. Let's for argument's sake, take 2015. Now these plants are expected to keep generating electricity for 50 years at the minimum. Actually more if you go by the Nuclear Liability Bill date of 80 years or if you take the example of Fukushima, which is already 40 years old. Even if we take 50 years, then in say for example 2060 the plant would be generating around 1000 MW of power. Now try to calculate what would be the cost of oil and/or gas that would be required to generate an equivalent of 1000MW in 2060. Also try to visualise what kind of pollution we'd be having (not the mention radiation, remember coal plants emit 200 time more radiation than nuclear power plants) over this 50 year period. Only dirty coal-fired plants could be a viable alternative to nuclear.As of now nuclear is the only way to go for countries like India which need to exponentially increase power generation. It's OK for stable economies like those of Germany which in any case is power surplus to dilly dally and tinker with various options, India does not have this luxury.the new Gen III LWRs apparently enable the plant to switch from 30% to 80% capacity in very short time (I posted a link sometime back)...Which will dramatically change the commercial contours of nuclear power..Of course they have.

The nordic region and holland have good markets in these and gas trading is gaining in popularity.  the risk management of gas contracts is very much in focus.  what is key is that any country has a portfolio of power generation assets and supply chains in order to guarantee a steady supply.  the US saw massive blackouts a few years ago because gas/oil prices shot through the roof and the power companies couldn't afford to buy fuel.  In a portfolio model, maintaining reliability in base load supply is very critical.  most developed economies have HUGE baseload requirements and generally very short lived but high peak load requirements, e.g. during football matches, or during commercial breaks during popular programmes on TV (one of the highest demand spikes in the UK was created by the simultaneous switching on of millions of electric kettles to make tea during a commercial break during a very popular soap operas... the grid barely managed to keep functioning!)in 'developed economy' power supply/demand balance scenarios therefore, there is a huge need for cheap, reliable and available baseload by the TW.  gas simply is not affordable for thistherefore nuclear - though and this is very important - capex for nukes is usually underwritten by government funds - which is the price paid for energy security"

Does this perspective presuppose that nuclear energy is panacea or does it highlight the fact that nuclear energy is one more small piece of the energy puzzle.Currently on a global scale only 3% of energy needs are met by nuclear energy.  That is also reflected closely in Indian scene, where less than 2% of energy is through nuclear route.Optimistically, even if it is magically increased to meet 8% of energy needs in India, it still is not going to be a game changer for a whole lot of Indian masses. But, having said that every avenue needs to be tapped, including nuclear and/or non. To claim that nuclear energy alone is going to propel India out of dark ages is a pitch by vested interests who will gain by selling that kind of snake oil.  Realistic assesment what it can and what it cannot do is the need of the hour.There are all the usual arguments for and against usage of nuclear fuel for energy needs.  (The peak nuclear fuel availability, such as peak oil scenario needs to be factored in.  Some estimates by 2045 world will run out of natural reserves of nuclear fuel.  Any references would be helpful.)My vote is for D). We should return to our Indic roots and Vedic times. Why do we need electricity at all?But there may be an element of truth, in the above assertion.Because vedic way guarantees preservation of life, while other neo scientific way is trying to enhance life-style with a potential to end life over a larger footprint. Life-style without life will be meaningless. Balance is the key.The main argument should be to realistically assess the merits and demerits of centralized energy generation versus distributed energy generation: and life time cost associated with each of the paths.Bottom line, nuclear energy is not going to dramatically alter the life style of all Indians.  But it will mitigate some of the needs and there is no need to shun it, when properly done.  Beyond that insisting: by going nuclear energy route as coming of age life style statement is just hookey.What does this imply?  It means if one has limited means of resources at ones disposal, it is wise to invest prudently in different energy paths, and not put all eggs in one basket."

The 1979 accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania exposed the nearby population to a “trivial” amount of radiation, Boice says; health effects were not detected. The 1986 Chernobyl accident, on the other hand, spewed iodine-131 and cesium-137 for 10 days in a plume that reached 5 million people. Researchers expect that 4000 excess cancer deaths will eventually result. But precise dose information is lacking even for the “liquidators,” the 600,000 workers who helped clean up, says Mabuchi, making it difficult to link exposure to disease.The only clear health effect among the public from Chernobyl so far has been more than 6000 cases of thyroid cancer (15 of them fatal), mainly in people who as children and adolescents drank milk from cows that fed on grass tainted with iodine-131. This should “not be a problem in Japan”1 - The ""4000"" excess deaths was low-end estimation  by  most experts (at least from those  outside  - then  USSR). Most though (I included) the numbers would be many times higher. Unlike Japan, we did not have quantitative data.. From radiation levels in Europe, we were able to calculate that   many tons of (actual amount turned out to be thousand ton or so of all the material put together)  must have spewed out. Later learned that people near Chernobyl learned the seriousness from shortwave broadcasts and not from official sources.  They wondered why there was yellow mud, just after rain. ityadi ityadi .. (I highly recommend reading about this from any good source, there is much to learn from that horrible accident) 2- Milk from cows that fed on grass tainted with I-131 was bad.  Worse was  that many [i]actually added Iodine  in milk (I did not know  that before, but  some add it in  milk like some of us,  add haldi). (By Iodine, I don't mean KI tablets aka Japan - but Iodine laced with I-131). Again we could learn something from this.3.  There is much learning for us by reading about how  they organized those  600,000 workers who helped clean up (areas with such high radiation that 'safe' limit some time lasted minutes of exposure only) 4.

For Pete's sake 17,000 people have died, the infrastructure is in a shambles and on top of that Fukushima. And we sit safely in front of our computers and rant against their alleged ""incompetence"".

This analysis evaluated cancer incidence in Hiroshima and Nagasaki between 1958 and 1987. The overall age-adjusted (World Population Standard) cancer incidence has increased from 217 to 301 per 100,000 among males, and from 176 to 197 per 100,000 among females during the first 30 years of cancer registration. The most recent rates are intermediate to rates in other countries. Based on these figures my rough calculation tells me that the figure 850,000 cancer deaths from Chernobyl alone would require a total radiation exposed population (from Chernobyl) of 87 million people over 20 years or 1,750 million (1.75 billion)  people in the first year after Chernobyl - assuming a 20% increase in cancer rate.There is nothing to indicate that such huge numbers were affected. The total is greater than the population of Russia and Western Europe in 1988."

951,Amber G.,30 Mar 2011 07:59 ,"Hello all: This appeared in Wall Street  Journal  in 83, yet in many ways still very relevant to the present situation.  Most Scientists Reject Radiation PhobiaBernard L. CohenPolls of college students and members of the League of Women Voters in Oregon found that both groups believe that nuclear power is their No. 1 ""present risk of death,"" outranking motor-vehicle accidents that kill 50,000 Americans each year and 12 other hazards that kill more than 1,000 each. Yet scientific studies find that the number of deaths expected from nuclear power, including accidents, radioactive waste and everything else, is less than 10 per year; even the principal anti-nuclear activist organization, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), estimates less than 150. Clearly, even well-educated segments of the American public are badly misinformed.Another poll found that more that 80% of the public believes that nuclear power is more dangerous than its principal competitor, coal burning, which is typically estimated to kill 10,000 Americans each year with its air pollution -- some studies estimate 50,000. Every single study (at least 20, including one by UCS) has reached the opposite conclusion, that coal burning is much more dangerous. Clearly, the 80% is badly misinformed.As a consequence of this misinformation, we are spending hundreds of millions of dollars per life saved by protecting people from radiation, while we are disdaining to spend one-thousandth of that amount to protect people from disease, automobile accidents, and other common dangers.This is a tragic situation, unnecessarily killing thousands of people and wasting billions of dollars every year. Who is to blame? Since the public gets its nuclear information from the media, electronic and print, journalism must be the culprit. Let's see how it has operated.One of its worst sins is over coverage. More than 100 accidents involving transport of radioactive material have received national media coverage in the past few decades, but the radiation exposure in all of them combined has less than a 1% chance of causing even a single death. How does this square with the 300 Americans killed in accidents every day, with hardly any media coverage? There was tremendous coverage of the Three Mile Island (TMI) accident although all investigations have concluded that there was never any significant danger to the public -- the media still haven't transmitted that message and continue to imply that TMI was a near miss on disaster.Another problem with nuclear journalism is the use of inflammatory language -- ""deadly radiation,"" and ""lethal radioactivity."" Why do we never hear about ""deadly"" automobiles or ""lethal"" electricity that electrocutes 1,200 Americans per year? Or about ""lethal"" water that drowns 8,000 each year?Another journalistic failing is in not trying to help the public understand the dangers of radiation. The best way to do this, always used by scientists in trying to enlighten the public, is to compare the radiation being reported with the much higher radiation doses we all receive from natural sources or medical X-rays. The radiation due to an accident in Rochester, N.Y., nuclear plant last year was a leading national news story for two days, but with all that coverage the public was never told that no one got as much radiation as he gets every day from natural sources.The media frequently imply that health effects of radiation are poorly understood by scientists. Actually, every involved scientist recognizes that radiation effects are far better understood than air pollution, food additives, chemical wastes and almost any environmental agent. In contrast with the latter examples, all national and international scientific commissions charged with estimating the health effects of radiation obtain similar results.Journalists continually consult a small handful of ""renegade"" scientists who have been trying to frighten the public about the dangers of radiation. They very seldom give well respected scientists a chance to rebut their arguments, choosing instead to use utility executives or government bureaucrats, with the all-but-open implication that their credibility is suspect.How can a journalist tell who is a ""respected scientist"" or what is a scientific ""consensus"" on a subject? It's easy. Call a few randomly chosen high-quality universities; ask to speak to a professor of radiation health, and pop the question. The results would be at least 95% consistent in most cases. When journalists interviewing me question my statements, I always ask them to do this but no one ever has. The usual journalist line is that the scientific community is split -- they imply into equal halves --{  } on the dangers of radiation, with one side dominated by government -- or industry supported scientists fearful of economic reprisal.Journalists frequently make implicit judgments on scientific issues, treating them like political or social issues on which everyone is entitled to an opinion. They do not recognize that a scientific consensus is based on vast amounts of data, techniques and experience, and is normally agreed upon by over 90% of those possessing these. The public wants and is entitled to be informed of the scientific consensus, but instead it gets the opinions of journalists. For example, to the question, ""Are the estimated dangers of radiation larger now than they were 10 years ago?"" the scientific consensus is a resounding ""no,"" but the media has told the public that it is ""yes."" Note that this is a strictly scientific question, with no room for political considerations.But the worst journalist sin is failure to put risks into perspective. People can understand new risks only by comparing them with risks that are familiar.  {Hence banana equivalent dose  }Let's do it here, deriving the nuclear risk estimates from typical scientific analyses but also including (in parenthesis) those from the anti-nuclear UCS. The present risk to the average American from the nuclear-power industry is equivalent to that of smoking one cigarette in one's life (one cigarette per year according to UCS), of an overweight person increasing his weight by 0.004 ounces (0.2 ounces), crossing a street one extra time every three years (every three weeks) or increasing the national speed limit form 55 to 55.003 (55.13) miles per hour.I doubt if 1% of our citizenry recognizes that the risks of nuclear power are as low as indicated by these comparisons. By failing to put these risks into proper perspective, journalists have failed in their responsibility to inform the American public.These failures of journalism are costing our nation thousands of unnecessary deaths and wasting billions of dollars every year. Moreover, they have quadrupled the inflation-corrected cost of new electric power in the U.S., making it twice as expensive as in Europe or Japan. We can only surmise what economic havoc this will wreak in the next few decades.This article appeared in The Wall Street Journal on 11/30/83, but it still applies today, in 2002. Bernard L. Cohen has authored six books and over 300 papers in scientific journals, and he was awarded the Health Physics Society Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award.Link:http://russp.org/nucpower.htm"

But is it wise to turn the fear into paranoia?Sure 1/millionth gram speck of Pu in your lungs can kill you but so can pollution from dirty coal-fired power plants that find your way to your lung or the cigarette smoke that goes into your lungs because your co-worker smokes.You have a better chance of surviving an accident when traveling in a bus or train than if you were in a plane that went down. Yet would you stop taking a plane the next time you visit Delhi because of this fear?It's been statistically proven that you've got a higher chance of being run over while crossing the street than dying from a plane crash. Similarly all the statistics bandied about here has shown that, while death is certain in case of the 1/millionth dose you talked about the probability of that speck of Pu finding its way into your lung is much lower than much larger quantities of Co2 doing the same damage to your lung.So unless, as Guru Prabhu suggested (and got warned for it) we go back to a Vedic lifestyle where the fuel of choice is cowdung cakes, we have to take our chances. We can't pitch for a 9-10 per cent growth and then say we're too scared about nuclear power and much prefer dirty coal-fired power plants for high base load generation.It boils down to choices. But that choice should be made not in panic or paranoia but with informed opinion and discussion. As far as Fukushima, the concrete tomb and permanent evacuation zone point has been reached. They should get on with it rather than futzing around. There shouldn't be anymore workers walking around in there.I'm sorry but that stage has not been reached and is unlikely to be reached.

961,amit,30 Mar 2011 10:50 ,"The Guardian report quoting Richard Lahey was posted on the previous page.Even if we take the worst case scenario as speculated by him, Fukushima is no Chernobyl so comparisons with that is alarmist in nature.This is what he said:At least part of the molten core, which includes melted fuel rods and zirconium alloy cladding, seemed to have sunk through the steel ""lower head"" of the pressure vessel around reactor two, Lahey said.""The indications we have, from the reactor to radiation readings and the materials they are seeing, suggest that the core has melted through the bottom of the pressure vessel in unit two, and at least some of it is down on the floor of the drywell,"" Lahey said. ""I hope I am wrong, but that is certainly what the evidence is pointing towards.""  {A qualifying statement}The major concern when molten fuel breaches a containment vessel is that it reacts with the concrete floor of the drywell underneath, releasing radioactive gases into the surrounding area. At Fukushima, the drywell has been flooded with seawater, which will cool any molten fuel that escapes from the reactor and reduce the amount of radioactive gas released.Lahey said: ""It won't come out as one big glob; it'll come out like lava, and that is good because it's easier to cool.""The drywell is surrounded by a secondary steel-and-concrete structure designed to keep radioactive material from escaping into the environment. But an earlier hydrogen explosion at the reactor may have damaged this.""The reason we are concerned is that they are detecting water outside the containment area that is highly radioactive and it can only have come from the reactor core,"" Lahey added. ""It's not going to be anything like Chernobyl, where it went up with a big fire and steam explosion, but it's not going to be good news for the environment."""

As far as I see it, our 3 stage cycle will use (and produce) plutonium. Our weapons are plutonium based. Various estimates of our plutonium stockpile abound from 100 kg to 500 kg.

974,Lalmohan,30 Mar 2011 11:48 ,"theo - i don't disagree with the need for scepticism, however i think it needs to be rational and not hysterical.  nuclear power has many dangers, but so do other forms of power generation.  i am sure that when we have fusion power plants, they will have highly dangerous plasma torus' etc., which will come with their own fears.  sure there is plenty of potential for solar and other forms of power, but at the moment - the technology to extract them economically is not mature.  whilst we should continue with research into those fields, we cannot just abandon the nuclear genie - it is out of the bottle - and it must be tamed.given the sheer scale of devastation of the quake and tsunami i find the containment of the crisis at fukushima to be admirable.  no one here is under any illusion about how dangerous a situation it is, however we need to really understand what is going on rather than go off at random tangents and blather incoherentlyshould india invest in nuclear energy - my vote - yesis it safe? not enough - more work needs to be donebut that is true for almost every scientific and engineering endeavour"

The ratio of the concentrations of plutonium-238 and plutonium-239/240 in two of the samples indicate that very small amounts of plutonium might have been released during the Fukushima accident, but this requires to be further clarified.As far as food contamination is concerned, 63 samples taken from 24 - 29 March, and reported on from 27 - 29 March, for various vegetables, fruit (strawberries), mushrooms, eggs, seafood and pasteurized milk in eight prefectures (Chiba, Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Niigata, Tochigi and Yamagata), stated that results for iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137 were either not detected or were below the regulation values set by the Japanese authorities. First analyses were reported in fish carried out by the National Research Institute of Fishery Research. 5 samples of fish were collected from the port of Choshi (Chiba prefecture) and 4 of 5 samples showed Cs-137 concentrations below limit of detection. In one sample Cs-137 was found with 3 Bq/kg (fresh weight) and it was reported that it was slightly above the limit of detection. This concentration is far below any concern for fish consumption. The other thing about the IAEA updates - these are extremely professional in tenor, dont underplay or overplay the threat, and stick to the facts...If anything, partial to being cautious - mark the opening line...No subjective ""opinion"" expressed."

985,Theo_Fidel,30 Mar 2011 12:29 ,The thing to remember about Fukushima is that the Tsunami only exposed a weakness in the plant design. The weakness was always there.I don't understand why the comparison with other technologies is being brought up. Nuclear is a beast on its own. No other energy disaster will last as long or kill as silently as nuclear does. Despite the coal fire you can walk thru Jharia. This would not be true of a nuclear accident. And coal is resisted as well. Lets take a look at contribution. Nuclear in India only produces 4000 MW. This is just 2% of our capacity at present. Is the risk worth it. Even on poor days wind already exceeds it. While we think Nuclear is base load it is anything but.. plants often go offline for 6 months at a time. The Kalpakkam reactor for instance have been derated for a long time due to technical issues. The plants start and shut down all the time. We still have the option of not going down this road. Even Japan with 60+ reactors only gets ~ 25% of it power from nuclear. Only France has been able to depend substantially on Nuclear. Even our long term plan to 2030 will only call for < 10% of power to be Nuclear. Is it worth the risk?Also we too do not have a proper long term waste disposal system. The present plant is to mix it with molten glass and bury it underground in Kalpakkam. Nice. Kalpakkam has already been struck by a Tsunami and survived by the skin of its teeth. We should consider moving it and Koodankulam. Maybe not right now. But in the medium term. Say build a plant inland and then shut these down.Anyway this is getting a little OT so I'll leave it there.

Same type for calculation may keep you in the right ball park while consuming tainted food. Cigarettes, for example, if you looked at bed value, would be about 100-200 mSV/year (mainly from Rn in smoke) - so 5 or 10 years of smoking will get around 1000mSV. Madarssa maths only.Could be wrong. Some catch has to be there .""wrong"" is not the word I would use. Pauli had a word for it. The simple response could have been to work out the exact accumulated dose, as per expert calculation  based on the radiation rate indicated for  the place 65 km away from the plant,opposed to the calculation posited in my post  was so obvious since no one can survive that kind of exposure. One failed to notice FWIW, one is so fond of, and rest of the caveat.That's a great way to communicate the  goodness of radiation especially when one is a 'great' teacher.Expert talks would get one this far and no further. There are several other issues to be considered besides radiation , doses.Radiation doses and death statistics are not the great way to convey human tragedy  that is unfolding.If one feels that my posts raise panic then they should read all my posts and come to that conclusion and also understand what my position is on this.I am yet to see any worthwhile post to change my views.

This will take place in next 5-20 years time-frame.  - The majority of deaths at Chernobyl were fire-fighters and NPP workers. The next big group was those who kept drinking stuff like local milk from cows grazing Iodine  laced grass. Later cleanup of Chernobyl and the site caused virtually zero fatalities.  (100's of thousands took part in cleaning the area) - At Chernobyl about a 1000 ton of (radioactive) stuff spewed out.

However, the math shows that only up to 2 million people can be killed by inhaling plutonium. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. [94]Several populations of people who have been exposed to plutonium dust .... have been carefully followed and analyzed.These studies generally do not show especially high plutonium toxicity or plutonium-induced cancer results.[89] ""There were about 25 workers from Los Alamos National Laboratory who inhaled a considerable amount of plutonium dust during the 1940's; according to the hot-particle theory, each of them has a 99.5% chance of being dead from lung cancer by now {50-60 year} , but there has not been a single lung cancer among them.""[95][96]Plutonium has a metallic taste.[97 {How do they know?} "

In the 1970s and 1980s, Dr. Cohen worked tirelessly to refute the exaggerated claims of critics, both through careful research and through popular articles. He also had a flair for the dramatic. On “The Tonight Show” he offered to eat as much plutonium on camera as Ralph Nader would eat caffeine. Nader never took the challenge.A recipient of the Tom Bonner Prize from the American Physical Society, the Walter Zinn Award from the American Nuclear Society, the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award from the Health Physics Society, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering, he is still active in promoting the need for nuclear power, sitting on the advisory board of the U.S. ........

These trace amounts are in roughly the same quantities as the amounts left behind by nearby nuclear weapons tests, and are not considered a threat to human health, according to JAIF. Only two of the sites are believed to contain plutonium originating in the troubled reactors, with the rest being the result of the nuclear weapons tests. It is not known from which reactor the observed plutonium might have come, or how it was deposited in the soil. A companion post will discuss this, and the health effects of plutonium.Water AccumulationsContaminated water has accumulated in the basements and turbine rooms of units 1-3, and the basement of unit 4. Efforts are underway to clean up and store this water, preventing it from entering the environment, and allowing crews to continue servicing the electrical connections in the basement of each reactor.Each reactor building additionally has a trench outside it which is concrete-encased, and holds cables and piping for its associated reactor. The trenches outside units 1-4 have flooded with contaminated water. The trenches do not flow to the ocean, and are currently being sandbagged so that they do not overflow and carry radionuclides elsewhere.  TEPCO has released a nuclide analysis of trench 1 (http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-co ... 0330e2.pdf) which shows that the trench contains low levels of fission products, and no uranium or plutonium.  Dose rates at the surface of this trench are around 0.4 milliSievert per hour. Dose rates at Unit 2’s trench are high, at 1000 milliSieverts per hour. This high dose rate indicates that the water has been in contact with molten fuel for some time. The pathway through which this water made it to the trench is not known at this time. { This is most likely will not be hard to know - my comments}Measurements have been taken of seawater 30 km from the facility, and have indicated that only fission products, in small quantities, have made their way to the sea. These quantities, in amounts shown here (http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-co ... 0330e7.pdf) are far too low to impact human health. Fish from the region have been tested, and a have shown levels of Cs-137 at or just above the level of detection. These levels are below those of concern for fish consumption. <snip> "

Which is a terrible option long term on its own. Though they are really solid waste landfills and cant really handle liquids and wet waste. The liquids will likely end up in the ocean, similar to Russian practice. Japan does not have a High Level waste site though discussions have taken place.There is no easy way to reprocess low level waste. High level waste can be reprocessed at a staggering cost. The Japanese reprocessing facility has cost $20 Billion+, is still not fully operational and can only process 600 tons or so annually. Japan adds more than this to its waste stockpile so they will stay behind the curve until they build more facilities for even more cost. The US operators have simply refused to build a reprocessing facility as virgin Uranium is so cheap. Several attempts to force them to do so by environmental groups have failed due to the cost. It is far far far cheaper to just store the waste in water pools indefinitely. This bad faith is part of the reason Nevada so overwhelmingly opposes Yucca. Also keep in mind that reprocessing generates staggering amounts of low level wastes. Even more liquids as well which also get dumped in the environment.Long term a concrete tomb will be required, if only to prevent the elements from gradually seeping in and widening the pollution.

Might also help in containg radioactive waste problems or defunct nuclear power plants ( 15 such NPP are reported off limits  to humans and closed off in USA alone and many more are reaching the end of life  and /speculation/ likely to be decommissioned  in view of Fukushima /end speculation/)The government will likely go ahead with a plan to spray resin inside the troubled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, which it hopes will contain the spread of radioactive substances, sources said Wednesday.The government has begun full-fledged discussions on different plans to stop the spread of radioactive substances that have been leaking continuously from damaged reactors at the plant run by Tokyo Electric Power Co.In addition to efforts to cool the reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools by TEPCO and the Self-Defense Forces, the government has asked for aid from private companies and other nations, including the United States, to deal with the accident.It is believed spraying resin would minimize the spread of radioactive substances, which would allow repair work at the plant to proceed more smoothly, the sources said. Efforts to restore the reactors' cooling functions have seesawed repeatedly, with the detection Wednesday of radioactive iodine-131 at levels 3,355 times the legal limit in seawater near the plant being the latest wrench in the works.Spraying resin on debris inside the plant could begin as early as Thursday, the government sources said. The operation would last for about two weeks, they said.The plan involves using a remote-controlled robot to spray resin over about 80,000 square meters inside the 120,000-square-meter facility. The areas to be sprayed were contaminated by radiation from debris scattered by several hydrogen gas explosions in the days after the March 11 earthquake.Synthetic resin would likely be used, possibly Kurita Water Industries Ltd.'s Kuricoat C-720 Green. The product is usually used to prevent dust and sand from being blown off reclaimed and developed land. Coating the debris with resin is expected to prevent the radioactive materials from spreading into the air.The government had considered spraying resin from a helicopter, but about 3,000 flights would be necessary because only a limited amount could be sprayed each time. Since this method could also put helicopter crews in danger, the government rejected this option.To address the about 25,000 square meters of buildings thought to be contaminated, such as those housing the reactors, some general contractors have proposed covering the structures with tents, covering the walls with sheets and other plans. But these plans could take months to complete, the sources said.The government is also studying the possibility of using helicopters to spray other chemicals that could prevent the dispersal of radioactive substances.Meanwhile, highly radioactive water in the basements of turbine buildings remains a big problem.The Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry said it had considered dispatching port-use tankers to collect the contaminated water and then shuttle it via Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels to tankers anchored offshore. But the Defense Ministry deemed the plan too risky.""We don't have the ability to completely isolate the radiation-contaminated water, so that would've put SDF personnel at too much risk,"" a ministry official said.The government is now considering building temporary facilities for storing the contaminated water inside the plant and other options.<snip>The measures, however, are only stopgap, and the government said it would come up with more permanent solutions to contain the radioactive materials after temperatures in the nuclear fuel rod pools fall and the reactors stabilize.""We have to end the crisis at the nuclear plant, minimize radioactive contamination of surrounding areas and prevent any health damage,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said at a press conference Wednesday.

However, there is charm associated with high tech nuclear power. That is one of the reasons why reasonable people loose perspective and indulge in fear mongering when they want to make a case for nuclear power, say that India would go back to stone age without nuclear power.  That also doesn't help.While the systems that use energy are largely agnostic to the source of the energy, per se.  It doesn't matter that if the 2% of energy that is supplied by nuclear power is replaced by other sources, it is not going to be an automatic decline towards stone age.  That small percentage can easily be taken up other sources.  Ipunwa will still function if the battery gets charged due to energy from non nuclear source.  So no need to worry about transported back to vedic age on that account.Realistic assessment: without fear mongering of India slipping into dark ages sans nuclear power needs to be undertaken.

Total costs could balloon in Fukushima Prefecture for measures to remove the damaged fuel rods and contain the radioactivity.The TEPCO chairman also pledged to prepare, ""with sincerity,"" compensation to farmers and residents.Under the Law on Compensation for Nuclear Damage and contracts with utilities, the government will foot up to 120 billion yen per nuclear power plant in the event of a quake or tsunami.Beyond that amount, the utility is supposed to take an unlimited responsibility. If the company cannot cover all the bills, the government will be required to extend low-interest loans and subsidies.With the combined damage at the No. 1 and No. 2 plants in the prefecture, the compensation amount could be trillions of yen, a senior official of the Finance Ministry has said.TEPCO stock, which was traded around 2,000 yen before the quake struck, closed at 466 yen on Thursday.TEPCO appears reluctant to give up the remaining two reactors at the No. 1 plant and the four others at the No. 2 plant.Interestingly this news says unlimited responsibility ( not liability)  and Govt might be required to  extend low interest loans and subsidies."
1035,chaanakya,31 Mar 2011 20:16 ,"Anti-tsunami measures almost an afterthought at Fukushima plantThe catastrophic events that crippled the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant were mainly due to a tsunami that was off the charts.Nobody foresaw such towering tidal waves hitting with such force.But that was not the only factor. The problems were exacerbated by safety design for important equipment as well as inadequate emergency procedures, according to people associated with Tokyo Electric Power Co., the plant's operator.""There were problems with safety design of equipment at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant,"" said a nuclear engineer who once worked for TEPCO.A key design flaw, according to the engineer, centered on the location of vital pumping equipment used to bring in seawater to cool the reactor cores. The equipment was located near the coast.The tsunami triggered by the March 11 Great East Japan Earthquake wrecked both the equipment and its emergency generators. That led to a failure to pump in cooling water to the core.While the pumping equipment had a cover, it was ""almost totally exposed,"" according to the engineer.In comparison, the pumping equipment and emergency generators at the Fukushima No. 2 nuclear power plant, situated some 12 kilometers south of the Fukushima No. 1 plant, are installed within a roofed building, although they also lie by the ocean.A senior official in TEPCO's nuclear power division acknowledged that ""a major problem with the pumping equipment was that it was exposed, unlike the Fukushima No. 2 plant where it was installed within a building.""The engineer also referred to piping that is connected to turbine buildings at the No. 1 plant.""From the time of construction, there were many rough points in terms of safety as the piping was buried underground (without any covering),"" the engineer said.While improvements had been made over the years, such as covering the piping with concrete, the engineer said, ""There were sections where the work did not keep up, and the pumping equipment was one example of that.""The four reactors at the Fukushima No. 2 plant all automatically shut down as intended after the earthquake. While there were initial problems in the cooling system pumping in seawater, the cooling mechanism began operating through an external power source.By March 15, all four reactors had reached the cold shutdown stage, with core temperatures under 100 degrees.Slowness in responding to upgraded anti-quake guidelines also contributed to the extensive damage at the No. 1 plant.The difference is evident in a comparison with the Tokai No. 2 nuclear power plant operated by Japan Atomic Power Co. in Tokai, Ibaraki Prefecture.While the tsunami also battered the Tokai No. 2 plant, protective walls that were constructed after a review of anti-quake guidelines ensured that a power source was maintained.According to Japan Atomic Power officials, the Tokai No. 2 plant automatically shut down after the earthquake. Because its outside power source was lost, emergency diesel generators began operating to continue cooling the core.In the blink of an eye, a tsunami some 5 meters high smashed into the plant and flooded part of the complex.A seawater pump used for cooling purposes that relied on emergency generators was located on the northern side of the plant. It, too, was flooded and malfunctioned.However, the pump on the southern side of the plant was not flooded so the emergency generator continued operating, allowing for the cooling process to continue.When the anti-quake guidelines for nuclear power plants were reviewed in 2006, Japan Atomic Power factored in the possibility of a 5-meter tsunami striking the plant.To cope with such an eventuality, the company decided to construct side walls to cover the pumps that are connected to the emergency generators. The plant already had a protective wall against tsunami.Construction of the side walls was completed last September.Because related work on the northern side wall was not completed, the pump on that side was flooded. However, the southern side wall protected the pump on that side.TEPCO conducted safety checks of its various reactors after the anti-quake guidelines were updated, but the company's focus was on dealing with shaking from quakes rather than tsunami, according to sources.The process of implementing new measures was still continuing when the twin disasters struck, creating a third, and potentially more horrific, nuclear catastrophe.TEPCO's failure to consider that an outside power source would not be restored for a protracted period may have also compounded problems at the Fukushima No. 1 plant.When one of the reactors shut down, water began to be pumped into the core, according to TEPCO sources. But when the water reached a certain height, the supply was automatically turned off as is supposed to happen. This is because major problems can occur if the core is filled with water and it overflows into the turbine.However, the monstrous tsunami cut off the power source to the reactors, stopping the pumps and leading to a lengthy period when the reactor cores could not be cooled.When asked whether the reactor cores should have been immediately immersed in water, a mid-level TEPCO official said, ""I personally feel that should have been done.""The official said the decision was likely not taken because of a general sense that an outside power source would be restored within hours.There are procedures and training exercises to deal with a situation in which all outside power sources are lost.However, a TEPCO source said, ""In hindsight, (the function to protect the turbine) had a negative effect.""The mid-level official said: ""In the few minutes (until the tsunami hit), there may have been someone who thought, 'Bring the water level up to totally cover the core.' But I don't know if anyone would have made the decision to go ahead with that move.""Experts blamed TEPCO for not taking measures sooner.Keiji Miyazaki, professor emeritus of nuclear reactor engineering at Osaka University, said the failure to immerse the cores in water immediately after the earthquake was evidence of a lack of foresight.""If the cores had been flooded with water, damage to the fuel rods might have been avoided,"" Miyazaki said. ""Another question is why the valves to release pressure from the pressure container and containment vessel were not opened immediately.""Kiyoshi Sakurai, a commentator on technology issues, pointed to a number of safety problems at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.""No careful design was conducted for the pumping equipment or emergency generators,"" Sakurai said. ""Placing the emergency diesel generator in the basement of the turbine building was a mistake because the building has lower anti-quake standards than the building housing the reactor core."""

The 10 reactors of the quake-hit Fukushima Daiichi and Daini nuclear power plants of Tokyo Electric Power Co are not counted in the 44.Before the quake, the 54 commercial nuclear reactors were supplying around 30 percent of the total electricity generated in the country.Kaieda said that he does not expect the emergency steps to require suspension of currently operating reactors, but noted that plant operators will have to clear the safety standards to restart reactors after their regular checkups."

That's one way to skin the cat.The other way is to see the competition for that 10% huge number with the projected rate for say year 2030 for nuclear route is strong.  The justification for investing how much of that 10% should be nuclear versus non-conventional renewable route has to be made.  Easily, again the non-conventional renewables can give a running and substantially be two to three times more than nuclear route.The Life-time costing needs to be taken to ensure which yields maximum bang for the buck.  Not just the present running day costs.  Which means also accounting costs involved in actively managing spent fuel in backyard of the uber-rationalist mu. karunanidhi's home, since the risk factor from that is less than crossing a street from statistics.While at it nuclear risk insurance will possibly come cheap for the operators, because risk factor is minimal, so they can tide over a situation in such unlikely event as union carbide's bhopal gas tragedy. This time probably, the industry does it correctly to cover the actual costs, so that Indians are not as shoddily treated as in bhopal case.  After factoring in all the costs involved in doing the business a comparison can be done.Dependence on foreign source for fuel supply is one big damper on nuclear route.  That also needs to be factored in.Once all this is done, then one can see how much of that 10% new projected power capacity needs to be invested through nuclear and non-nuclear routes.all that said, nuclear is here, we have to learn how to better manage it rather than ignore itYes, after factoring in all the true cost benefit analysis, one will arrive how to better manage it so nuclear route is a good way to invest in certain Percentage of total energy requirements.

1053,Amber G.,01 Apr 2011 02:27 ,"Virtually every one  I know in academic circle agrees that MSM's  radiation related danger  is irresponsibly exaggerated.  Yet almost every media and their experts are  still   reporting error prone and some times out-right silly statements.(yes it is serious but one has to  consider backdrop of Earth quake etc)Reasonable analysis : From New Scientist Below:Risk expert: Why radiation fears are often exaggeratedWhat is it about nuclear energy that makes people particularly fearful?There has been a lot of research on this. Nuclear radiation ticks all the boxes for increasing the fear factor. It is invisible, an unknowable quantity. People don't feel in control of it, and they don't understand it. They feel it is imposed upon them and that it is unnatural. It has the dread quality of causing cancer and birth defects.Nuclear power has been staggeringly safe, but that doesn't stop people being anxious about it, just as airplanes and trains are an amazingly safe way to travel but people still worry far more about plane crashes than car crashes.People are calling the release of radiation from the Fukushima nuclear power station in Japan a ""catastrophe"". Is this justified?This is indeed a really serious event, but it has to be put in the context of the earthquake and tsunami which led to it - and which has been the direct cause of massive suffering, which is still continuing. Obviously there are threats from the nuclear power station, but they are limited and they are quantifiable. It's not a Chernobyl. Though the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl was a terrible event for many people, the lasting effects were nothing like as bad as expected.Many governments are suspending their nuclear power projects in response to the events in Japan. Is it sensible to make these decisions in the aftermath of a disaster?This is a tricky one. The Fukushima power station was hit by an unimaginable force. One is always surprised by these events, but one of the things you learn when you study risk is that surprising things happen. We have to expect the unexpected.Of course, political decisions are made on the basis of how people feel. That's a politician's job perhaps, not just to respond to objective measurements of risk but to what people want. But it's good to try and keep a perspective on what the risks are for all viable alternatives, including the risk of relying on unsavoury regimes for our sources of energy.Does this mean that fear itself is part of the problem?One of the biggest risks from radiation is the psychological damage it causes. After events like the 1979 partial meltdown at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, and the Chernobyl accident, there was substantial psychological trauma, even among people who were not affected, because there is such a fear of radiation and its long-term consequences.Would you be happy to live next to a nuclear power station?I have been trying to think how I would feel if I were in Japan right now. Would I be rushing out of Tokyo or not? I would love to say that I would be a plucky Brit and sit there with my stiff upper lip. But it is very difficult to know how you would react, especially as people respond to the feelings of those around them. But yes, I would be happy to live next to a nuclear power station, if only they weren't such big ugly things.Can I request Shiv (or others) to start a poll on some of these items here?"

The pool held the entire complement of fuel rods from the reactor's core, which had been emptied 3 months before the 11 March earthquake and tsunami struck. And yet on 15 March the building exploded, apparently fueled by hydrogen, leaving nuclear engineers to speculate about the source. Adding to the confusion are reports of fires in the pool, a worst-case scenario that had never before occurred in a working nuclear plant.Unraveling the mysteries surrounding the #4 pool will require discovering why water levels there fell so quickly, and whether the 230 tons of spent nuclear fuel melted in addition to catching on fire. Researchers also need to quantify how much radioactive material might have been released. The events at the #4 pool could shed light on the dangers posed by spent fuel in pools at more than 350 reactors globally, and what needs to be done to assure the public that they can be operated safely.As Science went to press, extremely high levels of radiation were hampering efforts to restore power and water lines to all six reactors at the complex. And while a possibly damaged core in reactor #3 was leaking highly radioactive water, reactor #4's pool remains among the biggest potential sources of radiation. In video released early this week, what appeared to be steam continued to billow from reactor #4's blown-out frame despite continued efforts to add water.Hot fuelThe nuclear fuel at reactor #4 is made up of uranium pellets held in 4-meter-long tubes made of zirconium alloy. The pool holds 1331 bundles of tubes, known as assemblies; 548 were removed from the reactor in January during maintenance.Daiichi has seven spent nuclear fuel pools: one for each of its six reactors, and a central one. They serve two main purposes: to cool the fuel, which gives off heat as a result of radioactive decay, and to shield workers and the environment from radiation. In reactors with Fukushima Daiichi's design, pools are not in sealed containment vessels but are open and accessible; operators are keenly aware of the importance of keeping water levels high. (Although the pool at reactor #3 may also have produced hydrogen, the other five pools have required constant replenishment but remained stable.)One mystery about the #4 pool is how its water level fell so quickly. During normal operation, 7 meters of roughly 40°C water sit between the top of the fuel rods and the surface of the 1425-ton pool. The water is constantly circulated and replenished. There's little doubt that temperatures in the pool would have risen steadily after power was lost. But several scientists have independently calculated that it would take much longer than 4 days—perhaps as much as 3 weeks—for the heat of the fresh fuel in the #4 pool to evaporate or boil off the water.Could the #4 pool's structure have been damaged in the quake or subsequent explosions or both? Among possible weak points are the large doors on the side of the pool. The doors, which allow fuel to pass underwater from the reactor into the pool, are held shut by rubber gaskets inflated by electric pumps. In 1986, at the Hatch nuclear plant near Baxley, Georgia, the water level in a spent fuel pool dropped by more than a meter after the seals were left uninflated. But engineers say that the channel between the reactor and the pool is filled with water during maintenance periods, meaning that a leak would lengthen the time it took to empty the pool. “It's surprising to me [that] the fuel became uncovered that quickly,” says Lake Barrett, a retired nuclear engineer and former U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) official.Determining the temperature of the pool has been another challenge. (It was reported to be 84°C the day before the explosion; no data have been subsequently released.) Knowing that temperatures were high enough to drive water completely from the pool could help researchers quantify how much radioactivity was released in subsequent steps. The day after the 15 March explosion, NRC Chair Gregory Jaczko said that the pool had run dry at one point, a claim that the Japanese government has disputed.At least one fire in the pool—and possibly a second—was reported by power company officials after the explosion. Lab experiments have shown that zirconium can burn either with steam or with oxygen. Both reactions progress rapidly at roughly 800°C; the former, crucially, releases hydrogen. The hydrogen explosion at reactor #4 points to the steam reaction, which releases less energy and therefore melts the fuel more slowly. But knowing which reaction dominated could help scientists quantify how much radioactivity was released from pool #4. A 2006 study by the U.S. National Research Council said that a heat up after a loss-of-water event could melt the spent fuel, allowing the escape of volatile radionuclides, including “a substantial fraction of the cesium,” into the air.Soil samples analyzed by the Japanese science ministry last week found cesium levels roughly equivalent to 8 million becquerels per square meter near the plant. That level, if accurate, would be higher than those found near Chernobyl. (Radioactive iodine has been found in Japanese tap water, but its 8-day half-life means that it couldn't have come from the older spent fuel in pool #4. Reactor #3 may be the source.) Scientists also don't know what fraction of the radioactive cesium released is from reactors or from spent fuel. Scientists hope more detailed isotopic measurements will shed light on the age and, therefore, the source of the radioactive particles.Minding the poolsSome experts believe that governments and the nuclear power industry have done a poor job of sharing information on the risk of zirconium fires. Critics of NRC say that studies conducted for the agency likely contain relevant data but have been kept classified to keep the information away from terrorists. “To the extent that any experiments have been done at all, the public doesn't know about them,” says spent-fuel expert Gordon Thompson of Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. The National Research Council study called on NRC to “improve the sharing of pertinent information” on pool risks.The calamity at Fukushima Daiichi has raised particular concerns about U.S. spent nuclear fuel pools, which are thought to be packed more tightly than those in Europe or Asia. “Spent nuclear fuel may be more vulnerable than we thought,” says Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C. The nuclear industry has added additional sprayers to pools and now mixes hot, fresh spent fuel with older fuel in the pools to redistribute the heat. But it balked at a 2008 recommendation by Jaczko—speaking in an unofficial capacity—to transfer U.S. fuel older than 5 years to dry concrete casks, where the cooled fuel is highly unlikely to catch fire. Still, the industry has begun a safety review of U.S. reactors, and NRC has launched two studies into U.S. plant safety that could lead to new rules on spent fuel. "
1058,abhishek_sharma,01 Apr 2011 07:59 ,"JAPAN DISASTER: Scientific Consensus on Great Quake Came Too Latehttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/22.fullTen years ago, Koji Minoura, a geologist at Tohoku University in Sendai, and colleagues injected some science into a legendary disaster. A historical document compiled in 901 C.E. told of an earthquake in 869 C.E. that destroyed a castle town in northeastern Japan and a subsequent tsunami that inundated the surrounding area, killing 1000. Digging in rice paddies in what is now called the Sendai Plain, Minoura's team found telltale marine sediments showing that the tsunami ran as much as 4 kilometers inland. They estimated the Jogan earthquake's magnitude at 8.3 and concluded that it could recur at 1000-year intervals. “The possibility of a large tsunami striking the Sendai Plain is high,” they wrote in a 2001 article in the Journal of Natural Disaster Science.That obscure paper is now at the center of a growing debate about how quickly scientific findings can and should influence disaster-mitigation policies. A few years before the magnitude-9.0 Tohoku earthquake struck northeastern Japan on 11 March, a scientific consensus had begun to coalesce around the idea that a Jogan-like event could happen again. But that consensus did not influence seismic risk assessments, tsunami preparedness, or a review of the hardiness of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.“It's necessary to communicate research findings to society,” says Yukinobu Okamura, a geologist at the Active Fault and Earthquake Research Center in Tsukuba, who led studies that independently bolstered Minoura's findings. “We tried to do that in this case, but we weren't in time.”One lesson is that incorporating geological studies of ancient earthquakes and tsunamis into risk assessments “is essential to compensate for the limitations in the current evaluation scheme,” says Fumihiko Imamura, a tsunami engineer at Tohoku University in Sendai.The need to revise earthquake probability analyses extends far beyond Japan. “There are other subduction zones, near Java and New Zealand, where people think there is no chance of a big quake” because they cling to old models of seismic processes, says Robert McCaffrey, a geophysicist at Portland State University in Oregon. But forecasts are generally based on studies covering the past several centuries—“not long enough for the cycle time for these big earthquakes,” he says.Although scientists have been interrogating geologic deposits for clues to the size and frequency of major earthquakes for several decades, efforts to apply such techniques to ancient tsunamis are more recent. In the early 1990s, “many people didn't believe tsunamis left deposits,” says Joanne Bourgeois, a tsunami geologist at the University of Washington, Seattle. Minoura was among the paleo tsunami pioneers when he started digging in the Sendai Plain. Recent sediment surveys have supported his Jogan findings, while studies of accumulating crustal strain in the Sendai area hinted at the possibility of a major earthquake. Even so, before the 11 March quake some scientists “did not believe” the region was primed for a big earthquake, says Yuichiro Tanioka, a seismologist at Hokkaido University in Sapporo.Planners and engineers began to recognize the significance of geologic research for earthquake preparedness in the late 1970s, after paleoseismic studies revealed the regular recurrence of earthquakes along the San Andreas fault in California. But paleo studies didn't directly influence public policy until the mid-1990s. An early example is the Cascadia earthquake, now known to have occurred in the subduction zone off North America's Pacific Coast in 1700. In 1986, researchers reported the first geological evidence for this massive event: a sudden drop in elevation of coastal regions, inferred from sedimentary deposits, a sign of slippage on the upper side of a subduction zone. Eight years later, a revision to the Uniform Building Code required buildings in western Washington and Oregon to be 50% more earthquake-resistant. Then in 1995, partly because of the Pacific threat, the U.S. Congress passed the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program, which supports studies of tsunami risk and emergency planning.The size and timing of the Cascadia earthquake were unclear. Those pieces of the puzzle turned up in Japan, where Kenji Satake, a seismologist now at University of Tokyo, and colleagues found Japanese accounts of a tsunami without an apparent local cause. In Nature in 1996, they pinpointed the date of the Cascadia earthquake as 26 January 1700 and estimated a magnitude of 9.0. “There is a lot of respect for [Japan's] record-keeping diligence,” says Brian Atwater, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist at the University of Washington, Seattle.Japan's Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion produces seismic hazard maps for the nation; they are used to estimate potential tsunamis. The headquarters incorporates paleoseismic studies in determining earthquake risk—but only in Hokkaido, Tanioka says. Hokkaido was the last region of modern Japan settled by ethnic Japanese, and reliable records go back only to the mid-1800s, he says. Elsewhere, the agency relies on “documents allowing the estimation of earthquake frequency and scale [going] back 400 years,” Imamura says. Using those records, the earthquake research headquarters warned that the area hit by the 11 March temblor faced a 99% probability of a magnitude-7.5 earthquake occurring in the next 30 years.Okamura and colleagues conducted more extensive surveys in the Sendai area in the mid-2000s that bolstered Minoura's original findings. According to Okamura, the earthquake research headquarters was studying whether and how to include Jogan in its risk assessment for the Tohoku region. “But the earthquake occurred before the evaluation was completed,” he says.Any upward revision is now also too late for the Fukushima plant. The first reactor was completed in 1971, long before the Jogan event appeared on the scientific radar. Planners girded for a maximum 5.7-meter tsunami; Tokyo Electric Power Co. estimates that the tsunami that took out the backup diesel generators was 14 meters high. The company missed a chance to address the deficiency when an expert panel reviewed the plant's seismic resistance in 2008. As The Washington Post reported, Okamura told the panel about the Jogan earthquake and warned that a bigger tsunami was possible. The panel, concerned mostly about earthquake shaking, brushed aside his concerns, he asserts.Japan and other countries will surely rethink tsunami threats—just as Minoura intends to do. Originally, he says, he tried to “simply make clear the geological process of coastal environments.” But now, “I want to meditate deeply on the future of geological work [related to] tsunamis,” he says. The Tohoku temblor should convince the scientific community and authorities that magnitude-9 earthquakes can occur anywhere along subduction zones, McCaffrey says. Like a tsunami, the effects of the 11 March Tohoku earthquake will spread far and wide. "
1059,abhishek_sharma,01 Apr 2011 08:06 ,"Concerns over nuclear energy are legitimatehttp://www.nature.com/news/2011/110330/full/471549a.htmlThe unique and almost existential nature of the risk posed by nuclear power has had ample airing over the past three weeks, since the disaster at the Fukushima plant in Japan. Enthusiasm for a global nuclear revival has stalled — and not before time.The scientific community could yet play a valuable part in the management of this crisis. It could help put events in perspective, and begin the process of drawing out useful regulatory and other lessons. In the United States, this has already begun, with specific suggestions for change coming from former US government science advisers Frank von Hippel and Matthew Bunn. Last week on this page, Charles Ferguson, president of the Federation of American Scientists, did likewise (see C. D. Ferguson Nature 471, 411; 2011).Less edifying have been the nuclear experts who have popped up in the media to 'inform' the public about the crisis. Individually, their motives may be honourable, but the collective impression has been unconvincing: defensive, selective, condescending towards public fears and, in my view, ultimately counterproductive. Their combined message seems to have been: don't worry, things are under control, and Fukushima is not Chernobyl.Well, Fukushima is certainly not Chernobyl, but some salient points about what Fukushima actually is, I would argue, deserve wider attention. All are relevant to the future deployment of nuclear power.“The risk of nuclear power is that active human intervention has to be maintained.”One is that Fukushima houses six reactors on one site, despite the fact that even the most basic analysis of failure modes and effects would come out resoundingly against such an arrangement. Not only are all the reactors exposed simultaneously to the same dangers — whether flood, earthquake, war or terrorist attack — but radiation release at one reactor or fuel tank could cripple recovery efforts at the others. Everyone in nuclear engineering knows this. Yet such co-siting is the central organizing principle of current nuclear-build plans in Britain, the United States and elsewhere, because the only communities that will accept new nuclear plants are those that already have them.The second is an inherent problem with light-water reactors, including boiling-water reactors, as at Fukushima, and pressurized-water reactors (PWRs). These designs are compact and relatively inexpensive, but their potential for meltdown was once obvious enough that Britain spent 30 years trying to develop gas-cooled alternatives. But, now that PWRs are the only viable design for new nuclear build, that extensive search for a safer design seems to have been forgotten by many of those who promote a nuclear future.A third point is the storage of spent fuel rods in pools of water at power plants. The amount of fuel held in this way continues to grow relentlessly, particularly in the United States, where the Obama administration's shelving of the Yucca Mountain waste-storage project in Nevada leaves the fuel with nowhere else to go. As in the United Kingdom, such 'interim' storage is the only likely destination for spent fuel from new reactors, ahead of promised deep disposal in an uncosted, unscheduled and uncertain underground repository.These legitimate technical criticisms of Fukushima, and of planned nuclear build, have been largely drowned out by the flood of technical reassurance offered by nuclear scientists and engineers in the wake of the disaster. For example, reassuring soundbites offered to journalists by the London-based Science Media Centre (which is funded by a variety of scientific bodies and industries, including Nature Publishing Group) in the days immediately after the earthquake contained barely a cautionary note on how serious the situation at Fukushima was set to become. Instead, the scientific establishment and those whose careers are invested in nuclear power have sought to convince the public that 'science' supports nuclear power. Too many specialists have assured us of the general safety of nuclear power without adequately addressing specific concerns.Some of this loyalty is deep rooted, I fear, in the development of the atomic bomb, which greatly embellished the standing of the scientific establishment with governments. Not long afterwards, many senior physicists embraced 'atoms for peace'. Having interrogated nature, and established the means to harness some of its terrible powers, they wanted to prove themselves 'useful'. Such a culture influences those who follow — and can take generations to wear off.Costing and planning of new nuclear power stations will now be carried out in the light of three data points: Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. In each case, excuses are readily made by supporters of nuclear power. For Three Mile Island, they were that radiation releases were minimal, and that a supposedly unsophisticated American public confused the accident with the plot of The China Syndrome. Communist incompetence, we are told, contributed to Chernobyl being as bad as it was. The race is now on to find a narrative that explains away the ugly reality of the Fukushima disaster. The alleged uniqueness of the earthquake and tsunami event is already emerging as the front runner.Yet the real risk of nuclear power is that active human intervention has to be maintained, come rain, shine, war or political upheaval. That, and the threat of a downside too terrible to contemplate. Colin Macilwain is a contributing correspondent with Nature. "
1060,abhishek_sharma,01 Apr 2011 08:07 ,"Lessons from the pastThe Chernobyl disaster still has much to tell us about the long-term risks of low-level radiation exposure. But only if the necessary follow-up studies are supported.http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v471/n7340/full/471547a.htmlAs the battle to make safe the Fukushima nuclear reactors continues, the political fallout is spreading across Japan and around the world. Despite reassuring early reports, it is clear that significant amounts of radioisotopes have been released from the plant, and some workers there face severe radiation exposure as they try to cool the overheated nuclear fuel. In response, several governments are reviewing the safety and future of their own nuclear programmes. Fukushima has undoubtedly strengthened the hand of those who oppose nuclear power.The global reach of the disaster brought an echo from history last week when iodine-131 from Fukushima was detected in Ukraine — home to the Chernobyl power plant, site of the world's worst civilian nuclear disaster. A quarter of a century ago, a flawed safety test at Chernobyl triggered a massive explosion and fire that spread tonnes of radioactive material across Europe, and shredded public confidence in atomic energy.Like Fukushima, the consequences of Chernobyl were wide ranging. In the satellite countries, resentment of Soviet handling of the disaster contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union. Thousands of children developed thyroid cancer after drinking contaminated milk. Billions of crucial dollars from the economies of Ukraine and Belarus were redirected to remediation, health care and compensation. Every day, some 3,500 workers still labour at the plant to prevent further releases, while decommissioning of the site's four reactors has barely begun. Recovering from a nuclear disaster is the task of generations: it will be another 50 years before Chernobyl is just a memory.As we report on page 562, the pace of recovery at Chernobyl has been slowed by the reluctance of other countries to pay for it. The shattered reactor 4 still lies beneath a haphazard concrete sarcophagus, erected in the frantic months after the accident. Maintenance work keeps it secure — for now — but the walls are streaked with rust and its roof is in a poor state of repair. Engineers want to build a safe confinement arch to allow them to dismantle the reactor, at an estimated cost of US$1.4 billion.“Recovering from a nuclear disaster is the task of generations.”The Chernobyl Shelter Fund, managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has so far amassed more than $800 million of that sum, from 30 donors. But funding shortfalls have delayed the project by years and the 2015 target for completion will be difficult to achieve without more money from the international community.One immediate consequence of the Fukushima disaster should be to encourage this money to flow. Nuclear accidents have global repercussions, and public mistrust of nuclear power demands that its problems not be left to fester. It is in the world's interest to push forward with safe nuclear power — but also to deal properly with its damaging legacy when things go wrong, as they will.Today, new nuclear power stations are being constructed in more than a dozen countries. China alone is working on almost half of the 65 reactors currently being built, and there is growing interest in the technology from developing countries. Supporters of the spread of civil nuclear power must acknowledge that some of these countries would be unable to cope alone if faced with a nuclear accident on the scale of Chernobyl.Nations, particularly those pushing new nuclear build, must invest in bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, to ensure that new and old reactors around the world are sufficiently safe, and that they are fully prepared for the worst. And politicians and the nuclear industry must revisit their relationship with a sceptical public. Being open and transparent about the uncertain costs of new build in countries such as the United Kingdom would be a start. If a public subsidy is required to get them built, then say so. If the industry wants people to believe its assurances that nuclear power is safe, then now is not the time for obfuscation and weasel words, on any aspect of the technology (see page 549).Governments must also work to present a clear narrative about the health implications of accidents such as Chernobyl and Fukushima. For heroic plant workers exposed to extreme radiation doses — and for those still suffering from Chernobyl's legacy of thyroid cancer — the risks are all too clear. But it is harder to pin down more subtle health effects. There are hints that low-level exposure can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and other conditions, consistent with the idea that there is no safe threshold for radiation exposure. To clarify the situation, the world needs studies of large numbers of people exposed to very low doses of radiation — and Chernobyl can provide those. Funding such research is vital for those affected by Chernobyl's radiation, but it should also answer some of the questions over the future of nuclear power.People legitimately ask whether the low levels of radioactivity now drifting across Japan are safe. The current best answer is 'probably'. A better response would be to find out, before another 25 years pass."
1061,abhishek_sharma,01 Apr 2011 08:10 ,"Radioactivity spreads in JapanFallout is localized, but could persist for years in some regions.http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110329/full/471555a.htmlIn a week that has seen little good news about the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors, the latest data on radioisotope fallout from the plant is so far offering a glimmer of hope.Monitoring efforts are showing that although the reactors have released significant amounts of radiation into the atmosphere, dangerous contamination is mostly localized in a narrow zone northwest of the plant. Emissions are also lower than immediately after the initial explosions, but radioisotope release continues and trends are unpredictable.Working through the details is going to take time, and experts are struggling to assess the situation. ""We don't have enough data yet, and what we have are still patchy,"" says Jim Smith, an environmental physicist at the University of Portsmouth, UK. In the meantime, the Japanese authorities are taking many of the right precautions, such as quickly implementing an evacuation zone, and banning farming and fishing in the areas worst affected, he says.It is already clear that Japan's geography has been crucial to reducing the accident's impact. Initial estimates suggest that Fukushima's reactors have emitted one-tenth of all the radioactive material released during the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, and prevailing winds have swept most of the radioactivity over the Pacific Ocean. Austria's Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics in Vienna estimated last week that although Fukushima's radioactive plume has now dispersed across the Northern Hemisphere, negligible levels of volatile radioisotopes such as iodine-131 and caesium-137 (the major components of the plume) have hit countries outside Japan. By contrast, radiation from land-locked Chernobyl spread across much of Europe (see page 562).Fukushima's plume is still being fed by continued emissions from its damaged reactors, but when these are halted and the plume dissipates, the long-term impact on Japan will depend on which radioisotopes have been deposited on the ground, and in what quantities. Concentrations of caesium-137, which has a half-life of 30 years, are particularly important in determining which areas will be off-limits for settlement or farming, and for how many years.On Sunday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that 16 of Japan's 47 prefectures showed daily deposition rates on the ground of less than 860 becquerels per square metre (Bq m−2) for iodine-131, and 100 Bq m−2 for caesium-137. The IAEA also reported that contamination has not increased in 28 of Japan's prefectures over the period 18–25 March. But higher contamination was recorded in Yamagata prefecture, immediately northwest of Fukushima prefecture: 7,500 Bq m−2 of iodine-131 and 1,200 Bq m−2 of caesium-137, which exceeds recommended contamination levels for growing green leafy vegetables. No data were available for Fukushima prefecture itself, where high contamination rates are expected.Those data are consistent with the results of aerial monitoring of ground radiation carried out by the US Department of Energy. A survey of the region on 22 March showed no increase in deposition of radioactivity compared with a previous survey on 17–19 March, despite the wind blowing inland from the plant for some of that time, suggesting that there had not been a significant additional dump of radioisotopes. The survey showed that the highest radioactivity doses on the ground (greater than 0.125 millisieverts per hour; mSv h−1) were restricted to a narrow band within 40 km of the plant, stretching to the northwest (see 'Fukushima's fallout'). No values anywhere exceeded 0.3 mSv h−1, a dose likely to cause adverse health effects in anyone continually exposed for a few months. Still, doses at some sites over the course of a year would top 1,000 mSv, enough to cause symptoms of radiation sickness, including nausea, hair loss and reduced white-blood-cell counts.Much of the 20-km evacuation zone around the plant had far lower dose levels, below 0.012 mSv h−1. Nevertheless, that corresponds to a potential annual dose of more than 100 mSv, more than five times the annual limit permitted for UK nuclear-industry workers. The patchy distribution of fallout reflects the role of wind patterns and rainfall in washing out radio­isotopes to the ground. Overall, Smith says he was ""relieved"" by the data, as they suggest that contamination around Fukushima will be much lower than that seen around Chernobyl.But some areas of high contamination seem to lie outside the exclusion zone. Soil samples taken on 20 March from a location 40 km northwest of the plant showed caesium-137 levels of 163,000 becquerels per kilogram (Bq kg−1) and iodine-131 levels of 1,170,000 Bq kg−1, according to Japan's science ministry. Acceptable contamination levels for areas used to grow crops are much lower, typically in the range of a few hundred Bq kg−1. ""If there are significant areas of caesium-137 soil concentration of the order of 100,000 Bq kg−1, evacuation of these areas could be effectively permanent,"" says Smith.Detailed maps of caesium-137 distribution would help to identify hotspots where people need to be evacuated urgently, he adds. An estimated 200,000 people have already been evacuated from Fukushima's 20-km zone, and on 25 March, the government encouraged people living in the 10-km radius beyond that to leave voluntarily.The dispersal of much of the radioactivity over the ocean clearly helped to prevent a worse situation inland, but it is bringing its own problems. Data released last week by Japan's science ministry showed high surface sea­water concentrations of 24.9–76.8 becquerels per litre (Bq l−1) of iodine-131, and 11.2–24.1 Bq l−1 of caesium-137 some 30 km offshore, although these levels seem to be decreasing. By contrast, the IAEA reported this week that radioactivity levels near the plant's discharge pipes were increasing, with 74,000 Bq l−1 of iodine-131 and 12,000 Bq l−1 of caesium-134 and caesium-137 combined. Recommended maximum coastal discharges from nuclear power plants are typically lower than 4,000 Bq l−1.As a result of the nuclear accident, Japan has banned all fishing within 20 km of the Fukushima plant. Seaweeds and other marine organisms can concentrate radioisotopes from the water, and it will be necessary to monitor their transport through the food chain, says Timothy Mousseau, a radioecologist at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. Smith adds: ""There has obviously been significant contamination of the marine system, although I would expect that the enormous dilution of the ocean would significantly limit potential doses and impacts.""On 27 March, a new threat arose from highly radioactive water flooding the basements of Fukushima's reactors, in some areas delivering a potentially lethal dose of 1,000 mSv h−1. The water is seeping into piping trenches less than 70 metres from the sea shore, raising the spectre of serious contamination of the sea and groundwater in the area. Yukio Edano, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, has promised a massive effort to prevent that from happening.As long as the reactors continue to release radioisotopes, the human and environmental toll from the Fukushima power plant can only grow. Once emissions are halted, atmospheric radiation levels will fall quickly, as will ground levels of short-lived isotopes. Iodine-131 is responsible for a large share of the total released radioactivity, for example, and has a half-life of just 8 days. But it may be many weeks, or months, before the power plant is tamed — and years before parts of northern Japan tainted by long-lived radioisotopes are habitable again.  "
1062,abhishek_sharma,01 Apr 2011 08:18 ,"Chernobyl's legacy: Twenty-five years after the nuclear disaster, the clean-up grinds on and health studies are faltering. Are there lessons for Japan?http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110328/full/471562a.htmlThe morning train from Slavutych is packed with commuters playing cards, browsing e-readers, or watching the monotonous flood plains pass by. It looks like any other routine journey to work. But rather than facing a crush through subway turnstiles at the end of the 40-minute trip, the workers are met by a row of full-body radiation monitors. It is the start of another day at the Chernobyl power plant, the site of the world's worst civilian nuclear disaster.As the train trundles through the bleak Ukrainian countryside, another nuclear crisis is unfolding halfway around the world. Barely a week after the partial meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, it is no surprise that some of the chatter on the train turns to the incident there. ""It looks bad,"" says one commuter. ""But not as bad as Chernobyl,"" he adds, with a hint of grim pride. When Chernobyl's reactor number 4 exploded in the early hours of 26 April 1986, the ensuing blaze spewed 6.7 tonnes of material from the core high into the atmosphere, spreading radioactive isotopes over more than 200,000 square kilometres of Europe (see 'The hottest zone'). Dozens of emergency workers died within months from radiation exposure and thousands of children in the region later developed thyroid cancer. The region around the plant became so contaminated that officials cordoned off a 30-kilometre exclusion zone that straddled Ukraine's border with Belarus. Today, a staff of about 3,500 enters the zone each day to monitor, clean and guard the site, where remediation work will continue for at least another 50 years (see 'Half-life of a disaster').So far, the Fukushima accident is less severe. Radiation levels measured near the Japanese power plant have been less than those at Chernobyl after the blast there (see Table 1). And although radiation has spread from Fukushima, it does not match the amounts that rained down in the region around Chernobyl.  ---------------------------------Table 1Dose (mSv)	                          Source/implicationUp to 5,000	          One minute’s exposure to Chernobyl core shortly after explosion1,000       	Causes temporary radiation sickness, including nausea and decreased white-blood-cell count250	 Upper annual limit allowed for Fukushima emergency workers120 	Average total dose received by liquidators at Chernobyl (1986–90)30	 Average total dose of external radiation received by evacuees from Chernobyl plant and surrounding area20	Average annual limit for nuclear-industry workers9	Total dose received by the 6 million residents in contaminated areas (>37 kBq m–2) in former USSR9	One computed-tomography (CT) scan9	Annual exposure of airline crew flying regularly between New York and Tokyo3	One mammogram2.4	Average annual background radiation globally0.3	Total dose received by each resident of Europe for 20 years after Chernobyl--------Despite those differences, the quarter-century of work following the Chernobyl disaster will offer some important lessons for Japan as the nation begins to assess the health and environmental consequences of Fukushima. The problems that followed Chernobyl also provide a grim reminder about the value of accurate information. Officials need to tell people immediately how to avoid the initial, most dangerous, exposure; yet in the longer term, scientists and the government must battle against unnecessary concern over low-level doses of radiation, which often causes more harm than the radiation itself.In some ways, the connection between the two accidents may yield the biggest benefits for Chernobyl. For a brief window of time, the world has again focused attention on the largely overlooked work there. The renewed interest may spur nations to chip in the cash needed to complete the clean-up of the site, and to carry out health studies that have languished for want of proper coordination and funding. ""In recent years, Chernobyl has been neglected by funding agencies and, to an extent, the scientific community,"" says Jim Smith, a radioecologist at the University of Portsmouth, UK, who has studied the consequences of the accident for 20 years. ""But there is still more to learn from Chernobyl about decommissioning and the effects of the radiation,"" says Smith, who is touring the site with a group of other scientists.After clearing a security checkpoint, the visiting researchers board a bus that heads towards the heart of the ageing power plant. They pass abandoned buildings and bump along potholed roads running beneath archways made of piping; since the accident, pipes have been laid above ground to avoid disturbing contaminated soil.The visitors stop to look at the most visible reminder of the accident, the concrete sarcophagus that entombs the shattered reactor building. Completed hastily in November 1986, the sarcophagus was built to contain the escaping radiation, but it is now crumbling and streaked with rust. Smith whips a dosimeter out of his rucksack and poses for a photograph in front of the sarcophagus. The reading is 5 µSv h−1: about 10 minutes of exposure at that level equals the same dose as an arm X-ray.The plant's bright main office is a stark contrast to the sarcophagus. Stained-glass windows depict — in glorious socialist–realist style — the harnessing of atomic energy. But the plant has not produced power since 2000, when the last reactor was shut down. Valeriy Seyda, a deputy director of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, explains that the plant's top priority now is to construct a new confinement shelter for reactor 4 before the sarcophagus becomes too unstable. If it collapses before the new shell is in place, it could throw up a cloud of radioactive particles and expose the deadly remnants of the reactor.Replacing the rusting tombThe plan is to build an enormous steel arch adjacent to the reactor and slide it along a runway to cover the building. The arch will reach 105 metres high, with a span of 257 metres — the world's largest mobile structure, according to its designers. It is expected to be in place by 2015 and should last for 100 years. It will enable robotic cranes inside to dismantle the sarcophagus and parts of the reactor. Long-term plans call for finishing the clean-up work at Chernobyl by 2065.Some of the concrete trenches for the project are in place. But the international Chernobyl Shelter Fund that supports the US$1.4-billion effort still lacks about half of that cash, and the completion date has slipped by almost ten years since the shelter plan was agreed in principle in 2001. One of the key goals of a forthcoming conference — Chernobyl, 25 Years On: Safety for the Future — to be held in Kiev on 20–22 April is to secure more cash commitments from international donors. Meanwhile, Chernobyl is developing long-term storage facilities for the debris that will be hacked out of reactor 4; and for more than 20,000 spent fuel canisters from the site's other reactors, a facility that will cost about €300 million (US$420 million).Although all those reactors have been shuttered, the plant continues to generate large amounts of radioactive waste — partly because of persistent flooding in some of the waste-storage buildings and reactor 4's turbine hall. Every month, at least 300,000 litres of radioactive water must be pumped out of the structures and stored on site.The main cause of this flooding is Chernobyl's brimming cooling pond, which artificially elevates groundwater levels in the area. Alexander Antropov, a Chernobyl veteran with ice-blue eyes and a cool manner to match, is in charge of a project to decommission the pond. The term 'cooling pond' usually refers to the containers where spent fuel rods are stored until their radiation dissipates enough that they can be put into long-term storage. But Chernobyl's pond is actually a vast reservoir covering 22 square kilometres into which water from the reactor cooling systems was discharged. The pond also contains long-lasting radioactive material such as caesium-137 and strontium-90, which rained down after the explosion. Besides causing flooding at the plant, the high water levels in the cooling pond raise the risk that a weak dyke along its east side will burst, which would send water coursing into the Pripyat River. Radioactivity in the escaping water would be quickly diluted by the river, so although it would not significantly raise exposure levels for people downstream, it could cause panic among the local population.Antropov says that his team cannot simply lower the water levels in the pond because they don't know what effect microscopic radio­active sediment particles would have if exposed. In the meantime, the team maintains the status quo by pumping water from the Pripyat River into the pond at a cost of a few hundred thousand euros per year. But the long-term plan is to lower the water level by 7 metres to form a patchwork of 10–20 smaller ponds that would keep the most dangerous sediments in place. The project would cost €3 million to €4 million, says Antropov. He is already in discussions with the relevant regulators and is optimistic that the necessary feasibility studies and environmental impact assessments can be completed.But the effort has been a long time coming. The decommissioning plan is more than a decade old, and was supported by a 2005 survey for the European Commission, led by Smith. Once again, money has been a key factor in the delay. The major parts of Chernobyl's decommissioning plan are paid for by international funds, but the cooling pond project is not. Nor is the research needed to satisfy the regulators. ""Most of our own activities come from the Ukrainian budget, and we are not a rich country,"" says Seyda.After leaving the cooling pond, the visitors stop at Pripyat, an abandoned town just 3 kilometres from the reactor complex. Some 44,000 residents were evacuated the day after the accident, and many of their belongings still litter the decaying buildings. Antropov once lived here — his daughter was a few months old at the time of the accident — and as deputy chief of the town's Communist party office, he was responsible for evacuating part of the town. Because he worked as a senior engineer at the nuclear plant, he knew that the disaster would have repercussions for decades to come. ""I understood that I would never return to live in Pripyat,"" he says, in an uncharacteristically soft voice. ""I still feel some sense of loss.""The evacuees from Pripyat also live with lingering fear about the radiation they were exposed to before fleeing their homes. Along with millions of others from the surrounding regions, they often attribute any sign of ill health to the accident. But pinning down Chernobyl's true public-health impact has proved remarkably difficult.There is little disagreement about the terrible fate of the workers who brought Chernobyl's stricken reactor under control. Of 134 emergency workers diagnosed with acute radiation sickness, 28 died from their exposure within four months. Another 19 have died since from various causes, and many of the surviving workers now have cataracts and skin injuries.More than 5,000 cases of thyroid cancer have so far been seen in people who were children at the time of the accident and lived in contaminated areas of the former Soviet Union — a more than ten-fold increase from normal levels (adults were mostly unaffected by the disease). Most of these cases were caused by drinking milk contaminated with radioiodine. Fewer than 20 of these people have died, but the sheer number of cancers, and their rapid onset within 5 years of the accident, surprised many epidemiologists.This triggered a plethora of thyroid studies, most notably a long-term cohort study of 25,000 people in Ukraine and Belarus who were children in 1986 that is being coordinated by the US National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda, Maryland. The latest results from the Ukrainian section of this cohort1 confirm previous findings that the incidence of thyroid cancer is proportional to the size of the dose, with a particularly high risk seen in younger people and in those who were iodine-deficient due to poor diet. The research is having a direct impact in Japan, where those at risk of exposure are being given potassium iodide tablets to prevent the uptake of radio­iodine in their thyroid.The NCI oversees a second cohort made up of liquidators, a group of more than half a million people sent into the exclusion zone to help clean up and monitor the area after the initial emergency phase of the accident. Liquidators have a slightly raised risk of developing cataracts, and possibly a small increased risk of leukaemia2.Long-term effectsBut what was the impact on the wider population? Various studies have tried to estimate how many deaths Chernobyl will eventually cause across the whole of Europe, but their answers range from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands3. Cancer causes about a quarter of all deaths in Europe, so teasing out Chernobyl's far-reaching influence would probably be impossible, say epidemiologists. Moreover, focusing on such intangible numbers can distract from the much broader social impact of the accident. In Ukraine and Belarus, hit hard by the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, lingering fears about radiation are thought to have contributed to a sense of hopelessness that is linked to high rates of alcoholism and smoking — factors that have a much bigger health impact.""There's tremendous uncertainty for these people,"" says Elisabeth Cardis, a radiation epidemiologist at the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain. ""Some think they are doomed because of their radiation exposure."" Further research could provide convincing evidence that Chernobyl's radiation did not significantly harm the wider population, but ""we won't know unless we look"", says Dillwyn Williams, a cancer researcher at the Strangeways Research Laboratory in Cambridge, UK.A handful of Chernobyl studies have found small increases in rates of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease, but they did not properly account for confounding factors, such as nutrition, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. And although some researchers have claimed to see an increase in genetic mutations in the children of parents irradiated after Chernobyl4, there has been no similar evidence of hereditary effects even in the children of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, who on average received much larger radiation doses.This means that there is still a substantial gap in the overall understanding of Chernobyl's health effects, says Williams. The problem is exacerbated by the piecemeal nature of previous studies. ""There has been a failure of European-level coordination on this,"" he says.Williams hopes that there is now a chance to establish a Chernobyl Health Effects Research Foundation, which would mirror the highly effective Radiation Effects Research Foundation that monitors the long-term health impacts of the atomic bombs in Japan. Together, the efforts could reveal the differences between the single short-term dose of external radiation delivered by the atomic bombs, and the low-level long-term exposure seen after Chernobyl. Long-term doses were once thought to carry much less risk than the immediate exposure, but evidence is accumulating that the risks may be much the same5. If confirmed, it would mean that people routinely exposed to low-level radiation have a greater chance of health problems than previously thought.The European Commission has funded Williams, Cardis and a core group of other scientists to develop a research plan, dubbed the Agenda for Research on Chernobyl Health (ARCH), that maps out how the existing cohorts could be used to study a wider range of diseases, such as breast cancer and cardiovascular disease, and to address the questions about the long-term effects of low doses. The liquidator cohort, for example, is six times larger than that of atomic bomb survivors, with a much wider range of exposure doses. It could show how risk varies over that large range of doses and uncover rarer effects at lower doses. It could also help to reassess the threshold dose to prevent nuclear workers from developing problems such as cataracts.ARCH also suggests testing the feasibility of setting up new cohorts including liquidators' offspring and highly exposed evacuees, along with a tissue bank. The bank may reveal whether people's genetic make-up influences their susceptibility to radiation — key information for determining how individuals are likely to respond to the radiation received during medical procedures such as X-ray scans and radiation treatment.There are several hurdles, however, to getting ARCH off the ground. The project needs support from the NCI, which stopped funding active clinical monitoring of the thyroid cohort in 2008 because of budgetary constraints. And ARCH's proposals would also require better access to medical records in Ukraine and more information about participants' lifestyle factors — both potentially tall orders.The ARCH plan will be presented at the 25th anniversary conference in April, and Cardis hopes that a positive reception will prompt the European Commission to boost its support. It is likely to be difficult to secure a long-term commitment for the studies, which will cost about €3 million to set up, but that cost is minor compared with the billions that will be spent on remediation at Chernobyl, says Williams.Beyond obtaining the necessary funds, researchers will also require cooperation from participants to expand the cohort studies. That could be difficult. Gennady Laptev, now a hydrologist based at the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute in Kiev, was a liquidator for three years, and says that he stopped attending his medical check-ups about ten years ago because they were too time-consuming. ""They never found any major health problems,"" he says.Laptev's work involved flying by helicopter from Kiev to Chernobyl twice a week to take radiation readings and collect soil and water samples for analysis. ""Nobody forced me to do the work — I did it because it was interesting, and I really enjoyed it,"" he says. But after three years, he became worried about the risk of working near the plant, so he took a job researching how radioisotopes dispersed in the local water system (see 'Life as a liquidator').Concerns about radiation exposure continue to plague residents in the region, and the planned studies could provide the answers they so desperately need about Chernobyl's real health legacy. ""I have a house in a village near Slavutych, on contaminated territory,"" says Antropov during the site visit. ""Two of my neighbours died of cancer, and this was probably the result of their radiation doses.""Lessons for JapanIt's too early to say how the Chernobyl health studies will help those affected by the Fukushima accident. But Chernobyl has already given the world a lasting lesson on the importance of clear communication during a nuclear disaster, and in the years afterwards.There was no systematic distribution of prophylactic potassium iodide to the people around Chernobyl, and Pripyat's children were allowed to play outside during the day after the accident, while the reactor continued to burn. ""The failure to rapidly communicate radiation risks at Chernobyl led to people receiving higher radiation exposures than was necessary,"" says Smith.The Japanese government has been lambasted for not keeping citizens well informed about the accident there. But it was swifter to act than Soviet officials were, ordering the evacuation of people who live near the plant within hours of recognizing the growing nuclear emergency, and expanding that evacuation zone to a radius of 20 kilometres the following day. As well as distributing potassium iodide, the Japanese government banned the sale of food and milk produced in the provinces around the stricken plant. ""The Japanese have done exactly the right thing,"" says Andrew Sherry, director of the Dalton Nuclear Institute at the University of Manchester, UK.Ultimately, says Smith, Chernobyl's most important lesson for Fukushima is that a nuclear accident haunts a region long after the reactors have cooled. If areas of Japan are significantly contaminated with radioactive caesium-137, which loses half its radioactivity in 30 years, the government may have to maintain an exclusion zone for decades. Decommissioning the Fukushima reactors may also take decades, depending on the extent of damage to their cores. And the uncertainty surrounding the health risks may exact a psychological toll that could surpass the physical harm from the radiation, adds Smith.Many of the workers at Chernobyl understand those lessons all too well as they shuffle onto the train to Slavutych at the end of their day. The workers will return to tend to the plant tomorrow and the next day — and for many years to come. Mark Peplow is Nature's news editor.ReferencesBrenner, A. V. et al. Environ.

Tomohiro Mogamiya, an official with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's water supply division, said that was ""extremely unlikely"" since groundwater would flow toward the ocean, and the plant is right on the coast.In the latest report of food becoming tainted, the government said on Friday that a cow slaughtered for beef had slightly elevated levels of cesium, another radioactive particle. Officials stressed that the meat was not put on the market.Despite the leaks, Tepco hasn't had enough dosimeters to provide one for each employee since many were destroyed in the earthquake. Under normal circumstances, the gauges, which measure radiation, would be worn at all times.Officials said on Friday that more meters had arrived and there were now enough for everyone.""We must ensure safety and health of the workers, but we also face a pressing need to get the work done as quickly as possible,"" said nuclear safety agency spokesman Hidehiko Nishiyama. Until now, sharing meters ""has been an unavoidable choice"".Tepco has repeatedly relaxed safety standards during the crisis in order to prevent frequent violations. That is not uncommon during emergencies.The company has acknowledged it was initially slow to ask for help in dealing with the crisis, but experts from around the world are now flooding in. The French nuclear giant Areva, which supplied fuel to the plant, is helping figure out how to dispose of contaminated water, and American nuclear experts are joining Japanese counterparts on a panel to address the disaster.Japan has ordered two giant pumps, typically used for spraying concrete, from the US. They are being retrofitted to spray water first, according to Kelly Blickle, a spokeswoman at Putzmeister America in Wisconsin. At least one similar pump is already in operation at the plant"
1068,Lalmohan,01 Apr 2011 15:03 ,"and the cynical financial industry neo-fascists chip inSushi Safe From Japan Radiation as Ocean Makes Risk Negligible“Eating fish is not something to worry about,” said Gale, a visiting hematology professor at Imperial College London who was in Japan this week to speak to doctors responding to radiation threats. “No one could afford to consume enough sushi to get radiation damage.” Since last week, the Fisheries Research Agency has tested samples from five types of fish caught off the coast of Choshi city in Chiba prefecture, the fishing area south of the Fukushima nuclear plant. The institute has been monitoring radioactivity in Japanese marine life for the past five decades, after nuclear arms testing by the U.S. and the former Soviet Union raised concerns about contamination. Cesium Levels The institute detected 3 becquerel per kilogram of cesium-137 in anchovy, but nothing in samples from alfonsino, mackerel, spear squid and olive flounder. The level was far below the standard set by Japan’s health ministry of 500 becquerel per kilogram for fish. Radioactive elements in the ocean are significantly less harmful than if they are airborne or permeate the soil, Gale said. “From a radiation safety point of view, if it’s got to go somewhere, that’s the best place,” he said. “Radiation is least dangerous to humans when diluted, so the sea is the perfect place.” While dilution lessens the risks the further marine life is from the source of contamination, Qian said people should avoid any seafood from the immediate vicinity of the Fukushima plant. “Be alert, but don’t panic,” he said.

The focus zone stretches about 450 kilometers north to south.The data showed that the seabed rose by about 5 meters in the quake.The researchers said the massive tsunamis were caused by the sudden rise in the seabed over wide areas.They also believe the tsunami waves grew larger as they approached the coasts and encountered shallower water. They say this caused tsunami higher than 10 meters over wide areas.Hino said the data on previous major quakes showed that the related seabed elevations were at the most 2 meters."

Would they express concern? Or would they list a series of disasters that have overtaken India - from Bhopal to famines, Gujarat etc and sneerily ask if SDREs are capable of looking after such things.As I see it - it is a waste of time arguing whether radioactive contamination is unsafe or not and exactly how unsafe a given level of contamination might be which is about as far as the discussion seems to have gone.But unless I am grossly mistaken the reactor safety mechanisms have failed and the much dreaded ""meltdown"" has occurred patchily leading to some contamination. It may have been controlled now, but those reactors are history as far as initial assessments go. Does Japan need support? Yes insofar as we can offer support?Does Japan need sympathy? Yes for the human sufferingBut do hard questions need to be asked whether everything was done properly or not in much praised and admired Japan? Yes to that as well. Japan is a country that is very earthquake prone and has active volcanoes. the word ""Tsunami"" is a Japanese word. Tsunamis are known to be caused by offshore earthquakes. Is someone trying to say that the Japanese did not anticipate an earthquake and tsunami at a coastal nuclear plant? Below is a random image of the Fukushima plant.Is someone telling me that this plant is protected against Tsunamis? Frankly a glass of water splashed with force on the floor towards a wall has enough energy to wet the wall at least 15 cm up.

This gives borrowers access to capital markets at the same low interest rates available to the government. Despite the hurdles, nuclear remains an economically viable source of electricity, once the plants manage to get built, he said.”The variable costs of nuclear are low but fixed costs are very high,” Dobson said. “Certainly, financing risks borne by equity and debt holders ... those same debt holders will be staring at safety standards.”Meanwhile, other types of power such as wind, natural gas and solar, cost less and take less time to build, offering investors quicker returns, he said.

1103,shiv,02 Apr 2011 06:40 ,"I like the aircraft window analogy because it is a good example of what happens when science meets human. Fears, emotions and preferences come into play that have effects on other human parameters like popularity, profits and reputation. I am guessing that is why you have managers. I recall reading that having  no aircraft windows and seats facing backwards would be the safest in an aircraft. No windows would mean safer and cheaper construction. Seats facing backwards would certainly have saved lives. But rather than educating the public the thrust is on glossing over these things and asking engineers to compensate and take a less safe route for piskological reasons. And yes, there is a surgical analogy as well for when science meets human. The surgeon removes his sutures on the patient's belly 7 days after surgery and the patient asks him ""Doc has the wound healed?"". The doctor beams at the patient and says ""it's perfect! It's all healed up!"" Balls. What the doctor does not tell the patient is that the total healing and remodelling time will be 6 months. The patient still has a chance of infection manifesting for a few days. The would could still split open. The patient could still suffer from vein thrombosis, throw a clot and die suddenly. And he will likely have continuing pain for several weeks. Telling the patient that could leave him a quivering mass of anxieties and fears, unable to return to work and dependent on the doctor for reassurance for months. That happens too. I studied science too and using science forms part of my day to day life. For various reasons (including an interest in aircraft, children's exams and BRF) I have kept in touch with non medical science to some extent. After Chernobyl, when I worried about contaminated milk, living in the UK (and took some measures to avoid that) I have stayed in touch with layman level science of nuclear reactors. For example I knew that a  reactor will not explode like a nuclear bomb. I am not sure that this fact is known to most people who use the power of a nuclear bomb to inflate their sex toys or make their cuppa the morning after. That is because the fact that reactors use the power of the atom as in atom bomb has been irresponsibly hyped far more than reality.On the other hand, a person like me, reasonably informed knew about control rods that could be inserted to stop neutrons from flying around and cutting short the chain reaction. What I did not know was that after the insertion of control rods the reactor will still need several weeks of cooling before it actually becomes safe and the safety mechanisms for that cooling have to be as robust and dependable as the control rods and have to last for weeks. This was precisely what failed at Fukushima. I am certain the GE (or was it Westinghouse?) engineers in the 1960s planned for earthquakes. But they certainly did not plan for Tsunamis. This is bit like saying that someone was born because his father did not know about condoms. What has happened has happened. But knowing that accountants, managers and shareholders have as big a stake in a company as the engineers who make the stuff that the company profits from, I would be curious to know whether this could have been anticipated 40 years ago but was glossed over because someone somewhere decided that it was too inconvenient and too unlikely to consider."
1104,abhishek_sharma,02 Apr 2011 06:59 ,"Fukushima update: did nuclear chain reactions continue after shut-down? - April 01, 2011http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2011/04/fukushima_update_did_nuclear_c.htmlThere is growing evidence that uranium and plutonium fuel at the Fukushima nuclear plant may have continued nuclear fission chain reactions long after the reactors were shut down almost three weeks ago. This worrying development may explain the continued release of some shorter-lived radioisotopes from the stricken site.Tepco, the plant operator, said earlier this week that it had – on 13 occasions – detected beams of neutrons near the reactors. Neutrons are produced during fission of nuclear fuel, and are the key driver of the chain reaction that sustains continuous fission reactions in a reactor.Japan Today reports that ""the neutron beam was measured about 1.5 kilometers southwest of the plant’s No. 1 and 2 reactors over three days from March 13.""The neutron beam didn't pack much of a punch – if anyone got in its way, it would likely deliver a dose of just 0.01 to 0.02 microsieverts per hour. But the finding tallies with a recent analysis of other isotopes found at the plant, published in the Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan FocusFerenc Dalnoki-Veress, at the James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies of the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California, hones in on the significance of a very short-lived radioisotope, chlorine-38, in the water in the turbine building of reactor 1.In an introduction to the analysis, Arjun Makhijani, president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, an energy and environment information-provider based in Takoma Park, Maryland, explains:Chlorine-38, which has a half-life of only 37 minutes, is created when stable chlorine-37, which is about one-fourth of the chlorine in salt, absorbs a neutron. Since seawater has been used to cool [the reactors], there is now a large amount of salt – thousands of kilograms – in all three reactors. Now, if a reactor is truly shut down, there is only one source of neutrons – spontaneous fission of some heavy metals that are created when the reactor is working that are present in the reactor fuel. The most important ones are two isotopes of plutonium and two of curium.But if accidental chain reactions are occurring, it means that the efforts to completely shut down the reactor by mixing boron with the seawater have not completely succeeded. Periodic criticalities, or even a single accidental one, would mean that highly radioactive fission and activation products are being (or have been) created at least in Unit 1 since it was shut down. It would also mean that one or more intense bursts of neutrons, which cause heavy radiation damage to people, have occurred and possibly could occur again, unless the mechanism is understood and measures taken to prevent it. Measures would also need to be taken to protect workers and to measure potential neutron and gamma radiation exposure.There's a great debate about the implications of all this going on over at Arms Control Wonk.And also see below in our comments thread - some very good counterarguments.Fukushima update: more radiation data errors - April 01, 2011http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2011/04/fukushima_update_more_radiatio.htmlFukushima update: more radiation data errors - April 01, 2011As the battle continues at the Fukushima reactors, the 'fog of war' has once again descended, throwing doubt on vital groundwater contamination data.Yesterday, Kyodo News reported that the first groundwater contamination at the Fukushima power plant had been detected, and cited levels 10,000 times the legal limits. The number came from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), the plant operator.Today, Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said that Tepco's data was wrong, although there is little doubt that groundwater has been contaminated. According to Kyodo News: Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the governmental nuclear regulatory body, said it was ''extremely regrettable'' that TEPCO had given incorrect radiation data at the plant for the second time. The agency has strongly warned the operator over the matter and urged it to take steps not to do so again, he added.Problems with Tepco's analysis software are being blamed for the error. Tepco has already had to retract data showing incredibly high radiation levels in water flooding the basement beneath reactor 2.Meanwhile, Tepco is also under fire for not protecting its workers adequately. The LA Times notes that ""many workers at the facility do not have radiation monitoring badges. Tepco, which owns the facility, confirmed the report, noting that much of its supplies had been destroyed in the magnitude 9 Tohoku earthquake and the tsunami that followed it. But company officials said that the leaders of each team of workers have a badge and that workers without badges are assigned to areas with low radiation risk.""In other news, Tepco workers will spray a water-soluble resin over debris scattered around the plant to damp down radioactive dust that could be blown into the air. The company expects to use 60,000 litres of the resin over the next two weeks.(Kyodo News)It will come as no surprise that Tepco has said the four damaged nuclear reactors will have to be scrapped, at a cost of billions of dollars (Daily Yomiuri, and many others).For full coverage of the Fukushima disaster, go to Nature's news special."

Overall, ""the situation remains very serious,"" the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reiterated at a briefing today.To recap briefly on past events; concerns focus on reactors 1 to 3, all of whose cores seem to clearly have undergone meltdowns to greater-or-lesser extents, and which have already released radioactive material during venting to the atmosphere -- carried out to release pressure in the containment vessels. Electricity supplies have not yet been established to their permanent coolant systems, so emergency injection of water using temporary pumps is still being relied upon. At reactor 4, concerns are different -- the reactor's core had been transferred to a cooling pond during reactor maintenance at the time the quake and tsunami hit, leaving the core's fuel rods -- lacking a containment vessel -- exposed directly to the air when water levels in the pool fell and fuel rods overheated; water injection has since stabilized the pool.There have been few new developments today in the status of these 4 reactors, but here are quick summaries of some other related developments. Many of these are related to local pollution around the site, resulting both from the accidents themselves and from collateral damage resulting from the desperate efforts to cool the reactors, and prevent full-scale meltdowns.First reported groundwater contamination:Kyodo News are tonight reporting that the first groundwater contamination at the Fukushima power plant has been detected. It cites levels 10,000 times the legal limits. This is just a heads up; more later when I get some data. The risk of groundwater contamination has been high on people's minds since the discovery last weekend of large volumes of highly radioactive water -- some of it extremely radioactive -- in the basements of the plant's reactors, and in large trenches outside of the reactors -- see my article in Nature this week, for more on this, and more quantitative data -- Radioactivity spreads in Japan.Seawater contamination: The key point here seems to be that whereas much of the initial offshore radioactive pollution was caused by deposition from the large atmospheric plumes of radioactivity released, local marine pollution now seems to be being continually fed from near shore local release emanating from the plant's discharge channels. The IAEA reported tonight that:""The latest analyses in seawater 330 m south of the discharge point of NPP Units 1-4, and 30 m north of the discharge point of Units 5-6 were made available for 29 March. In particular readings of 130 000 Bq/l of I-131, 32 000 Bq/l of Cs-137 and 31 000 Bq/l of Cs-134 were reported near Units 1 - 4.""These are almost double figures reported by IAEA earlier this week: that radioactivity levels near the plant's discharge pipes were increasing, with 74,000 Bq l−1 of iodine-131 and 12,000 Bq l−1 of caesium-134 and caesium-137 combined. Recommended maximum coastal discharges from nuclear power plants are typically lower than 4,000 Bq l−1.As I've pointed out before, marine readings can vary widely depending on currents and discharge rates; what's worrying though most of all is not the variation in the readings but that high levels of radioactive discharges from the plant to the sea are continuing unabated. The IAEA has a French group from Toulouse, Sirocco, doing modelling of where that marine radioactivity might go, but it's results so far seem fairly preliminary.Japan is already busy dealing with the after-effects of a huge quake and tsunami, and now a nuclear disaster, and although IAEA and other international agencies are on the job, I'm still a bit surprised at how little we are hearing of any organized international academic efforts to urgently bring top academic scientific expertise to bear on helping plan and execute such essential monitoring work at sea and on land, as well as the many other epidemiological and other studies that could inform efforts -- if you are a scientist involved in such, do get in touch with me at d.butler@nature.com.And the data coming out, while fairly transparent on the whole -- by past nuclear industry standards -- are often disparate, poorly organized, incomplete, in multiple units lacking context or explanation, and in clumsy formats such as pdfs that make independent machine-readable data analysis difficult -- in Web terms, the ways in which data are generally being made available publicly in response to this crisis look much like the 1990's Web, rather than the 21st century Web of web services and real-time mapping. Data may not seem an immediate priority, given the scale and urgency of the crisis, but clearer information and data would without any doubt help alleviate the obvious confusion that is currently being experienced by many, not surprisingly concerned, Japanese, and others, as to the ongoing consequences of this nuclear accident, and also spur scientific analyses by the broader research community worldwide. Public and scientific data dissemination is an essential part of emergency planning, but so far the authorities involved, including IAEA, are falling short of what's needed. ISIS report slams data collection at Fukushima-Daichii plant: The Institute for Science and International Security, a fairly well-respected body in nuclear nonproliferation work has tonight released a Preliminary Assessment of Accident Sequences and Potential Atmospheric Radiation Releases. I found its painstaking analysis of radiation readings from the plant itself, and their shortcomings, a useful new analysis.Other snippets from today's IAEA briefing:Radiation measurements in Tokyo: ""Two IAEA teams are currently monitoring radiation levels and radioactivity in the environment in Japan. On 30 March, one team made gamma dose-rate measurements in the Tokyo region at 7 locations. Gamma-dose rates measured ranged from 0.03 to 0.28 microsievert per hour, which is within or slightly above the background.""Food: ""Since our briefing of yesterday, significant data related to food contamination has been submitted by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Seventy-six samples were taken from 28-30 March, and reported on 30 March. Analytical results for 51 of the 76 samples for various vegetables, fruit (strawberry), seafood (sardines), and unprocessed raw milk in eight prefectures (Chiba, Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Kanagawa, Niigata, Saitama, and Yamagata), indicated that iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137 were either not detected or were below the regulation values set by the Japanese authorities. However, it was reported that analytical results in Fukushima prefecture for the remaining 25 of the 76 samples for broccoli, cabbage, rapeseed, spinach and other leafy vegetables, indicated that iodine-131 and/or caesium-134 and caesium-137 exceeded the regulation values set by the Japanese authorities.""Drinking water: ""Most of the previously imposed recommendations for restrictions on drinking have been lifted. As of 28 March, recommendations for restrictions based on I-131 concentration remain in place in four villages of in the Fukushima prefecture, in three of these villages, restrictions continue to apply for infants only.""For full coverage of the Fukushima disaster, go to Nature's news special.

These pills protect people from the long-term risks of thyroid cancer associated with chronic radiation exposure, but they do little to guard against the ill effects of high-dose radiation toxicity.Unfortunately, no drugs are currently approved to treat the extreme radiation sickness that plant workers or emergency personnel may experience. Yet, thanks to investment from the US government, several candidate compounds might soon be available in the event of another nuclear catastrophe.The Project BioShield Act, passed by Congress in 2004, and the Pandemic and All-Hazard Preparedness Act, signed into law two years later, allotted billions of dollars in funding for research into medical countermeasures to be used in the case of nuclear, chemical and biological attacks. These government awards include more than $500 million for the treatment and prevention of so-called acute radiation syndrome (ARS), the extreme radiation sickness associated with exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation over a short period of time.In addition to terrorism, nuclear plant disasters are a leading cause of ARS. The 1986 explosion at Ukraine’s Chernobyl plant, for example, caused 134 confirmed cases of ARS, accounting for almost one third of the reported incidences of the disease worldwide (Health Phys. 93, 462–469, 2007). Over the past week, engineers in Japan have made headway in containing leaks at the Fukushima site and seemed to have averted a meltdown. But radiation at the plant had already spiked to dangerous levels, forcing hundreds of exposed emergency workers to temporarily evacuate.If any of these workers are diagnosed with ARS, their treatment options currently are limited to antibiotics, blood transfusions and fluid supplements that deal with the symptoms of the disease. Physicians also sometimes administer cancer drugs that help the immune system rebound, but these drugs must be given in medical facilities. Now, however, researchers are developing biologics and small molecule drugs that be used in the field to stem radiation’s ill effects.One of the lead candidates — a drug called CBLB502 being developed by Cleveland BioLabs of Buffalo, New York — binds an immune protein called Toll-like receptor 5 to activate a cell survival pathway. In unpublished data from rodent and monkey models, the drug, which is derived from a protein found in the flagella of Salmonella bacteria, remained “very efficacious” up to 48 hours after exposure, according to Cleveland BioLabs’ chief scientific officer Andrei Gudkov.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the compound fast-track status in July 2010, and, backed by a $15.6 million award from the US government, the company has already tested CBLB502 in 150 healthy volunteers in two phase 1 safety studies. According to spokesperson Rachel Levine, the company plans to submit an approval application by the end of next year.Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania-based biotech Onconova is advancing its own compound, Ex-RAD, which works by inhibiting proapoptosis proteins such as p53 as well as downstream regulators of cell death. According to Ramesh Kumar, Onconova’s president and CEO, the small molecule has been tested for safety in more than 50 people, with few adverse effects reported.Fresh bloodInstead of trying to block cell death, some companies are developing treatments that simply replace the cells lost to radiation. For example, the California-based biotech Cellerant Therapeutics has a system based on blood progenitor cells that can form mature infection-fighting and clotting blood cells upon infusion by intravenous drip. Importantly, these cells — dubbed CLT-008 — do not produce the mature T cells that cause immune reactions, so just one product can be stored to serve as a temporary therapy for all ARS-affected individuals. What’s more, unlike many other ARS drug candidates, CLT-008 seems to work up to a week after exposure. “By that time, you’d actually have a chance to evacuate people out of the city,” notes Mark Whitnall, head of the radiation countermeasures program at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.Other products in development include Osiris Therapeutics’ Prochymal, a stem cell therapy derived from adult bone marrow for the treatment of organ damage resulting from radiation exposure, and Aeolus Pharmaceuticals’ AEOL-10150, a small molecule that reduces oxidative stress and inflammation associated with radiation exposure. Both companies have government contracts that exceed $100 million.Notably, all of these experimental ARS treatments are being developed under the FDA’s ‘animal rule’, which provides a path to drug approval for life-threatening agents where human efficacy trials aren’t ethical or feasible. This regulatory route still requires safety testing in humans, large-scale efficacy studies in animal models and a good understanding of the drug’s mechanism of action. But the exact requirements of the rule — which was introduced in 2002 — remain unclear to many drug developers. “The mechanism is very vague,” says Kumar.What’s more, even after these drugs gain approval, another hurdle remains for companies to make money. “Who are the eventual buyers and consumers of this drug?” Kumar asks. “That is a bigger question.” "

""But ground motions that have not yet been recorded also matter. There may be a limit that earthquake motions will never exceeded.

1116,chaanakya,02 Apr 2011 12:40 ,"Japan must distribute iodine tablets urgentlyREUTERS        PARIS -- Japanese authorities grappling with a nuclear disaster must hand out iodine tablets now and as widely as possible to avoid a potential leap in thyroid cancers, the head of a group of independent radiation experts said.France's CRIIRAD group says Japan has underestimated the sensitivity of the thyroid gland to radioactivity and must lower its 100 millisieverts (mSv) threshold for administering iodine.Failure to do so quickly could lead to an even higher jump in thyroid cancer cases in coming years than is anticipated, Corinne Castanier told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.""They should still do it (distribute iodine) now because the contamination continues but it will be less efficient. They have to limit the damage. It's not too late to act but they have to distribute them as widely and as fast as possible,"" she said.In 2009 France lowered the threshold at which it administers iodine pills in case of nuclear disaster to 50 mSv, a measure of the amount of radiation received by people, from 100 mSv, following guidelines established by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the wake of the Chernobyl accident.The WHO also set its threshold for children, pregnant women and women breastfeeding at 10 mSv.In a nuclear accident, it is the discharge of iodine 131 into the atmosphere that constitutes the greatest health risk. The nuclide's radioactivity halves after 8 days.If radioactive iodine is breathed in or swallowed, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland and increase the risk of thyroid cancer, the WHO said.This risk can be lowered by taking potassium iodide pills to saturate the gland and help prevent the uptake of radioactive material when given before or shortly after exposure.On March 16 Japanese authorities advised people living in a 20-km radius of the crippled plant to take iodine tablets five days after the catastrophic 9.0 earthquake and tsunami.""Japanese authorities should have given out iodine tablets in a radius of 100-150 kilometers around the Fukushima-Daiichi plant and done so right after the accident,"" Castanier said.""There is no major negative impact in iodine tablets so they should distribute them as widely as possible,"" she said.The level of radioactive iodine found in seawater near the stricken nuclear power plant was 4,385 times the legal limit on Thursday, the Japanese nuclear safety agency said. That was the highest level registered since the crisis began.Radioactive discharge levels from the Fukushima plant were very high in the first days after the accident, Castanier said."

1119,chaanakya,02 Apr 2011 13:09 ,"TEPCO failures multiply / Compounding of missteps exacerbated nuclear crisisThe Yomiuri ShimbunTokyo Electric Power Co.'s failure in its initial response to the crisis at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture invited more trouble in a chain reaction, according to an analysis of events over the past three weeks since the March 11 great earthquake and tsunami.At the crippled nuclear power plant, three reactors have been cooled by injecting water using temporarily set up pumps. However, there are fears the spent nuclear fuel rods stored in the reactors' temporary storage pools will overheat again.TEPCO's sloppy way of publicly releasing information related to the accident also has drawn much criticism.===Vent operation in troubleThe power plant lost all power on the afternoon of March 11 due to the gigantic tsunami that followed the great earthquake, causing an emergency halt to the operations of the Nos. 1 to 3 reactors. The Nos. 4 to 6 reactors already were not operating due to periodic inspections.Temperatures and pressures inside the pressure vessels of the Nos. 1 to 3 reactors began rising sharply, complicating the injection of cooling water into the reactors. When the level of water in the reactors drops, nuclear fuel rods become exposed, overheat and may start melting, risking damage to the reactor as well as the emission of radioactive substances.On the night of March 11, TEPCO planned a controlled release of vapor mixed with radioactive substances from the No. 1 reactor, in an operation to decrease pressure in the pressure vessel.However, the operation was not carried out until 10:17 a.m. the following day, four hours after Prime Minister Naoto Kan left the Prime Minister's Office to travel to the Fukushima Prefecture plant for an inspection. Also, evacuation of residents in areas within 10 kilometers of the power plant had not been completed at that time.Then, on the afternoon of March 12, a hydrogen explosion occurred at the No. 1 reactor, destroying the reactor building roof.Kenzo Miya, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, an expert on nuclear engineering, said the prime minister's inspection delayed TEPCO's original plans to vent the pressure vessel.""Because of the prime minister's [impending] inspection, the start of the 'vent' was delayed. The possibility that the subsequent actions all fell behind can't be denied,"" Miya said.Haruki Madarame, chairman of the Cabinet Office's Nuclear Safety Commission, also noted the time-loss disadvantage.""Work [to conduct the 'vent'] took time to get under way. As a result, several hours were lost before starting to inject seawater [to cool the reactor]. It was a painful incident,"" Madarame said, when recalling the situation on the night of March 23.Meanwhile, TEPCO President Masataka Shimizu and Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata were on separate business trips on March 11 when the tsunami hit the plant. They could not return to Tokyo until the following day. ""As we communicated with cell phones and other measures, there were no chain of command problems,"" an official of TEPCO's public relations department said.However, the absence of top management officials might have resulted in the delay in the initial response, some people involved in the handling of the accident said.===Use of seawaterTo cool the reactor core, TEPCO started injecting seawater in the No. 1 reactor shortly after 8 p.m. on March 12--a full 19 hours since the containment vessel's pressure began rising abnormally.Since TEPCO began injecting seawater to cool the Nos. 2 and 3 reactors on March 13, the operation was believed to have only a limited effect.On March 14 at the No. 2 reactor, cooling water ran out of supply due to loss of fuel for temporary pumps. On the morning of March 15, an explosion at the reactor was believed to have damaged its pressure suppression chamber, part of the containment vessel.It is suspected that water contaminated with high concentration of radioactive substances leaked from the chamber to the reactor's turbine building. The water continues to hamper restoration work at the plant.Since seawater contains impurities, and its use as a coolant damages the reactors, TEPCO had to consider possibly decomissioning the reactors.""Crucial efforts to tame Japan's crippled nuclear plant were delayed by concerns over damaging valuable power assets,"" The Wall Street Journal reported in its electronic edition on March 19.TEPCO was ""reluctant to use seawater because it worried about hurting its long-term investment in the complex,"" the report added, quoting people familiar with the situation.TEPCO Vice President Sakae Muto tried hard to refute the criticism in a press conference on the night of March 21.""We've been exercising maximum effort to cool down the reactors,"" he said.===Storage pool for spent fuel rodsAnother factor complicating the handling of the nuclear crisis was the delay in TEPCO's response to cool the temporary storage pools for spent nuclear fuel rods.Although the amount of heat generated by the fuel rods in the storage pools is less than the nuclear fuel within a reactor core, the central problem remains: If the fuel rods are exposed when water levels decrease, they will become damaged by overheating.The storage pools are even more dangerous as they could easily discharge radioactivity as they are not stored in a tightly enclosed structure as a reactor.The attention of the government and TEPCO initially only focused on the reactors themselves. However, both parties also began to consider the threat posed by the temporary storage pools on about March 13, around the time the temperatures of the pools were believed to have begun to rise due to the halt in the circulation of cooling water.At the No. 4 reactor, the pool temperature rose to 84 C on the morning of March 14. In the early hours of the morning of March 15, an explosion and a fire took place at the reactor building, which also houses a temporary storage pool for spent nuclear fuel rods.===TEPCO updates late, unreliableTokyo Electric Power Co. has been criticized for its delays in disclosing information and repeatedly making inconsistent announcements about the problems at Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.For example, when explosions at buildings housing reactors at the plant were aired live on TV, TEPCO made no prompt statement about the facts behind the incidents.TEPCO's failure to obtain and distribute information about important developments at the plant in a proper manner has been partly due to the fragile state of its internal telecommunications network, which has hampered the transfer of information within the company.(Apr. 2, 2011)"

She said Areva would provide maximum support to Japan.Areva, which has tie-ups with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. and has won many contracts to build nuclear power plants in France, where nuclear power is the primary source of electricity, agreed with Chinese companies in November and December to supply them with uranium. The company also recently signed a deal with India to manufacture nuclear reactors.Areva has aggressively expanded its business, stepping up marketing efforts to sell its nuclear power plants in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries this year.However, the business environment changed significantly after the series of accidents at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant. China temporarily suspended new nuclear power plant projects while antinuclear power plant movements had a resurgence in Europe.The crisis has depressed Areva stock, which dropped 12.8 percent from the 35.95 euros (4,257 yen) posted on March 10, the day before the quake, to 31.35 euros at Wednesday's close in Paris.With environmental awareness rising, nuclear power plants, which do not emit carbon dioxide, had been again viewed as a clean energy source, and plant construction had been accelerating until just recently.However, the nuclear power boom seems to be quickly fading in the United States in the wake of the series of accidents at the Fukushima facility..................GE hastily moved to deny liability for the reactors, saying the size of the March 11 earthquake was far larger than the assumptions when they were designed in the 1960s.[/b]GE's stock has fallen about 7 percent from the 20 dollars (1,670 yen) level seen on March 11.About 30 nuclear reactors were set to be built by 2030 in the United States, where plant construction had long been frozen after the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident.However, the U.S. Congress has been cautious about advancing the planned projects, with Sen. Joe Lieberman saying the United States should ""put the brakes on"" new nuclear power plants.GE set a target of winning 38 nuclear reactor projects by 2030 while Westinghouse Electric Co., which is a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp., was aiming to win contracts to build 39 reactors by 2015.Sources close to the companies said their plans would inevitably be delayed due to the March 11 earthquake.If troubles worsened at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, the companies would be forced to revise their outlook and their financial performance might be seriously affected as a result, observers said.(Apr. 2, 2011)"

In addition to the areas laid waste by the tsunami, the ongoing crisis at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant could leave large tracts of land abandoned for a long period of time.To address the scale of the tragedy, the special legislation will increase the burden the central government must pay to move disaster victims into evacuation shelters. Under the existing disaster relief law, the central government is required to fund three-fourths of the cost, according to the sources. The bigger ratio will ease the burden on local governments, which must pay for a quarter of the costs under the current system.The legislation will also allow the central government to quickly purchase land made vacant by tsunami. Nationalizing land would facilitate the rebirth of tsunami-hit communities by coordinating reconstruction efforts, the sources said.The legislative package will also abolish a system that reduces the gasoline tax by about 25 yen per liter when the national average price of regular gas tops 160 yen per liter for three months straight, the sources said. The tax-cut system could reduce government revenue by hundreds of billions of yen per year.For farmers who have suffered losses due to the Fukushima nuclear crisis, the planned special legislation will provide speedy lump-sum payments before exact compensation amounts are calculated according to the Compensation for Nuclear Damages Law, they said. The legislative package will also enable bans on shipments of radiation-affected crops to be lifted speedily and flexibly when the levels are deemed no threat to human health.And to help disaster victims rebuild their lives, tax breaks or cuts will be given for home construction and vehicle purchases, the sources said.Finally, the package will establish a ""restoration promotion headquarters"" that includes the entire Cabinet as well as a ""restoration agency,"" they said.(Apr. 2, 2011)"

Since it is possible in actuality, such risks are all covered in actuality, therefore risks are ""costless"" in the sense they are all actually monetarily compensated for. Only one must use qualified experts who construct such things on a daily basis to leave sufficient loopholes which can later on be used by claiming that the bonds issued never said that they would actually cover for the risks. This will reduce the risks of the underwriters at least.Although, those who are most likely to suffer the consequences are also the most likely to be unable to spare the money to buy these bonds and ""financial instruments"". This means these overwhelming numerical majority are unlikely to be able to manipulate and raise the returns from such bonds, which in turn means that they may not have any control over compensation.

Her son Yukiyoshi, 38, cried out at the sight of her, ''Sorry, mom, sorry I left you.''The 46-member National Disaster Response Force from India, which arrived in Japan on March 28 on its first relief operation overseas, has taken charge of the search for people still missing in the town after the March 11 tsunami as well as recovery of bodies and clearing away of debris.The team's leader, Commandant Alok Avasthy, said that while it was too late for the group to save people's lives, it had many tasks ahead of it. ''After seeing the devastation caused by the earthquake and the tsunami there's still a lot of work to be done,'' he said.The tsunami following the magnitude 9.0 earthquake reached as far as around a kilometer inland from the port of Onagawa, destroying the center of the town and leaving more than 1,000 people dead or missing out of the town's population of about 10,000.The team was able to recover 59-year-old Junko's body in the Aratate district after Taichi Watanabe, 26, and three other volunteer interpreters found out that Yukiyoshi had been continuously searching for the bodies of his mother and of his 87-year-old grandfather Keiji Ishimori in the area.Avasthy, 41, then ordered his men to comb through the pile of debris identified by Yukiyoshi.Yukiyoshi said his mother's cry for help as she was being washed away by the tsunami still rings in his ears. ''Even if I'm tired and ready to go to sleep, I wake up recalling my mother's cry for help,'' he said. He also pictures her arm reaching out of the water in a desperate attempt to hold on to something, the last sight he had of her alive.The NDRF was set up in 2005 following the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The force has 10 battalions around India, each with about 1,000 members. ''As India's presence in the international community has become larger due to its economic growth, it also has begun to be active in international contributions,'' a Japanese government official said.Inspector Ajay Kumar, a member of the team who spent two and a half months doing relief work in India during the Indian Ocean disaster, said that the Indian team is well trained and is a dedicated force focused on dealing with natural, chemical, nuclear and biological disasters.''So many devastations came in one moment, it was an unbelievable phenomenon, a mega disaster'' said Kumar, referring to last month's quake and tsunami that have left over 27,000 people dead or missing in northeastern and eastern Japan.The Indian government has supplied Japan with 25,000 blankets and 13,000 bottles of water, and is one of the 23 countries and regions to have dispatched rescue teams or experts to Japan to help deal with the natural disaster or the nuclear crisis in Fukushima Prefecture, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.The Indian team, which had recovered five bodies as of Saturday, is scheduled to wrap up its relief operation Wednesday.''I can't express what I am seeing. We underwent training for this...but all the scenes (here) are unique, beyond imagination,'' said Avasthy, who has a 17-year career in the field.''Japan is a dedicated, disciplined country, sincere country. They have proved (so) previously. I am 100 percent sure (the Japanese people) will make those cities even more beautiful cities, very early, very early, of that I am sure,'' he said.==Kyodo"
1132,chaanakya,03 Apr 2011 11:20 ,"Restarting cooling systems takes a back seat to storage, disposalAs for the flooded No. 1 turbine building, Tepco was pumping the water into a condenser tank but was forced to transfer it to another vessel after the tank got full. The work reduced the water in the basement from a depth of 40 cm to about 20 cm.Work to remove contaminated water from reactors 2 and 3, however, has yet to start. The crucial task of restoring electricity for the reactor cooling systems has meanwhile been delayed.Experts warned that condenser tanks won't be able to hold all the water.While the government has mulled anchoring tankers by the plant to store the water and building a facility to properly dispose of it, the city of Shizuoka announced Friday it will provide its mega-float, a huge barge, to Tepco for storing the water.Tepco estimates the vessel can store about 10,000 tons of water, while the amount of water detected in the plant has reached around 13,000 tons.Misawa said it is highly possible the No. 2 reactor's pressure vessel is damaged, since the water in its turbine building is extremely contaminated, showing surface-level radiation in excess of 1,000 millisieverts per hour.Radionuclide analysis of that water showed it contains not only volatile iodine-131 and cesium-134, but also the more stable lanthanum-140 and barium-140. All four substances are believed to have come from atomic fission, meaning ""some part of the pressure vessel is probably damaged,"" Misawa said.But at the same time, the reactor does not appear to be in a dangerous enough state to cause another hydrogen explosion because its temperature is hovering around 180 degrees, he said. Hydrogen only emerges when the temperature rises high enough to start the fuel rods' zirconium casings burning, allowing them to react with the water in the pressure vessel.Assuming the situation at Fukushima No. 1 is eventually brought under control, the challenge of decommissioning reactor Nos. 1 through 4, which Tepco Chairman Tsuneyoshi Katsumata has said is probably unavoidable, awaits. But decommissioning damaged nuclear power plants is a very lengthy, tricky and expensive project.Even shutting down a regular nuclear plant requires time and money. At the nation's first nuclear power plant in Tokai, Ibaraki Prefecture, which ended operations in 1998, it took three years just to remove spent fuel rods. Work to complete the process is slated to end in 2020 and cost a total of ¥89 billion, according to some media reports.Ex-Toshiba engineer Ogawa said that when decommissioning a normal plant there are a limited number of places where the radiation level is high, so even though the work is time-consuming, it can advance according to plan.But ""it is going to be very different in the case of Fukushima,"" he said, as places that are not supposed to have high levels of radiation have been contaminated, such as the basement floor of the No. 2 turbine building"

Radiation has been spewing from the plant, leaking into the air, ground and sea. On Saturday, authorities discovered a crack from which radioactive water was spilling into the Pacific—the first time they identified a direct source of sea contamination.  A picture released by TEPCO shows water shooting some distance away from a wall and splashing into the sea, though the amount of water was not clear. The contaminated water will quickly dissipate in the ocean but could pose a danger to workers at the plant.A nuclear plant worker who fell into the ocean Friday while trying to board a barge carrying water to help cool the plant did not show any immediate signs of being exposed to unsafe levels of radiation, nuclear safety officials said Saturday, but they were waiting for test results to be sure.  Workers have been reluctant to talk to the media about what they are experiencing, but one who spent several days at the plant described difficult conditions in an anonymous interview published Saturday in the national Mainichi newspaper.  When he was called in mid-March to help restore power at the plant, he said he did not tell his family because he didn’t want them to worry. But he did tell a friend to notify his parents if he did not return in two weeks.  “I feel very strongly that there is nobody but us to do this job, and we cannot go home until we finish the work,” he said.

They were all taken to hospital.Eleven workers (four Tepco workers, three subcontract workers and four members of Self Defence Force) were hurt following a similar explosion at Fukushima Daiichi 3. They were transferred to the Fukushima Daini plant. One of the Tepco employees, complaining of pain in his side, was later transferred to hospital.The whereabouts of two Tepco workers, who had been in the turbine building of Fukushima Daiichi unit 4, is unknown. Only one casualty has been reported at the Fukushima Daini plant. A worker in the crane operating console of the exhaust stack was seriously injured when the earthquake struck. He subsequently died."
1136,GuruPrabhu,04 Apr 2011 05:23 ,"Here is something that has been bothering me. During the debate following the Indian Ocean tsunami, I heard so often that ""if only we had an advanced tsunami warning system in place, like Japan has, we would not have been hit so badly"".In this hysteria over the nuke industry, I haven't seen much about why this ""advanced tsunami warning system"" failed to warn the people. Heck, there were entire trains washed away -- why were trains running when a tsunami was coming? Or, did this ""advanced system"" not have a clue that the EQ was a massive 9.0 and hence the tsunami was likely to be massive as well?Perhaps I know the answer. By focusing all the debate on nuke power, the experts are avoiding the debate on the failure of the warning system"
1137,Bade,04 Apr 2011 09:26 ,"GuruP, the answer you seek for the success of a Tsunami warning system is a complicated function of (nature of the earthquake, distance to epicenter, population density of target area, local topography which can impede or help save lives heading to higher ground, depending on how easy it is in any given location to escape Tsunami run-ups, local height of the waves which itself is a complicated function of many things, age/agility of the population to respond in a timely fashion, etc etc. ) Well in this particular instance, the warning was issued from all available records. Whether the quantitative prediction of run-ups in the warning issued, match with what was observed is not clear yet for all locations. Well in the end, once the warning is heard only thing left is to run to the nearest highest point that one can run. Old folks stand very little chance to survive. Shorter the lead time of the warning, worse the success rate of the system."
1138,vina,04 Apr 2011 09:38 ,"""if only we had an advanced tsunami warning system in place, like Japan has, we would not have been hit so badly"".Japan would have had around half an hour warning at best or a few minutes at best.India will have around 3.5hrs warning in the worst case, more than enough to send out the warning to everyone to move out of the beaches and move to higher ground.Atleast, the tens of people who perished in Marina beach in Chennai could have easily moved to the beach road and they would have been fine."

1141,Lalmohan,04 Apr 2011 12:00 ,"japanese towns and villages do have warning systems, from a programme i saw, it suggested that mostly older people living on their own didn't evacuate promptly.  videos show many people watching the tsunami on high ground watching the wave come in.  i am sure that it was a mix of issues that led to the casualties, not just one thing.  one drawback of an aging society.  One good thing, most children were at school, and most schools have highly drilled evacuation procedures, so most of the children were savedon wave height (from the same programme, quoting a hydrology prof from oregon univ.):once a wave of a few meters hits a town, the water seeks the path of least resistance, and channels up streets.  by doing so, the 'height' and speed of the water dramatically increases as it is forced into a narrow space.  this is why a 10m wave on the sea shore ends up depositing cars on rooftops 20-30-40 meters high.  a true 38m tsunami hitting the shore is different to the water level reaching 38m in a surge in a confined space.  Vinajithanks for correcting my orificial error!  I knew even as I was typing that I was probably making a mistake.  Memory said circular, logic said square.  I let memory triumph over logic.  And i didn't have time to check wiki Shivjithe analogy is important.  engineering through history has never progressed unless there have been disasters from which to learn from.  even something as 'simple' as bridges.  we have known since ancient times that bridges collapse due to resonance from regular cyclical loads (e.g. marching soldiers), yet even in modern times we end up building bridges that resonate dangerously.  there are always new conditions that emerge that were not thought of previously.  perhaps another example might be blood transfusions before blood types were understood?All that said, the nuclear industry will definitely have to review its safety systems and procedures - and plant design will have to evolve into more fail-safe types.  Of all the things I have read over the past few weeks, the issue of managing spent fuel rods worries me the most - and yet, the amount of heat coming off these things that we dissipate also makes me think that there is more research to be done to extract useful work out of the spent fuel heatthe indications from fukushima are that its the spent fuel rods which have probably caused the most contamination - but i await the formal inquest."

1154,Theo_Fidel,04 Apr 2011 20:11 ,"My question is that the Indonesian Tsunami of 30m+ occurred in 2004. How come the Japanese did not pick up on this, knowing that a similar subduction zone runs past them. In the US for instance the entire Pacific North west re-did their Tsunami evacuation plans. Schools once thought safe have been marked for closure, new higher elevation safe zones plotted, entire towns have been evacuated in drills including removing the elderly.Yet Fukushima remained with its 5.8m Tsunami barrier. 5.8 m is very minimal. Even ocean waves in certain areas exceed this. If Kalpakkam had had a 5.8 m barrier rather that 10m it too would have been swamped.As far as fatalities, note that roughly 5 Seiverts of exposure is thought to cause a mid-term fatality. Those poor workers in the basement each got at least 3-4 Sieverts. One maybe two of them are the walking dead. They just don't know it yet. The cumulative exposure of all the workers will tell us how many will die. Similar numbers from the general population will tell us what the fatality rate long term is though there is some debate on how far to take the low level radiation limits.It is this exposure of huge numbers of general population that can cause the most fatalities. We have been very very lucky that Fukushima was so remote. Many of Japans reactors are right in the middle or next to huge cities and towns. As I have said before, we in India will not have this luxury. There are roughly 4 million people within 25 km of Koodankulam for instance. And this is a relatively empty part of India. One more thing, mid to upper levels winds around here, near Koodanakulam, tend to run from East to West. Any volatiles that get up there would be spread all over Kerala.

Some (about 20) have gotten above 100 Millisievert    None more than 250 mSv. (Limit, Japan has set for emergency)The reports of 3-4 sievert and ""walking dead"" has as much credibility as 100000000000 troops in Cashemere.. This  information is privi to postors like Sanku and Chaankaya.  After all aren't such people, still claim  that millions  died from TMI, yet nuke-lobby misleads the people and say that number is zero. (For scientifically challenged people, millisievert is thousandth of a sievert   (Think of this way, height of a person is  1-2 meter, while an ant is 1-2 millimeter)I know it will be virtually impossible to teach even the most basic physics and math to some, but for others let me put in layman's term what people mean by NTLH theory.   And how the risk is accessed in scientific world. Keep reading if interested. Stop here, if not /smile/ In nut shell the number is something like: 25Sv (whole body dose) = 1cancer death (in life time)  And they assume there is no threshold, and radiation, no matter how low, is dangerous (in a linear way as far as cancer probability is concerned)From this one gets 250 mSv (same is 25 Sv spread over 100 people) ==>   1% (increased risk of cancer)By all accounts it is serious. One may not worry about  about  extra 1%  from  personal perspective  ( as normal risk for a cancer(+ bad immune system etc), from other causes,  is about 20% over the lifespan ) . (Risk for a Javan in a war is much higher, yet we take that risk) but this translates to 10,000 deaths, in a million. So one does take it seriously.These kind of numbers for  higher doses (say above  100 mSv) is fairly understood (more than 50+ years of research, data etc), for lower radiation doses, most experts I know, do not subscribe to NTLH.  I will stop here, as discussion will become more technical. I have tried to be as accurate  as possible, yet keep it simple.  There are, of course, many places, where one can get further information."

It pays to be more familiar with radiation too.So I went around my house, with a radiation meter. You don’t have to take my word for it, just use a radiation meter, if you can get hold of it (or go to a physics lab, or a hospital etc where you have access to a radiation meter).

(Because of K40)Gas Mantle (House has an old decorative gas light we still use – but similar to kerosene lamps which are used in camping or in   a  Shadi for light): Thousands of cpm (hundreds of times of background).

(cpm  goes up in  tens of thousands..if probe is close enough)Old antique glass ( It contains about 1% Uranium). .. very high.Also, I have an old brush (to clean 35mm negatives), a duster (to clean LP records) which are very highly radioactive.

But let me assure you that I had least intention to reply  great teachers and post about tsunami, quake and fukushima nuke disaster  which are  as yet unfolding.So dear amber you were talking about annual dose.So here is the link which I quotedviewtopic.php?p=1054097#p1054097It does talk about safe annual  radiation dose limit, if you care to read enough.When one talks about workers working in different industries including industries where radiation is one of the occupational hazard,  higher limits are set. In cases of emergency  the limits are set even higher ""only"" for those who are drafted for such works and they are assumed to be aware of such doses and its attendant risk. One might like to refer to occupational hazard.When annual Radiation dose limit is talked about , the class of persons such limit applies to is strictly defined. So unless such a class is indicated it is always about General Public where consent is not required for safe annual radiation dose limits. Anything above that defined limit is problematic and public needs to be made aware of. That is why evacuation zones are set up based on such limits.Of course you would have arrogated to yourself  the reference since you thought that you are ""the competent"" person  to talk about radiation limit in mSV and others are wrong. You have not yet given the amount of radiation a person would receive in 16 days if  radiation is 3.84 mSv/hr as was reported. You might talk about whole body, living inside house or taking protective measures, but that would only serve to limit . As for annual thingy that has got you here are some reference for your enlightenment http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResource ... posure.htmNon-radiation Workers and the PublicThe dose limit to non-radiation workers and members of the public are two percent of the annual occupational dose limit. Therefore, a non-radiation worker can receive a whole body dose of no more that 0.1 rem/year from industrial ionizing radiation. This exposure would be in addition to the 0.3 rem/year from natural background radiation and the 0.05 rem/year from man-made sources such as medical x-rays. http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1994/safe-0105.htmlAverage Natural Background: 300 MilliremsThe average exposure in the United States, from natural sources of radiation (mostly cosmic radiation and radon), is 300 millirems per year at sea level. Radiation exposure is slightly higher at higher elevations-thus the exposure in Denver averages 400 millirems per year.(A milliRem is 1/1000th of a Rem. According to McGraw-Hill's Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, a Rem is a unit of ionizing radiation equal to the amount that produces the same damage to humans as one roentgen of high-voltage x-rays. The name is derived from ""Roentgen equivalent man."" Wilhelm Roentgen discovered ionizing radiation in 1895 at about the same time that Pierre and Marie Curie discovered radium.)All of these limits are for the amount of radiation exposure in addition to background radiation and medical radiation.Adult: 5,000 MilliremsThe current federal occupational limit of exposure per year for an adult (the limit for a worker using radiation) is ""as low as reasonably achievable; however, not to exceed 5,000 millirems"" above the 300+ millirems of natural sources of radiation and any medical radiation. Radiation workers wear badges made of photographic film which indicate the exposure to radiation. Readings typically are taken monthly. A federal advisory committee recommends that the lifetime exposure be limited to a person's age multiplied by 1,000 millirems (example: for a 65-year-old person, 65,000 millirems).Mind you these limits are in addition to background radiations or even banana radiations. Ooops I see, this site is from MIT.Here is another one talking about Annual  ---ooops sorry, this seems from Princeton http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/radm ... _sec_6.htmAnnual Radiation Dose Limits (top)Each worker who is monitored for external or internal radiation exposure at the University is notified about the doses he or she receives. For example, a worker who is notified that that he or she received a whole body dose of 50 millirems (mrem) and a shallow skin dose of 150 mrem during a quarter will note that this constitutes 1% and 0.3%, respectively, of the appropriate annual limits. (See the table below for a listing of the dose limits established by the state of New Jersey). And do check this one from same university.http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/osra ... imits2.htmThis one is from Canadahttp://www.mcgill.ca/ehs/radiation/manual/3/The effective dose limit for Nuclear Energy Workers, as prescribed by the CNSC, is 100 mSv (10,000 mrem) for 5 years (with a maximum of 50 mSv in any given year or an average of 20 mSv/yr for 5 years) for whole-body exposure. For Radiation Users and ""members of the public"" the corresponding limit is 1 mSv (100 mrem) per year.http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-colle ... ation.htmlAbove background levels of radiation exposure, the NRC requires that its licensees limit maximum radiation exposure to individual members of the public to 100 mrem (1mSv) per year, and limit occupational radiation exposure to adults working with radioactive material to 5,000 mrem (50 mSv) per year. NRC regulations and radiation exposure limits are contained in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20.And this is from UKhttp://www.hse.gov.uk/radiation/ionising/doses/The limits on effective dose (dose to the whole body) introduced by the IRR99 to replace the limits set previously by the IRR85 are:for employees aged 18 years or over, 20 millisieverts in a calendar year (except that in special cases employers may apply a dose limit of 100 millisieverts in 5 years with no more than 50 millisieverts in a single year, subject to strict conditions);for trainees, 6 millisieverts in a calendar year; andfor any other person, including members of the public and employees under 18 who cannot be classed as trainees, 1 millisievert in a calendar year. Well looks like ""Annual"" ""a calendar year"" etc are very much part of Radiation dose limit regulation. Also note that these limits are set over and above the natural background radiations which may vary from place to place. There are limits for internal radiations which is over and above the internal radiations from natural sources.Now, the general public is not ""Supposed to be exposed"" to a higher radiation dose exceeding the limits prescribed. As for other cases , such as x-ray, CT scan or Airport radiation or radiation due to flying or higher radiation doses for workers involved in various situations/industries using radiation, higher limits are given. The assumptions is that they are Protected by appropriate safety protocols,  aware of the risk and willing to take that risk, and benefits outweighs the risk  etc.Now one may be able to note , if not common sensically challenged , that current dose is 1 mSv per annum over and above the natural radiation.  While in 1927 it was equivalent of 1000 mSV. One need not quote Tajmahal as several units are devised later but can easily be worked backward and see the equivalent dose limit.I have seen persistent attempt to misinform the members and mis-represent the facts or misinterpret the posts and obfuscate the postings in order to divert the attention from the various issues raised.  I have least time and patience to reply to such  attempts that too coming from a supposedly esteemed member of teaching community for whom I have but highest regard.Perhaps you would be so gracious to tell us if dumping of radiaoactive water in sea is an appropriate or approved  means of disposal. What would be reaction in USA.One can say this easily. But then I see they also talk about ""annual ""   oops..ccording to the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, even if one eats 200 grams of fish caught within a 1-km radius of the Fukushima plant each day, the cumulative radiation exposure over a year would amount to 0.6 millisieverts, which is below the 1.0 millisieverts recommended in one year.Of course one has pointed to highly beneficial effects of radiation ( other than industrial and medical use) on biological forms including humans with ideas such as hearium and radiation tonic alluded to in earlier posts.viewtopic.php?p=1055127#p1055127 and here Preparations containing Radium, sold as part of the magical new age, as the elixir of life, became incorporated into a wide range of nostrums. There were Radium-containing general tonics, hair restorers, toothpastes and cures for all ills from arthritis to infertility. A hearing-aid was marketed with the magic ingredient, `hearium'. One most popular and widely used preparation was `Radium water', often referred to as `liquid sunshine'. One company in New York claimed to supply 150,000 customers with radium water. Another brand, `radithor' was so radioactive that several users died from Radium poisoning. One of these, a Pittsburgh industrialist and amateur golf champion, Eben Byers, drank a two-ounce bottle daily for several years; he believed it made him fit, and pressed it on his friends. He died of multiple decay of the jawbone, anaemia and a brain abscess in 1932. And yes I will continue to post  as long as I am not told not to. If that bothers you, that is your problem."

(CNNMoney) -- Environmental Defense Fund President Fred Krupp came out swinging at this year's FORTUNE Brainstorm Green conference, forcefully calling out Exxon (XOM, Fortune 500), Big Oil, the coal industry and lawmakers on Capitol Hill for their efforts to weaken the Environmental Protection Agency's power.""Never in four decades has there ever been this brazen assault on the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to protect our health,"" said Krupp. ""In the House they've already passed an amendment that would mean the EPA couldn't enforce its effort to clean mercury from the air.""The EPA has been ordered by the courts to regulate greenhouse gases after the agency ruled that they are a danger to public health.Some lawmakers, from both sides of the aisle, are scrambling to strip the EPA of this power, and even roll back some of its other regulatory responsibilities. They are concerned that regulating greenhouse gases will be too costly.Krupp said that Exxon has been pushing its employees and even its retired employees to ask Washington to weaken the EPA because it's afraid of being forced to clean up its emissions. He called that the industry's biggest subsidy.""Exxon wants that this big loophole of not having to clean up its emissions to continue,"" he said. ""That's the biggest subsidy for the oil companies, that's the biggest subsidy for the coal companies, the fact that they're not required to have their products burn cleanly.""Exxon disagreed with Krupp's characterization of the company's motivation but said that EPA should not be taking the lead in regulating greenhouse gases.""EPA plays a vital role in protecting our nation's health and environment, and these proposals do not prevent the EPA from addressing harmful air pollution,"" said Allan Jeffries, an Exxon spokesman. ""However, Congress, not EPA, is the appropriate body to address comprehensive U.S. energy and climate policy.""Fortune's Brainstorm Green conference comes amid the ongoing nuclear tragedy in Japan and with the one-year anniversary of BP's Gulf of Mexico disaster around the corner. Those two events have left many wondering about our energy alternatives. The coal mafia in India is not far behind in screwing the public interest."

The amount of compensation payable is Rs. 4 lakh in case of death and Rs. 32000 to Rs. 4 lakh in case of injury depending upon the gravity of the injury, which is decided by Railway Claims Tribunal (RCT) after a claim for compensation is filed in RCT.The amount of compensation paid by the Railways for death/injury of passengers in train accidents during last three years is Rs. 121.37 lakh in 2007-08, Rs. 218.94 lakh in 2008-09 and Rs. 265.81 lakh during 2009-10.In case of death/injury in train accident, it is the responsibility of the Indian Railways under the Railways Act, 1989 to pay compensation as decreed by the Railway Claims Tribunal. The insurance cover bought from general insurers is an internal mechanism to get the reimbursement of the compensation paid by the Railways to the claimants. Payment of compensation to the victims of train accidents does not get affected whether insurance cover is available or otherwise.This information was given by the Minister of State for Railways, Shri K.H.

The utility known as TEPCO aims to dispose of a total of 11,500 tons of low-level tainted water by this weekend.By noon Tuesday, an estimated 3,430 tons of such low radioactive water had been discharged into the Pacific Ocean from the plant on the coast, TEPCO said.Industry minister Banri Kaieda maintained that contamination of the sea to be caused by the disposal will pose no major health risk, but apologized for raising concerns among the public, especially fishermen.The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said the 60,000 tons of water -- 20,000 tons each from the Nos. 1-3 reactor buildings and trenches -- will be stored in tanks at the units, a facility for nuclear waste disposal at the site, an artificial floating island called a ''megafloat,'' U.S. Navy barges and provisional tanks.The complex for nuclear waste disposal can accommodate 30,000 tons of such water but it will take a while before it can store the liquid because TEPCO will try to ensure that radioactive water will not be leaked from the facility by using coating agents, the agency said.The provisional tanks will be shipped to the Fukushima plant by the end of this month, it added.Meanwhile, TEPCO began work Tuesday afternoon to stop the leakage into the sea of highly radioactive water believed to be originating from the No. 2 reactor's core, where fuel rods have partially melted.The water containing radioactive iodine-131 more than 10,000 times the legal concentration limit has been leaking from a cracked seaside pit connected to the No. 2 reactor turbine building.In a new finding, TEPCO said Tuesday a seawater sample taken Saturday near the No. 2 reactor's water intake showed the iodine-131 concentration at 7.5 million times the maximum allowable level under law.To halt the radioactive water flow, the operator will inject ''water glass'' or sodium silicate into graveled areas beneath the pit's bottom, where radioactive water is believed to be seeping through, according to the agency.The utility has tried to block the radioactive water leakage with concrete and water-absorbing polymeric materials, but its efforts have so far been unsuccessful.TEPCO has also poured in white bath agents to trace the route of the leakage but colored water did not emerge from the seaside pit, leaving the path of contamination unknown."

1208,Sanku,05 Apr 2011 12:07 ,"http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/03/24 ... almia-1-2/Glowing endorsementJapan has pushed nuclear energy hard — at the expense of safetyTo get there, Japan has poured lavish subsidies into nuclear, starting with research. Around 65 percent of Japan’s energy research budget goes toward nuclear — the highest of any country — with the industry spending $250 million, well below 10 percent of what the government spends. Even France, which gets 80 percent of its energy from nuclear, spends three-and-half times less than Japan.Beyond research, the government offers the nuclear energy industry loans that are a full percentage point below commercial levels. And for four decades, Japan has taxed the utility bills of electricity consumers, distributing the proceeds to communities willing to house nuclear plants. In essence, nuclear’s competitors are being forced to act against their own interest to bribe local communities to accept a risk against the communities' interest.But the mother of all subsidies is the liability cap that nuclear enjoys. In the event of an accident, the industry is on the hook for only $1.2 billion in damages, with the government covering everything beyond that. Japan’s cap is generous even by American standards, which require the industry to cover $12.6 billion before Uncle Sam kicks in. (Nuclear proponents in the U.S. argue that this liability cap is necessary given our insane tort awards. However, the fact that even countries without such awards have to offer a liability cap suggests that nuclear technology is not yet considered safe enough to be viable.)In light of the above India should immediately upgrade its Liability amount."

Of course this assumes he is discerning in his choices and just doesn't post the first link he gets. The last one was some maverick geologist who said elsewhere that the nuclear accident was a deliberate nuclear attack on America's food supply. It's there on this thread, I've posted the relevant links. Regarding the last link which he quoted to say that the liability cap should be raised was written by a pretty lady (she is good looking, ask Gogal cacha, as good as the Lal Chicks) named Shikha Dalmia.I did a bit prodding around and I came across a very interesting link. In an article titled The heart of the problem James Hrynyshyn quotes the same article and has added his thoughts.Some excerpts:No one is more surprised than I to see something worthwhile reading in The Daily, Rupert Murdoch's iPad magazine. You might even be forgiven for suspecting an April Fool.This is priceless. However, it may be lost on Sanku bhai.Dalmia's indictment goes far beyond the nuclear industry, though. Intended or not, it strikes at the heart of the economic philosophy that dominates pretty much the entire planet To wit:    The liability cap effectively privatizes the profits of nuclear and socializes the risk.Liability caps are just one of many tools that serve to privatize profits and shift risk onto the public. Without the protection afforded the industry by governments everywhere, it is doubtful a single private-sector nuclear reactor would be splitting atoms anywhere. But the nuclear industry is nothing special. Only in the past few years have a few jurisdictions cottoned on to the reality that the combustion of fossil fuels does exactly the same thing. The owners of coal-, gas- and oil-fired power plants reaps the profits, but the rest of the planet must deal with the consequences and risks -- the millions of people that end up in hospital and graves from the pollution and myriad other species that suffer untold fates from habitat destruction and toxification. Putting a price on carbon emissions is a small step in the right direction, one that has yet to be taken at the federal level in North America or China, which collectively are responsible for half of world's total emissions.Now we have folks here arguing that fossil fuel is cheaper because even if there's an accident it would be nothing like a nuclear accident. That's true to a certain extent but how about what happens when there's no accident in fossil fuel run power plants?. What about the millions of people who end up in hospital as the quote above says?So taking this line of reasoning further, damned if we do damned if we don't. We suffer the consequences if there's a nuclear accident (btw the numbers of deaths from nuclear is far less). And we suffer if there's no accident in fossil fuel plants.We have made no serious efforts at reform to prevent another financial crisis. What are the chances of making substantial reforms to the nuclear industry? Or the fossil-fuel industry? The fact is, if we did redistribute profit and risk everywhere it is out of whack, the face of capitalism would be unrecognizable. That face wouldn't allow the concentration of capital in so few hands because they wouldn't have the strength to carry the risk.And here's the most interesting para:This is why so many people deny the facts of climatology and the need to change our ways. Not because the science is uncertain. (Uncertainty is the hallmark of good science) Not because climatologists are all in on some New World Order socialist conspiracy. (Scientists prosper by undermining their colleague's theories, not participating in group-think. And besides, how do you explain Republican climatolgists?) Not because Al Gore is a hypocrite (What would that have to do with anything?) Not because the world was warmer 1000 years ago. (It wasn't). Not because the sun is to blame. (It isn't). Because reversing the inexorable rise in global average temperatures will require a new way of organizing our economies, one that scares the captains of industry far more than the spectre of rising sea levels, desertification, and ocean acidification scare the rest of us.Bottomline folks, its not a zero sum game. Less nuclear does not equal to better health, less harm. As I've written before, in terms of analogy, nuclear accidents are like plane crashes - gruesome and deadly. But in terms of probability of being involved in an accident it's probably safer to travel by plane from say Mumbai to New Delhi than it is to travel by road.We can't ignore nuclear power and the IMO the biggest takeaway from this tragic accident is not nuclear is a NO, NO but rather it is possible and imperative to design as many safety features as possible in future nuclear plants that we build. By we of course I mean India."

1221,chaanakya,05 Apr 2011 17:46 ,"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/MD05Dh01.htmlFukushima is indeed a setback to Nuclear Industry as a whole.It has forced many serious thinkers to consider various issues plaguing the industry just when it was supposed to be coming out of the aftermath of TML and Cher.Despite this resentment towards nuclear technology, Japan was forced to expand nuclear power generation after the two oil shocks in the 1970s, which exposed Japan's heavy reliance on the Middle East for energy resources. Petroleum provided about 60% of the whole nation's electricity in 1970, but now it only provides about 10%. Japan imports 99% of its oil from abroad. Although Japan aimed to reduce the dependency rate on petroleum from the Middle East after the oil shocks, it still imports nearly 90% of oil from the Middle East. The Fukushima plant will be decommissioned and no local government or community is likely to accept the building of a new nuclear power plant in their area now. The Fukushima incident will be a severe setback for Japan's nuclear fuel cycle, Endo said. The nuclear fuel cycle starts with the mining of uranium and ends with the disposal of nuclear waste. With the reprocessing of used fuel, the stages form a true cycle. Japan has been implemented this program since 1956, according to Endo. However, the nation has been unable to locate a site for a second nuclear reprocessing plant after the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant of Aomori Prefecture, which managed to escape damage from the March 11 earthquake.

The values for iodine-131 ranged from 2.4 to 82, for cesium-137 from 5.2 to 57 becquerel per square metre. On 4th April, deposition of iodine-131 was detected in 7 prefectures ranging from 3.1 to 75 becquerel per square metre. Deposition of cesium-137 in 6 prefectures ranging from 7.4 to 46 becquerel per square metre. Reported gamma dose rates in the 46 prefectures showed no significant changes compared to yesterday.As of 3rd April, iodine-131 and cesium-134/137 was detectable in 8 and 5 prefectures respectively. All values were well below levels that would trigger recommendations for restrictions of drinking water. As of 3rd April, restrictions for infants related to I-131 (100 Bq/l) are in place in only one village of the Fukushima prefecture. The restriction is still in place as a precautionary measure.Currently, the IAEA monitoring team is working in the Fukushima region. On 5th April, measurements were made at 7 locations at distances of 16 to 41 km, South and South West to the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The dose rates ranged from 0.3 to 31 microsievert per hour. At the same locations, results of beta-gamma contamination measurements ranged from 0.01 to 3.2 megabecquerel per square metre. The highest dose rates and beta gamma contaminations were measured at the location closest to the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant.Seawater is collected daily close to the discharge areas of Units 1 - 4 and of Units 5 and 6 at the Dai-ichi NPP. The data show a decreasing trend from 1 to 3 April from about 66 kBq/l to 24 kBq/l for I-131 and 21 kBq/l to 10 kBq/l for both Cs-134 and Cs-137 at Units 1-4. The concentrations at Units 5 and 6 also showed a decreasing trend until 3 April. These values were measured before the discharge of low level contaminated water authorised by the Japanese Government on the 4th April.New data were provided for the off-shore survey on 8 sampling points about 30 km east of the NPPs. Concentrations are between 5 and 18 Bq/l for I-131 and between roughly 1 and 11 Bq/l for Cs-137. For the new coverage of the coastal transect in the south, about 35 km south of Fukushima Daiini, the highest concentrations were detected at the sampling point closest to the coast in the south with about 38 Bq/l for I-131 and 4.5 Bq/l for Cs-137.

However, Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) still needs to pump contaminated water into the sea because of a lack of storage space at the facility. "
1240,abhishek_sharma,06 Apr 2011 06:54 ,"Fukushima update: TEPCO forced to deliberately pollute ocean with radioisotopes - April 04, 2011http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2011/04/fukushima_update_tepco_forced.htmlA quick wrap-up of some developments from today and over the weekend:TEPCO deliberately dumps more than 10,000 tonnes of radioactive water into sea. TEPCO, the operator of the Fukushima power plant has today begun deliberately discharging radioactive water into the sea. The company says it was forced to dump what it describes as low-level radioactive water (though I haven't seen any figures on radiation levels) in order to make room in storage tanks for highly radioactive water that is flooding the basement of the turbine buildings of reactor 2. It also intends to dump a further 1,500 tonnes of contaminated groundwater into the sea tonight. The surprise move comes after the company last weekend found a large crack that was allowing highly radioactive water to pour from flooded buildings in reactor 2 into the ocean. This seems to explain the very high and increasing radiation levels detected last week just off the coast from the plant. Efforts to seal the leak have been unsuccessful so far. I imagine this might explain why the company is taking drastic action to dump less radioactive water so that it can quickly pump out the more dangerous flood water. TEPCO, like BP during last year's Gulf oil spill, increasingly seems to be improvising as it goes along.Japanese government says it may be months before fallout stops. That's what Yukio Edano, chief cabinet secretary told a news conference Sunday.Debate continues over reactor damage US Energy Secretary Steven Chu estimates that 70% of the core of reactor 1 may be damaged. Meanwhile other nuclear engineers are studying the radionuclide composition of emissions from the plant, and key plant parameters to come up with their own assessments – see here and here. There have also been some reports of authorities planning to inject nitrogen into the reactors to avert hydrogen explosions. Meanwhile, the IAEA reported today that external power has been restored to the coolant systems of reactors 1 to 3Food update From that same IAEA briefing today, here's the latest on food testing:""Since our written briefing of 1st April 2011, significant data related to food contamination was reported on 1st April (33 samples), 2nd April (64 samples) and 3rd April (37 samples) by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. These reported analytical results covered a total of 134 samples taken on 15 March (2 samples), 29-31 March (77 samples) and 1st - 2nd April (55 samples). Analytical results for 133 of the 134 samples for various vegetables, spinach and other leafy vegetables, mushrooms, fruit (strawberry), various meats (beef and pork), seafood and unprocessed raw milk in twelve prefectures (Chiba, Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Kanagawa, Kyoto, Niigata, Saitama, Shizuoka, Tchigi, Tochigi, and Tokyo), indicated that iodine-131, caesium-134 and/or caesium-137 were either not detected or were below the regulation values set by the Japanese authorities. One sample of shiitake mushrooms taken on 1st April in Fukushima prefecture was above the regulation values set by the Japanese authorities for both iodine-131 and caesium-134/caesium-137.""Mushrooms are a new addition to the list of contaminated edibles. Scientists I've spoken to can't emphasize enough that food and drinks are by far the largest radiation threat to human health, much more than the low levels of environmental radiation, which most reckon poses no health risk outside of the 20km evacuation zone around the plant.""For full coverage of the Fukushima disaster, go to Nature's news special.

1241,abhishek_sharma,06 Apr 2011 06:56 ,"Fukushima health risks scrutinizedhttp://www.nature.com/news/2011/110405/full/472013a.htmlEven as the damaged reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station continue to leak radiation, researchers have begun laying the groundwork for studies that will look for any long-term effects on public health.Academic scientists face major obstacles as they try to collate baseline data on radiation doses in the face of the enormous disruption caused by the earthquake and tsunami that hit the country last month. But the experience of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident shows that such baseline data are vital. Without them, drawing firm conclusions about any adverse health effects will be much more difficult.Researchers emphasize, however, that environmental levels of radiation outside the 20-kilo­metre evacuation zone around the power plant are currently far below levels that warrant concerns about human health. The greatest threat to human health from the disaster is consuming contaminated food and drink, they say.Assessing the impact of any exposure to radiation in the environment may require cohort studies to look for a raised incidence of cancers years from now among people living in regions with raised levels of contamination. Just how far-reaching those studies need to be, or whether they are needed at all, will depend on the extent of the ongoing contamination from the damaged reactors. Although the prevailing winds are blowing the bulk of radio­isotopes from the plant out over the Pacific Ocean, periodic changes in weather patterns are dumping fallout inland, increasing the doses that residents receive. The Japanese authorities acknowledged last week that it may be months before the reactors are brought under control. For now, ""it is difficult to predict what the health effects might be"", says Dillwyn Williams, a cancer researcher at the Strangeways Research Laboratory in Cambridge, UK.Plant workers are being exposed to much higher levels of radiation than the general population, and will be monitored for long-term health effects. The Tokyo-based Radiation Effects Association already has an ongoing study of the health of Japanese nuclear-power workers, and new dosimetric data for Fukushima workers will be merged into that study.“The problem is that it is very difficult to get a real picture of the exposure of the population.”But the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), based in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which is responsible for radiation epidemiology studies on survivors of atomic-bomb explosions, is already initiating discussions on broader Fukushima studies. In a joint statement to Nature (see go.nature.com/cckfoe), the RERF's vice-chairman and chief of research Roy Shore, and Kotaro Ozasa, its head of epidemiology, say that it is vital to gather baseline data — such as the exact locations of people exposed to fallout — as soon as possible. Several agencies, including Japan's science ministry, local authorities and the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the plant's operator, are already publishing measurements. But compiling and evaluating the information will be a challenge, say Shore and Ozasa, as these data are currently ""scattered and uncoordinated"".""The problem is that it is very difficult to get a real picture of the exposure of the population,"" says Elisabeth Cardis, a radiation epidemiologist at the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain. A critical review of all the available data is desperately needed, she says (see go.nature.com/ejlpny).Questionnaires should also be sent to people in higher-risk areas to identify details such as the time spent outdoors on various dates, and what food and water were consumed, say Shore and Ozasa. ""Obviously, it is important to obtain those data sooner rather than later, but at this point, coping with the huge effects of the earthquake and tsunami has to take precedence,"" their statement says.Japan's prompt evacuation of the 20-kilometre zone around Fukushima, and bans on suspect produce, should have helped to curb exposure to isotopes of concern. Iodine-131, which has a half-life of just 8 days but accumulates quickly in the thyroid gland, is still the major component of the emissions from the nuclear plant and remains the greatest acute radiation health threat to the public, says Richard Wake­ford, an epidemiologist at the Dalton Nuclear Institute, University of Manchester, UK. Some of the radioactivity levels detected in food since the accident have been ""pretty hefty"", he adds.One of the largest health impacts from Chernobyl has been the 6,000 or more cases of thyroid cancer, mostly affecting people who were children at the time of the accident. In most of these cases, people received high radiation doses through drinking milk from cows that had grazed on iodine-contaminated pasture. Children are particularly at risk because their thyroids are still developing and are more prone to radiation damage than adults' mature thyroids.The Japanese authorities are distributing potassium iodide tablets in affected areas, and Williams says that this is a crucial precaution. The tablets swamp the thyroid with non-radioactive iodine, preventing uptake of the radioactive form. Japanese children may also have a cultural advantage that lowers their risk from radioiodine. Whereas the children of Chernobyl tended to be iodine-deficient, the Japanese diet, rich in fish and seaweed, is ""one of the most iodine-rich diets in the world"", says Williams. Milk is also far less important in the Japanese diet than it was for the rural populations around Chernobyl.Radioiodine doses in the thyroids of children in the most contaminated areas are already being monitored by the Japanese authorities. Nature has learned that the first results of that survey show minimal thyroid doses in 946 children living in areas northwest of the plant, a region where some of the highest fallout over land has been reported. Measurements during 28–30 March found maximum doses of 0.07 microsieverts per hour. This would suggest that the children had received total doses of less than 100 microsieverts, many thousands of times lower than was received by people living in contaminated areas around Chernobyl. The results ""seem reassuring that not much iodine-131 has got into children"", says Wake­ford, adding that if the food bans are being effective, ""Japan will have got a grip on what is the major concern in this sort of situation"".Vadim Chumak, a health physicist at the Research Center for Radiation Medicine at the Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine in Kiev, who has coordinated Chernobyl health studies, says that Japanese radiation researchers should heed a key lesson from that disaster. Dose data are fleeting, he warns, and if they are not collected now, any eventual research would be much more prone to uncertainty. Dosimetric monitoring after Chernobyl was sub-standard, he says, ""so in our research we had to invest enormous time and effort in the retrospective estimation of doses"" "
1242,abhishek_sharma,06 Apr 2011 07:03 ,"Japan faces more than a decade of nuclear clean-up: Experts fear that damage to the Fukushima reactors is worse than partial meltdown.http://www.nature.com/news/2011/012345/full/news.2011.211.htmlIt came as no surprise when the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) admitted last week that it will scrap its stricken Fukushima Daiichi reactors. After explosions, copious radioisotope leaks and a liberal dousing with sea water, it has been clear for weeks that the reactors were a write-off. But just what will workers encounter when they finally start decommissioning the shattered plant?It may be years before the true state of the reactors is known and a full clean-up can begin. But already scientists have been piecing together a picture of what happened inside the reactors from fragmentary and sometimes incorrect data about pressure, radiation levels and most of all the radioisotopes leaking from the plant.After the tsunami on 11 March knocked out backup generators — preventing cooling water from circulating around the hot cores of reactors 1–3 — the fuel rods inside began to warp, split and at least partially melt. Steam reacted with the rods' outer sheath of zirconium, creating hydrogen gas that caused a sequence of massive explosions (see Nature 471, 417–418; 2011).But data from Japanese regulators and TEPCO suggest to some researchers that conditions inside the core could be far worse than a partial meltdown. Some believe that molten fuel may have flowed into the outer concrete containment vessel, whereas others suggest that nuclear chain reactions are still happening inside the fuel.Radiation leaksThe most worrisome evidence comes from water found in a building next to reactor 1. On 26 March, Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency reported the presence of chlorine-38, a radioisotope with a half-life of just 37 minutes. The short-lived isotope, which forms when natural chlorine-37 is hit by neutrons from fission, could be evidence that fuel inside the reactor has clumped together into sufficiently large chunks to briefly restart nuclear reactions, says Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress, a physicist at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California. Such bursts could put workers at extreme risk of radiation exposure during clean-up, he warns, and seriously complicate work at the site.But Paddy Regan, a nuclear physicist at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK, is sceptical. Other radioisotopes have a similar γ-ray spectrum and could be mimicking chlorine-38, he says. Indeed, in the same week as the reading was taken, TEPCO reported alarmingly high levels of iodine-134, a similarly short-lived isotope, before retracting the announcement soon after. Dalnoki-Veress agrees that the evidence is circumstantial, adding that he is frustrated by the lack of clear data coming from the plant.Other theories also rest on tentative evidence. Richard Lahey, an emeritus professor of nuclear engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, believes that the core of reactor 2 may have melted its control rods, which are designed to stop nuclear reactions. Pressure readings and high levels of radioactivity suggest to him that molten fuel has flowed through the control-rod system like lava and dripped into the containment vessel below. If this had happened, clean-up would be far more difficult.Wiktor Frid, a researcher at the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority in Stockholm thinks the tops of the control rods themselves may have melted. This would allow nuclear chain reactions to restart each time the reactor is filled with water, which slows neutrons sufficiently to allow fission. Simulations conducted by Frid and his colleagues have hinted that such an event is possible. But Frid is quick to add that the data he has seen may not be reliable. ""A lot of information is missing and some is contradictory,"" he says.Pennsylvanian precedentThe confusion recalls the weeks that followed the partial meltdown of a reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979. In the immediate aftermath of that emergency, the state of the reactor core was subject to ""an ongoing debate that went on for months"", recalls Jack DeVine, an independent nuclear consultant who spent six years cleaning up that accident.Many scientists believed that the fuel rods at Three Mile Island were more-or-less intact, on the basis of computer models and simulations, says DeVine. But when a camera was eventually lowered into the core in 1982, the damage was far worse than anyone had predicted. ""It looked like my gravel driveway — a mess,"" he says. Engineers hoping to remove fuel rods in a process akin to conventional decommissioning of a nuclear core had to rethink their clean-up strategies, though they eventually managed to clear most of the fuel out of the reactor.DeVine says that the Japanese authorities should have no desire to shroud Fukushima's reactors in a protective concrete sarcophagus like the one built over the exploded Chernobyl reactor in 1986. The risk of another earthquake or tsunami damaging the structure and creating more problems would be too great. Instead, Fukushima's fuel will have to be removed in a process similar to Three Mile Island's recovery.That effort took 14 years. Based on what he has seen so far, DeVine believes that one thing is certain: decommissioning Fukushima will probably take longer.  "
1243,Amber G.,06 Apr 2011 07:13 ,"IAEA Website:Japan Begins Discharge of Low Level Radioactive WaterJapanese authorities have confirmed to the IAEA that they began to discharge 11,500 tonnes of low level radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea on 4 April. The operation is being conducted to create storage capacity for highly radioactive water that has pooled in parts of the reactor facility, hindering efforts to restore electrical power from the grid to the facility.Japanese officials have reported that they plan to release 10,000 tonnes of water from a waste treatment facility and 1,500 tonnes from drainage pits around reactor Units 5 and 6. The operation is expected to last no more than five days.For dose etc from:http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS_Large_release_of_water_0404111.htmlow, the Japanese government has approved Tepco's plan to move the most contaminated water to the central radioactive waste treatment facility. This means that the stocks of water already present there have to be displaced, taking with them low levels of radioactivity. Some 10,000 tonnes of this will be allowed to enter the sea, Tepco said, as well as 1500 tonnes from the sub drain pits of units 5 and 6. Subsurface water is running into the buildings of those units and Tepco said this could eventually affect safety equipment. The company calculates that a person who ate fish and seaweed from the nearby sea every day would have an additional radiation dose of 0.6 millisieverts per year, but did not say how long this would continue. The additiona dose compares to the 2.4 millisieverts people receive from natural sources each year.From AS post above:Mushrooms are a new addition to the list of contaminated edibles.

In the model being run by French researchers, the powerful Kuroshiro current—the Pacific's version of the Gulf Stream—tends to block contaminated seawater from flowing southward toward Tokyo Bay while picking up little contamination itself.Figuring out where Fukushima radioactivity is going involves all the complexities and uncertainties that plagued early efforts to model the meanderings of oil last summer in the Gulf of Mexico, and then some, says ocean modeler Claude Estournel. She is a member of the SIROCCO group at the University of Toulouse in France running the SYMPHONIE-NH ocean model under the auspices of the French national research agency CNRS. The International Atomic Energy Agency requested that the group run its model centered on the Fukushima plant on the coast northeast of Tokyo. The resulting daily simulations posted on the Web are rife with uncertainties, Estournel cautions, so that the group is presenting only ""scenarios of dispersion"" that provide an ""orders of magnitude"" idea of the actual amounts of radionuclides in the sea.Caveats aside, the modeling is strongly confirming oceanographers' intuition. The highest concentrations in the model are still within 5 kilometers or so of shore but have been carried up to 50 kilometers north and south by wind-driven currents. That contamination was released directly into the sea.Radionuclides first released into the atmosphere only to fall into the sea are 20 to 100 times less concentrated but spread more widely, spanning 600 kilometers along the shore and reaching 150 kilometers offshore. In the model, concentrations are 1000 times lower than near Fukushima in the Kuroshiro as it shears off the southern extent of contamination and heads east into the Pacific. The modeling will guide Japanese authorities as they scramble to sample the expanse of ocean liable to contamination. "

The document also suggests that fragments or particles of nuclear fuel from spent fuel pools above the reactors were blown “up to one mile from the units,” and that pieces of highly radioactive material fell between two units and had to be “bulldozed over,” presumably to protect workers at the site. The ejection of nuclear material, which may have occurred during one of the earlier hydrogen explosions, may indicate more extensive damage to the extremely radioactive pools than previously disclosed. The assessment provides graphic new detail on the conditions of the damaged cores in reactors 1, 2 and 3. Because slumping fuel and salt from seawater that had been used as a coolant is probably blocking circulation pathways, the water flow in No. 1 “is severely restricted and likely blocked.” Inside the core itself, “there is likely no water level,” the assessment says, adding that as a result, “it is difficult to determine how much cooling is getting to the fuel.” Similar problems exist in No. 2 and No. 3, although the blockage is probably less severe, the assessment says. Margaret Harding, a former reactor designer for General Electric, warned of aftershocks and said, “If I were in the Japanese’s shoes, I’d be very reluctant to have tons and tons of water sitting in a containment whose structural integrity hasn’t been checked since the earthquake.” "

Another is a processing facility for nuclear waste from the plant's No. 1 through 4 reactors. TEPCO also plans to construct makeshift water tanks. It says that using all three options, it should be able to store more than 60,000 tons of wastewater.But about 500 tons of fresh water is injected into reactor buildings each day to cool down the reactors. Some of the water is believed to be leaking outside after becoming contaminated.This means the total amount of radioactive wastewater in the compound could exceed the currently estimated 50,000 tons, requiring more storage space.Wednesday, April 06, 2011 19:50 +0900 (JST)"

1271,chaanakya,06 Apr 2011 18:30 ,"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/MD07Dh01.htmlWe can only speculate at this point about the precise effects. Previously, marine ecosystems were thought to be relatively invulnerable to the release of radiation. According to the Science Insider:Radioactive isotopes are most dangerous when animals' bodies absorb them, thinking they're something else. For instance, cesium-137 mimics potassium and is absorbed by muscles, while strontium-90 mimics calcium and is taken up by bones. Since ocean water is full of potassium and calcium in the form of salts, this lowers the chance of an animal's body taking up radioactive particles by mistake. Furthermore, since the Pacific is so massive, radioactivity will be diluted to levels far too low to be toxic to aquatic life. A much bigger concern is the plume blowing over land and contaminating plant life or the freshwater supply, which would affect animals (including humans) further up the food chain.Now, however, high levels of radiation are being found in fish as well, and many countries have banned Japanese seafood imports. On Tuesday, India became the first country to ban all food imports from Japan for three months. "

TEPCO officials submitted the water discharge plan to the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency and received its approval.An NISA official said the TEPCO decision was ""unavoidable.""According to TEPCO officials who calculated the effects from the water discharged, even if an individual ate fish and seaweed taken at least 1 kilometer from the Fukushima plant on a daily basis for a year, the amount of radiation ingested would only be one-fourth of the natural radiation exposure over the course of a year of 2.4 millisieverts.TEPCO officials said 10,000 tons of water would be discharged from the central waste processing facility.Once the water has been discharged, highly contaminated water at the basement of the turbine building for the No. 2 reactor would be moved to the waste processing facility.In addition, 1,500 tons of groundwater stored around the No. 5 and No. 6 reactors will also be released into the ocean to prevent the water seeping from the ground from flooding important equipment in those reactors, such as emergency generators.The contaminated water at the No. 2 reactor turbine building contains radioactive iodine at levels of several million becquerels per cubic centimeter.In contrast, the water in the central waste processing facility has a radioactivity level of 6.3 becquerels while the water from the No. 5 reactor has a radioactivity level of 1.6 becquerels and the water from the No. 6 reactor 20 becquerels.While the radiation levels of the water to be discharged into the ocean are similar to contaminated rainfall around the Fukushima plant, they are still 100 times the standard for radiation levels in seawater as defined by the reactor regulation law.The total amount of radioactivity that will be discharged into the ocean will be 170 billion becquerels.While that may seem like a lot, the radioactivity level in 10,000 tons of the discharged water is equivalent to about 10 liters of contaminated water accumulated at the basement of the No. 2 reactor.The highly contaminated water in the No. 2 reactor turbine building is slowing work to restore a cooling mechanism that would be necessary to eventually achieve a cold shutdown of the reactor core.One idea initially considered was moving the contaminated water into the central waste processing facility, but the facility was flooded by the tsunami following the March 11 Great East Japan Earthquake.An attempt to move the water in the waste processing facility to another location failed.The water is believed to have been contaminated from radioactive materials that spread from the Fukushima plant.The reactor buildings and turbine buildings were also flooded by the tsunami because the buildings were located near the coastline.Although the contamination levels of the water to be discharged are low, there will inevitably be effects on the environment.TEPCO workers are still a long way from stable cooling of three reactors. And water contaminated by high levels of radiation continues to leak from the No. 2 reactor, where its containment vessel is believed to have been damaged.The No. 1 reactor still requires careful calibration of the water pumped into the core because the relative airtightness of the core has led to fluctuations in core pressure.The temperature in the No. 1 reactor core reached about 400 degrees on March 23. While the temperature has since fallen, it was still 234 degrees as of 6 a.m. Tuesday.Pipes to the pressure container of the No. 2 reactor have been damaged, so there is the possibility that core pressure is dropping as a result. That has, in turn, made it easier for water to be pumped in, which likely led to a decrease in the temperature, some experts said.However, the water that overflows from the reactor is believed to have leaked onto the plant grounds."
1275,chaanakya,06 Apr 2011 18:48 ,Interesting Idea of Sea fenceTEPCO officials are now considering dropping a fence into the ocean to prevent the spread of contaminated water.The idea being contemplated is to lower a silt fence into the water. Silt fences are used in civil engineering projects to prevent the spread of polluted water. The fence is suspended from a float and extends to the seabed like a curtain and is designed to limit the movement of seawater.The water off the coast of the Fukushima No. 1 plant has a depth of between five to six meters. One idea being considered is to install the fence near the seawater intake from where contaminated water is flowing as well as near embankments that surround the waters off the plant site.
1276,chaanakya,06 Apr 2011 18:53 ,"Radiation fallout from Fukushima plant will take ""months"" to stopOfficials of Tokyo Electric Power Co., the plant operator, want to restore the normal cooling system that would cool both the reactor core and the storage tanks holding the spent fuel rods. Doing so would allow sufficient water to cool the core down to under 100 degrees, at which point it would reach a cold shutdown. The core and storage pool would then become stable and there would be no danger of radioactive materials leaking to the atmosphere through hydrogen explosions, and also no need for water to be pumped into the core.The time frame of several months given by Hosono is believed to be the time needed to achieve a cold shutdown, but reaching that stage will not be easy. The first task is to remove the contaminated water that has accumulated in the basements of the turbine buildings, which are next to the reactor buildings.The process, which involves moving water to various pools within the plant ground, is already under way, but it is expected to take at least a week. TEPCO workers want to move the contaminated water in the basements to condensers in the No. 1 to No. 3 reactors. However, the three condensers were already filled with water, so they had to first take that water out and transfer it to the suppression pool storage tanks. This stage has now been completed.The next step is to move the water from the condensers to their respective condensation storage tanks. This is under way for the No. 1 and No. 2 reactors, and preparations are being made to start on the No. 3 reactor, with the whole process expected to be finished in a few days. After that, the transfer of the contaminated water can finally begin.Once the water is removed, radiation levels within the buildings will have to be measured to determine if workers can enter to begin the next step"

Putting the used fuel pool up top with just a simple roof over it was a bad idea. The design of a sheet metal venting duct, which leaked the Hydrogen and caused the explosions was another design issue. So much of the piping was placed underground where it broke during the earthquake. This was a significant problem during 'fire fighting'. Despite what people think about the plant 'surviving' the earthquake, quite a bit of the instrumentation was lost in the earthquake. This was a huge part why the operators were/are flying blind and actually made the situation worse in some instances. This is a glaring design deficiency IMO. I do earthquake design all the time and the sensors and electrical systems are the first things protected. No least because of the danger of fire.I'm still scratching my head over these design 'features'.- Radioactive coolant leaves the containment area.   It was the venting of this steam that caused lots of the contamination & explosion. A heat transfer loop would have allowed the operators to vent uncontaminated & hydrogen free fluid. - A simple flameproof flare port/tube would have allowed the hydrogen to be safely burned off. And they knew hydrogen would be produced.- No independent cooling port to pump water into the containment vessel. This left the reactor prone to single point failures in the supply/return piping system.- While it appears to take a 100 hours+ to safely stabilize the reactor, only 8 hours of battery back-up was provided. It would not have been hard to increase this. Cost minimal. This is criminal IMO. Also it appears the wiring for the Generator acted through the battery backup. This was a key problem in trying to hookup generators later as the lines were under water. In such a situation while it might seem that the Battery and Generator are backups to each other the plant has actually doubled its risk as the failure of either one will likely doom the plant.- The lack of adequate emergency fresh water supply and gravity feed tanks above the reactors is another glaring flaw. This would be a code violation in Tokyo which requires gravity water feed for sprinkler systems esp. Yet it was acceptable at a nuclear power plant.- The lack of a 'contamination trench' between the plant and the sea to intercept contaminated flow is shocking. Even chemical plants require this. A fire training simulator I'm working on requires this to prevent stream contamination. Though this may not have helped here where the storage pools are already full.I'm sure an experienced investigator will find many more flaws. Modern accidents are almost always caused by design errors because our experience and engineering is so comprehensive. In terms of liability it is important to remember that the Tsunami was a natural phenomena while the nuclear accident was definitely a man made failure.I have also been pondering Vina's point on the 'insurance risk' and what you design for. In the US many critical newer facilities are designed for a 1 in 500 year flood. Truly important facilities are designed for a 1 in 10,000 year flood event. Yes it is possible to design that way. We know that a thrust fault 9.0+ type event occurs every 200 years to 500 years at every thrust fault on the planet. We also know that a 100m-200m meteorite impact occurs every 2000 years or so. In which case there is a 1/2500 year probability one will hit the ocean somewhere on the planet generating a 20m or so Tsunami. Also every 2000-5000 years a volcanic island landslip occurs generating a Tsunami in the 100m or so height range.So the crude risks for a 100 year lifespan coastal nuclear power plant are...In areas near Thrust faults, All of Asia, Western North America and both West (Yes there is a Thrust fault directly to our West) and East India.- 50% to 20% risk of a thrust fault Earthquake and Tsunami in the life of the plant. This is a risk to all plants from all such quakes.The crude risk that such a thing will happen to a coastal plant somewhere on the planet. A major Thrust fault happens every 10 years or so. Of which 1/2 appear to have nuclear plants nearby. Using 100 year lifetime of plant.- Roughly 500% (Madarassa Math!) chance. In less than 10 years three plants we know of have been clobbered by Tsunami's, Kalpakkam, Daiini and Daichi. Over the next hundred years at least 5 more nuclear coastal plants will face a thrust fault Tsunami.WRT Meteorite Tsunami. Over hundred year lifespan,- 4% chance that some ocean basin somewhere will generate a 20 m Tsunami. Of course when it does happen multiple plants will likely be affected or none at all.WRT Landslip Tsunami. Over Hundred Year life span.- 5%-2% chance of a 100 m Tsunami striking. Of course again either multiple plants will be affected or none at all.What do you think of your insurance risk now, Vina."

1286,chaanakya,06 Apr 2011 21:43 ,"Nuclear crisis man-made, not 'an act of god': expertsIt's not uncommon for nuclear reactors to be located near the sea, where seawater can easily be used to cool the water that then cools the reactors.In all there are 14 reactors at the four facilities along the Pacific coast, where the tsunami triggered by the March 11 quake killed thousands of people. All shut down automatically after the quake and their emergency diesel generators kicked in. But at the Fukushima No. 1 plant the subsequent tsunami knocked out all the power that was supposed to keep critical safety systems running to cool the reactors' fuel rods until external power could be restored.In contrast, two of the three emergency diesel generators at the Tokai nuclear plant in Ibaraki Prefecture withstood the tsunami thanks to 3.3-meter walls put up by operator Japan Atomic Power Co around the two seawater pumps. The pumps are critically important because they send water to cool the emergency generators, which in turn power the cooling systems for the reactors.The walls were built specifically to defend against tsunami, while the one for the third pump had not been completed yet, spokesman Koji Otake said.At the Fukushima No. 1 plant, the seawater pumps were exposed to the environment.The seawater pumps at the Fukushima No. 2 plant are housed in buildings and therefore remained intact. Tepco was able to bring the reactors there under control once external power was restored.Still, Otake of the Japan Atomic Power Co. admitted the three pumps might have been severely damaged if the tsunami had been as high as in Fukushima, where it is believed to have been at least 10 meters.The Tokai plant is located 6.11 meters above sea level, which means the tops of the walls protecting the pumps are 9.41 meters above sea level.The emergency diesel generators at the Onagawa nuclear plant in Miyagi Prefecture were not submerged because the plant is 14.8 meters above sea level, Tohoku Electric Power Co. spokesman Sota Notsu said, adding that the company took tsunami into account when building the plant.The exact heights of the tsunami that hit the four nuclear plants aren't known.While Irikura pointed to Tepco's unpreparedness at the Fukushima No. 1 plant, Takeda of Chubu University said the government, which promotes nuclear power as a clean source of energy to the world, is responsible for checking the safety of nuclear plants.Quake guidelines for nuclear plants, revised by the Nuclear Safety Commission in September 2006, essentially order power companies to design plants without compromising safety in case of earthquakes ""that can be expected no matter how rare.""In the only place in the guidelines where tsunami are mentioned — the last sentence of the 14-page document — it stipulates that plants must be designed ""not to have their safety greatly compromised by tsunami, which can be expected no matter how rare."""

But the situation at the plant remains grim, and could get far worse, according to a new assessment published in the New York Times.First, the good news: For several days, extremely radioactive water has been flowing from the unit 2 reactor into the sea. The levels of activity have been staggering high, and have already begun affecting marine life in the area. Earlier today, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) announced that it had successfully injected some 5,000 litres of ""coagulant"" into the pool. I'm not sure what this coagulant is, but it's been reported as some sort of hardening agent other than concrete.That doesn't mean there aren't other leaks. In a press conference this afternoon, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters that there could be other leaks from unit 2 or the other nearby reactors. TEPCO says it is investigating the possibility further. Meanwhile, the company is dumping tonnes of low-level waste water into the ocean in order to make room in storage vessels for high-level waste that must be cleared from the reactor buildings and the adjacent turbine halls, which have become radioactive cesspits. The decision to dump has angered locals and other nations like South Korea, who feel that they were not adequately consulted. Edano apologized and promised a more open discussion in the future.The bad news is that new evidence suggests the situation inside the reactors themselves could be far more grim than what the Japanese have so far let on. The New York Times article this morning cites a confidential US Nuclear Regulatory Commission assessment that the reactors are really in terrible shape. It suggests that the fuel inside the cores is so melted down that cooling water has not been able to adequately circulate. The continued leaking of highly-radioactive water is also complicating the situation and raises questions about how long the current emergency cooling can continue. Adding to the problems is the revelation that old fuel from the spent fuel pools in units 1-3 may have spread as far as a mile after hydrogen explosions rocked the reactors. Buldozers were apparently used to at least temporarily cover hot fuel between two of the reactor buildings, but the discharge will make cleanup much more difficult.The NRC remains extremely concerned about events that could further destabilize the reactors. For one thing, the extra mass of the water flooding the containment vessels could make them more vulnerable to an aftershock. Hydrogen build-up, caused by steam reacting with fuel rods, could also cause another catastrophic explosion. And apparently the threat of the reactors accidentally restarting remains real, as we discussed in our piece from yesterday.To mitigate these dangers the NRC has made some recommendations, such as purging the containment vessels using unreactive nitrogen gas, and pouring more boric acid onto the reactor cores to stop a further meltdown. TEPCO's latest statement on the reactors suggests that it is considering nitrogen injection. US radiation study sparks debatehttp://www.nature.com/news/2011/110406/full/472015a.htmlJapan's ongoing nuclear emergency has intensified discussion on a simmering issue: the potential cancer risk from living near a reactor that is operating normally.Last year, long before the crisis in Japan, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) asked the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to examine this cancer question, prompted in part by long-standing public unease. The NAS is now consulting with experts about how to design a study, with the next public meetings on the effort scheduled for 18–19 April in Chicago, Illinois. Already, however, some researchers have questioned the study's feasibility and expressed doubt over whether it will produce meaningful results.According to the NRC, less than 1% of a person's total annual background-radiation exposure comes from living near nuclear power plants. Much more comes from natural sources in the earth and air, and from some medical exams. Even so, ""there are recurrent concerns among the public about increased cancer risks"", says Terry Brock, the NRC's project manager for the Analysis of Cancer Risk in Populations Near Nuclear Facilities study. ""We want the most current and most scientifically valid information to respond.""The last US-wide study, which found no evidence of a problem, was published by the National Cancer Institute in 1990. Now the NRC aims to update this effort by taking advantage of two decades of improvements in data and technology. For example, whereas the 1990 study considered only cancer deaths, better record-keeping means that researchers can now look for suspect patterns in cancer diagnoses. The previous study also lumped people by county, regardless of their actual distance from a nuclear plant. Global positioning systems, which can pinpoint where people live in relation to a reactor, should now help provide more meaningful results. A further step would be including estimates of radiation doses and looking for correlations with cancer incidence.But Edward Maher, president of the US-based Health Physics Society, says that even if the study takes all of those factors into account, its statistical power will be too low.“They may make the public feel better, but they're not going to see very low-dose effects.”""We feel that those studies don't have a lot of value,"" says Maher. ""They may make the public feel better, but they're not going to see very low-dose effects."" The money would be better spent on more laboratory research, he adds, where confounding factors such as the presence of other carcinogens can be effectively controlled.Other experts say that the NAS should build on and improve a 2008 German study (C. Spix et al. Eur. J. Cancer 44, 275–284; 2008), which found a roughly 1.5-fold increase in cancers in children younger than 5 living within 5 kilometres of nuclear power plants. The authors concluded that plant emissions were too low to explain the effect, and similar studies done later in France and Britain failed to show any cancer increase, but some researchers have challenged their interpretation of the data.Nevertheless, Steve Wing, an epidemiologist from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says that if there is an effect, it will be easiest to see in children and fetuses. Their rapidly dividing cells make them more sensitive to radiation than adults, and they haven't been exposed to as many possible carcinogens. Wing and his colleagues wrote an article on how best to design the NAS study in the 1 April issue of Environmental Health Perspectives (S. Wing et al. Environ. Health Perspect. doi:10.1289/ehp.1002853; 2011). Among other things, they emphasize the need to obtain radiation-dose estimates for the populations under study.In the upcoming April meetings, the NAS committee will discuss nuclear power plant emission monitoring and hear study design suggestions. After a series of additional meetings, the committee aims to complete recommendations by the end of 2011, after which they will be posted online for public comment. If the committee decides to move forward with the study, another committee will be appointed next year to carry it out.Some experts think that there is no effect for the study to find. Antone Brooks, a radiation toxicologist at Washington State University Tri-cities in Richland, says that DNA repair mechanisms and selective suicide of damaged cells are adequate to handle DNA damage below a certain dose threshold.""We've lived in a sea of radiation throughout evolution,"" says Brooks. ""The body knows how to handle low doses.""Others believe that the risk never vanishes. DNA repair mechanisms don't work perfectly 100% of the time, and even small amounts of radiation confer some risk, says Bill Morgan, the director of radiation biology and biophysics at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland.

1304,abhishek_sharma,07 Apr 2011 05:53 ,"Fukushima update: Hiroshima and Nagasaki bomb experts outline health research needs after Fukushima - April 05, 2011http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2011/04/fukushima_update_hiroshima_and.htmlThe Radiation Effects Research Foundation was created as a joint US-Japan research centre in 1975 with campuses in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to study the effects of radiation among the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bomb blasts. Roy Shore, its chief of research, and Kotaro Ozasa, chief of its epidemiology department, replied by email to my questions about the potential health effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and what research might be needed to monitor these effects.What sort of health studies could or should be done in Japan to follow any health effects of the radiation release from Fukushima, and to obtain information both of scientific value, and of importance to radiation protection? I'm thinking in terms of such studies as those laid out in the EU Agenda for Research on Chernobyl Health (ARCH) project, although the levels of radiation, and the size of the affected areas following the Fukushima accident, are of course very different.A follow-up of the workers at the Fukushima plant is the most important in terms of its scientific and radiation-protection value, since they sustained exposure levels far greater than the general population. A second important thing is to assemble a database of harmonized information on exposure levels in different areas within the fallout area. Based on that, one can rationalize which areas may merit population studies with follow-up of individuals or other study designs. Although one cannot prejudge, it is possible that a follow up of the general population in those areas may yield limited information of scientific value owing to the generally low exposure levels, but may nevertheless be very important to provide assurance of safety and to ameliorate public health concerns. With regard to the ARCH plans, parallels to those studies might be considered several years from now, but it is too early for specific planning about most such studies (e.g., most cancers resulting from radiation arise 10 or more years after exposure).Are studies already been planned/done?A study of nuclear power workers has been ongoing for some years, conducted by the REA [Radiation Effects Association], including the workers at Fukushima, so their current work experience & doses will be added to that continuing study. A consortium of radiation research organizations/groups is in the initial stages of planning potential studies of the population. It is too early in the planning stage to identify what direct international scientific involvement may be needed, but it is expected that international agencies such as the IAEA, UNSCEAR and WHO will be kept fully informed and play important roles.Which data and samples need to be taken immediately to support such studies? How important is it to collect data quickly? Is this happening?The pollution of air, water, etc by radioactive substances in relevant sites is being recorded and would be utilized for the studies. The challenge will be to compile and evaluate the data on levels of radioactivity that are being gathered by various agencies over the range of areas involved. A high degree of cooperation among agencies and organizations will be required for this, as to our knowledge the data are scattered and uncoordinated. Behaviors of the people who were exposed to the pollution may need to be recorded to evaluate how much they were exposed to the radiation externally and internally. That would entail a widely administered questionnaire to persons in the regions to identify their whereabouts, time spent outdoors, food and water sources, etc. Obviously, it is important to obtain those data sooner rather than later, but at this point, coping with the huge effects of the earthquake and tsunami has to take precedence.What are the radiation monitoring data needs for both radiation protection in the current situation, and for longer-term research. What aspects of current radiation monitoring need to be improved?Since it is impossible to have measurements of external doses (i.e., vs. internally deposited radionuclides) for all individuals in a general population, it is valuable to have in place a dense set of radiation monitoring sites so as to be able to estimate exposure levels to a reasonable approximation and perhaps to have follow-up measurements of levels of cesium-137 or other radionuclides in soil samples from a systematic set of locations. Variations in exposure levels in areas between monitoring sites, variation in individual behaviors that may alter exposure levels, and inaccuracies in recall of those behaviors will all be limiting factors in the precision of individual exposure estimates.How can such research, and research needs, be informed by experiences gained from research in both the Chernobyl accident, and other studies on the effects of low-level radiation.The experiences of Chernobyl and others have been useful for considering countermeasures to this accident and anticipated studies. All the nuclear accidents have highlighted how important it is to develop exposure information as quickly and thoroughly (e.g., individualized) as possible, or else crude or absent exposure information may be the ""Achilles heel"" of the epidemiologic research activities. It is also highly desirable to have individual information on lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking), since those factors may alter health risks as much or more than the relatively low levels of radiation exposure, and such variations might create biases in the radiation risk estimates.For full coverage of the Fukushima disaster, go to Nature's news special. Fukushima update: Data, data, everywhere ... - April 05, 2011http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2011/04/fukushima_update_data_data_eve.htmlAcademic researchers worldwide, including veterans of research on the Chernobyl accident, are poring over releases of data on population exposure rates to radioactive fallout from the Fukushima nuclear disaster. But they are finding that making any sense of the data is proving very difficult.One problem is that data are strewn across many individual web pages on several websites, for example, those of Japan's science ministry, here and here, the health ministry, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency,and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Moreover, the data are often in different units, with few descriptive details of, for example, sampling techniques used.The Japanese government does appear to be making efforts to be open about data, though. Summary maps (provided by the US Department of Energy) of aerial radiation monitoring have also been extremely useful, researchers say, though no geographical information system data of the maps is available from the website.""The problem is that it is very difficult to get a real picture of the exposure of the population,"" says Elisabeth Cardis, a radiation epidemiologist at the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, ""I've been poring through many reports from many different bodies, and the information is very confusing."" Measures for the same zone sometimes differ greatly between reports, and it's not made clear how measurements were made, she says. There's a need for a critical review of all the available data, she says.With Japan preoccupied with efforts to deal with the huge aftermaths of the 11 March earthquake and tsunami, and now having a nuclear disaster on its hands, researchers are loathe to criticize the accessibility of the data to outside academic researchers. ""I don't think we can be too critical about demanding data"" under the circumstances, says Richard Wakeford, an epidemiologist at the Dalton Nuclear Institute at the University of Manchester, UK. Far more data are available to academics outside the country than in the days immediately following the earthquake on 11 March, he adds. Most importantly, the people who need it most -- the Japanese and other radiation protection officials on the front line -- will likely be getting much fuller data (much in Japanese) than is contained in the English summaries being posted on websites, he says. But he agrees that ""it's not easy to find your way around the data"".Scientists say that what is also frustrating is that much of the data are being published in 1990's-style static pdfs -- whereas we are now in an Internet-era of web services and machine-readable data -- making the computation of data from the hundreds of pdf files -- next to impossible without huge manual efforts to extract the numbers. Providing even simple spreadsheets, or csv files, would make analysis of the multiple releases of data much easier to compute and provide a fuller picture of all the data, they say. Metadata, such as the latitude and longitude of the sites sampled, is also lacking or absent. """"There is all this data being produced, but you can do nothing with it, you can't get any meaning out of it,"" says Keith Baverstock, a radiobiologist at the University of Eastern Finland's Kuopio Campus. What's needed, he says, is for an independent group to ""harmonize and process the data, and put out as quickly as possible an evidence-based risk assessment to the public and government.""Researchers say that they largely trust the Japanese government data, but are more sceptical of that produced by TEPCO, the operator of the Fukushima plant. TEPCO has also been criticized for reporting erroneous data during the current crisis - see here. TEPCO should do more to provide accurate data more openly and in a more timely fashion, says Shunichi Yamashita, head of the Atomic Bomb Disease Institute at the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University. He adds that he would like to see the government send its own teams to the Fukushima plant to get independent data on the reactor status, and environmental and health impacts at the site.For full coverage of the Fukushima disaster, go to Nature's news special. Primer: Will Radiation Lay Waste to Japan's Fish?http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/primer-will-radiation-lay-waste.htmlAlthough radioactive leaks in the Fukushima plant are now plugged, Japan's coastal waters have taken a beating. Authorities dumped some of the waste seawater used to cool the reactors back into the sea, where it joined contaminated water leaking from cracks in the plant and nuclear fallout from the air. Almost as soon as the reactor broke, contamination of Japanese food exports became a concern. Now the Japanese are screening all fish products, some of which do indeed have high levels of radioactivity, and health officials there have set a radiation safety limit on seafood consumption. It's unclear whether the contaminated fish were caught in or out of the 20-kilometer no-go zone around Fukushima, where radiation in the water is 3555 times the legal limit.Still, analysts don't believe that any of the fish have high enough levels of radioactivity to harm human health. For instance, because it takes only 8 days for the radioactive isotope iodine-131 to decay away to half its original level of radioactivity, simply waiting should be a fix. Cesium-137, however, can accumulate in muscles and is a bigger concern with a half-life of 30 years; scientists plan to track it more carefully.In the meantime, some marine ecologists are curious about how these levels of radiation could be harming marine life itself, but most aren't terribly worried; the vastness of the ocean dilutes radiation quickly.Additionally, crustaceans and insects that live in the ocean are extremely hardy and resistant to radiation, according to marine radioecologist Bruno Fievet of IRSN, the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety. The level of radiation necessary to kill marine species—or even damage them—is orders of magnitude higher than the level that would harm a human, says Fievet, who studies the effects of nuclear plants on developing shellfish larvae. When researchers bring samples of marine species into the lab to study whether radiation can cause mutations, they expose them to gamma rays, the same kind of radiation used to sterilize equipment and food. The level of radiation Fievet uses in his lab is many times higher than the radiation in the water around Fukushima.But marine life in the coastal area, however, is being exposed to radiation through a more direct route. Rather than just external gamma rays, plants and animals are absorbing and ingesting particles of radioactive cesium and iodine, putting these isotopes directly into their tissues. With irradiation from the inside as well as out, it may take much less to cause genetic changes and impair growth and reproduction, even if it's still not enough to kill the species. But scientists just don't know what the effects will be, Fievet says, because handling these radionuclides is just too hard to do safely and efficiently in the lab.Radioecologists at IRSN, in U.S. national labs, at the International Atomic Energy Agency, and at universities around the world are beginning to plan long-term studies-once the situation stabilizes-on how radiation moves through food chains and builds up in organisms: a process called bioaccumulation. If marine species take up these radioactive particles faster than they break them down, the radiation can concentrate and affect larger animals that eat them. Some species, such as brown seaweed are extremely efficient at bioaccumulation. Dominique Boust, another marine radioecologist at IRSN, says that the seaweed can store iodine-137 in its tissues at 100,000 times the concentration that it exists in the water. (In fact, planting brown seaweed off the coast of Fukushima has even been proposed as a way to clean up the water, although most scientists don't believe this is a good fix.) The best cleaner, Fievet says, is dilution in the massive Pacific Ocean. "

In fact, there are containment design requirement differences. A PWR operates at over 2,000 pounds per square inch (psi). Conversely, a BWR operates at about half that – around 1,000 psi The Times also compares Three Mile Island and Fukushima, saying that the PWR reactor at Three Mile Island withstood a hydrogen blast. In fact, the hydrogen blast at Three Mile Island occurred within the primary containment. The hydrogen blast at Fukushima occurred in the reactor building – which is the secondary and not the primary containment. The indirect comparison between the blast at Three Mile Island and the blast at Fukushima is misleading. Also:http://www.gereports.com/the-mark-i-con ... -reactors/The modifications made to Mark I containments include:•“Quenchers” were installed to distribute the steam bubbles in order to produce rapid condensation and to reduce loads on the unit. In a reactor, exhaust steam is piped into a suppression chamber, which is known as the torus and is a large, rounded suppression pool that sits next to the reactor core. It is used to remove heat when large quantities of steam are released from the reactor. In the torus, the steam bubbles go under water. With the modification to the Mark I, the quenchers, which are also underwater, make steam bubbles smaller by breaking up the larger bubbles. This in turn reduces pressure.•Another modification is the installation of deflectors inside the torus. When that steam goes in, the water level rises. The deflectors that were added break up the pressure wave that is produced and help relieve pressure on the torus.•A further modification was made to the “saddles” on which the torus sits — basically the series of leg-like structures that support it. The construction was fortified, as was the steel, to accommodate the loads that are generated."

Though there are 'features' that could have been added or better thought through. As far the loss of power, they did not technically lose on-site power. The batteries worked. But when the generator failed there wasn't enough charge  to safely stabilize the system down. This smells of 'value engineering' to me. Battery technology has advanced enough that even a 100 hour+ output should be relatively inexpensive.

And attention has now moved south to a region off Tokyo as possibly under strain.http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/201 ... 0000c.htmlAnalysis by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) suggests the focus of the Jogan quake that struck in 869 is situated in a 200-kilometer-long, 100-kilometer-wide area off the coast of a line between Miyagi Prefecture and Fukushima Prefecture, and that the temblor registered magnitude 8.4.Furumura pointed to the possibility that the March 11 quake could trigger a major inland earthquake. An inland earthquake struck in Aichi Prefecture in 1945 -- between the previous Tonankai earthquake in 1944 and Nankai quake in 1946.Back at Fukushima, the costs continue to mount... ..Why are we building Nuclear again, because its cheap?http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld ... 1011.storyNow, that improvised solution to one nuclear nightmare is spawning another: what to do with the millions of gallons of water that has become highly radioactive as it washes through the plant.The water being used to try to cool the reactors and the dangerous spent fuel rods is leaking through fissures inside the plant, seeping down through tunnels and passageways to the lowest levels, where it is accumulating into a sea of lethal waste.The Department of Energy is decommissioning eight reactors at Hanford and plans to process about 58 million gallons of radioactive sludge now in leaky underground tanks, all at an estimated cost of $100 billion to $130 billion, according to outside estimates. But unlike Fukushima Daiichi, none of the Hanford reactors melted down and virtually all of the site is accessible to workers without risking exposure to dangerous levels of radioactivity.Even with a pond, it could take up to 10 years before the radioactivity would decay enough for the material to be handled, Morse said. Building a storage pond ""buys you time,"" he said.But other experts sharply disagree, saying exposing the material to open air could allow radioactive iodine and other volatile substances to blow off the site, adding to the remote contamination that is already spreading dozens of miles from the plant.At some point, however, Japan will have to add facilities to existing treatment plants in order to vitrify the radioactive material into glass logs or other dry forms that could be stored in alloy canisters. Those logs or canisters would have to be buried somewhere.Where that burial ground is built is a question that the Japanese are only beginning to consider.We still have a chance to turn away from this Raksha, (no offence to raksha's everywhere) if we proceed we should charge and set aside these sorts of sums for the decommission and potential accident scenario's.

1307,abhishek_sharma,07 Apr 2011 07:36 ,"A long shadow over Fukushima: One impact of Japan's nuclear crisis is a dim but definite echo of Chernobyl, says Jim Smith — decades of caesium-137http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110405/full/472007a.htmlThree weeks after the Fukushima accident, a clearer picture is beginning to emerge of possible long-term environmental consequences. The US Department of Energy (DOE) aerial survey of radiation doses was a crucial development. A clear trace reaching out 30–40 kilometres northwest of the plant marked a zone of dose rate above 125 microsieverts per hour, a level at which immediate evacuation is often advised. Already, external doses are rapidly declining as a result of the decay of short-lived isotopes. But, as with the 1986 Chernobyl accident, it is caesium-137, with a half-life of 30.2 years, that will determine the long-term impact on the contaminated region and its residents.The extent of caesium-137 contamination at Fukushima is not yet clear, but available data indicate very high levels in some areas. The 30 March press release from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports caesium-137 deposition ranging from 0.02 to 3.7 megabecquerels per square metre (MBq m–2) at sites 25–58 kilometres from the Fukushima plant. The higher values are consistent with Japanese soil data from Iitate village, 40 kilometres northwest of the plant. Perhaps surprisingly, there is still no clear information on caesium-137 contamination within 20 kilometres of the plant (the distance of the evacuation zone), although the DOE map implies that this could be of the order of megabecquerels per square metre if the isotopic composition of deposits near the plant is similar to that in the area farther to the northwest.The implications of these data are far-reaching. If large areas are contaminated with 0.5 MBq m–2 or more, evacuation could be for the long term. After Chernobyl, long-term evacuation usually occurred in areas with radioactivity above 0.55 MBq m–2, although some believe that this limit could have been safely set much higher. Contamination of the food chain will depend on soil type: soils rich in clay bind radiocaesium strongly: bioavailability in organic upland and forest soils is generally significantly higher than in mineral soils. On the basis of the Fukushima data seen so far, it seems likely that in some areas, food restrictions could hold for decades (J. T. Smith et al. Nature 405, 141; 2000), particularly for wild foodstuffs such as mushrooms, berries and freshwater fish.'Liquidators' could be brought in to decontaminate towns and villages in evacuated zones and reclaim farmland, although this approach met with varying success at Chernobyl. The UK Health Protection Agency's Recovery Handbook for Radiation Incidents details a range of measures for residential areas, including removal of top soil and resurfacing of roads. On farms, approaches to remediation include applying potassium fertilizers to crops to compete with radiocaesium uptake, and giving 'Prussian blue' boluses to grazing animals to reduce radio­caesium absorption.Remediation has some drawbacks: huge economic cost, for example, and potentially massive quantities of contaminated waste. Consumers may refuse products grown in contaminated areas even when they meet regulations. Chernobyl has taught us that the social and psychological responses to radiation are of great, perhaps paramount, importance.'Headline' estimates of Chernobyl's public-health impact are dramatic: one 2006 estimate led by the International Agency for Research on Cancer foresaw 16,000 cases of thyroid cancer and 25,000 other cancers resulting from the radiation, among ""several hundred million cancer cases from other causes"". But risks to the individual are low. As early as 1991, an IAEA study found psychological effects to be ""wholly disproportionate to the biological significance of the radiation"". This study placed a high priority on providing accurate information about radiation health risks to affected populations. But 15 years later, the UN Chernobyl Forum Report still concluded that Chernobyl's impact on mental health is ""the largest public-health problem caused by the accident to date"". Misperceptions, and inefficient compensation, have led to widespread fatalism and feelings of victimization among locals. Resulting rises in alcohol consumption and smoking may well have done more damage than radiation exposure (see Nature 471, 562–565; 2011). The failure to solve social and psychological problems relates not only to a lack of effort (at Chernobyl, vastly more has been spent on physical remediation than on public engagement), but also to the intractability of the problem.The long-term response to Fukushima will have to be pragmatic. The Japanese authorities may have to rewrite the rule-book, as they have begun to do in allowing doses of 250 mSv for radiation workers. After an accident, it may be appropriate to set exposure limits for members of the public higher than the typical 1 mSv per year maximum. A limit of 5–10 mSv per year (perhaps with voluntary resettlement at doses above 1 mSv per year) may be appropriate, bearing in mind that millions of people in areas of high natural radioactivity worldwide are exposed to more than 10 mSv per year, and that occupational exposures (for example, to long-haul air crews) can be around 5 mSv per year.A turning point in my understanding of Chernobyl's impacts came while studying lakes in Belarus during the mid-1990s. In an evacuated area, lake fish contained tens of thousands of becquerels per kilogram. A couple in their early seventies lived near the lake, eating the fish and growing vegetables. They were living off contaminated land, but leading the life they had chosen to lead. This wouldn't by any means be the right choice for everybody, but I am convinced they had made the right decision for them: they were Chernobyl survivors, not victims.

That 30 Km plus is already over 20mSv a year, and the regions further are probably only a little less than 20mSv a year.So despite changing the rules because a large evacuation is not practical, people in so-called ""safe areas"" are already being exposed to radiation considered unsafe till Fukushima happened."

In spite of the brilliant climate models, practical weather forecasts still depend on some semi-empirical models that do not try to predict more than 3-6 days at most.

So excess ""carbon footprint"" is not that risky then? [there is trade in carbon units but not direct trade in long terms climate risks of carbon consumption].Even if the consequence of ""excess carbon"" use is ""bad"", why cannot we also consider it as a risk and price it in some financial market into which people can invest? After all nuclear risks seem to be trivially compensated for by such financial arguments? Everything is price-able isnt it? If then such a market shows that prices for carbon risk become much higher on that market compared to nuclear risk - all the more lead in the pencil of nukonergy!

The Nuclear Safety Commission is suggesting revising the evacuation standard only for the current emergencyThere are two main takeaways from this -- for evacuation.1) The limit for individuals is being raised from 1mSv to 20mSv per year for the purposes of this incident2) The zone is still being asked to be expanded to 30 KmsMeaning? That 30 Km plus is already over 20mSv a year, and the regions further are probably only a little less than 20mSv a year.So despite changing the rules because a large evacuation is not practical, people in so-called ""safe areas"" are already being exposed to radiation considered unsafe till Fukushima happened.As you said, the link clearly stated that the raise in exposure to 20 mSv/year was done for this accident, and it was done for good reason.  By moving people out, when other parts of the country are also devastated, you expose them to other nasty things like water borne diseases and infections from poor hygiene.  It would be better to keep them in their homes and monitor the exposure levels.  To put it in context, most of us are already exposed to >5 mSv/year from normal living activities (more so if you eat potassium rich foods), and the threshold of 1 mSv/year isn't very practical.  But who am I to say?  I'm not a scientist or academic, just a person who eats bananas, potatoes, goes up to high elevations and takes international flights.  Ok, lets take a step back and understand what radiation is.  There is non-ionizong radiation and ionizing radiation.

1320,chaanakya,07 Apr 2011 20:10 ,"http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/201 ... 5000c.htmlNishiyama told a press conference in the afternoon that so far no further leakage has been detected from the pit. But there is a possibility that the water, which has lost an outlet, could show up from other areas of the plant.The highly radioactive water is believed to have come from the No. 2 reactor core, where fuel rods have partially melted, and ended up in the pit. The pit is connected to the No. 2 reactor turbine building and an underground trench connected to the building, both of which were found to be filled with highly contaminated water.To make room to store the highly radioactive water that is hampering the plant's restoration work, TEPCO continued to dump into the sea massive amounts of low-level contaminated water from inside a nuclear waste disposal facility at the site as well as contaminated groundwater found from around the Nos. 5 and 6 unit buildings.TEPCO is aiming to dispose of a total of about 10,000 tons of low-level contaminated water into the sea by this weekend, a move which has sparked concern among neighboring countries and strong protests from the domestic fishing industry.After opening up the disposal facility, which can accommodate 30,000 tons of liquid, some repair work is expected to take place for about a week to ensure that the facility can retain highly radioactive water safely without fear of the stored liquid leaking outside.The plant's power grid and most of the emergency diesel generators were knocked out by the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and ensuing tsunami on March 11, resulting in the loss of many of the reactors' key cooling functions, partial melting of reactor cores and hydrogen explosions.According to estimates by TEPCO announced Wednesday, 25 percent of the nuclear fuel rods have been damaged at the No. 3 reactor. The company earlier said that 70 percent of the No. 1 reactor's fuel rods and 30 percent of the No. 2 reactor's fuel rods have been damaged.Nishiyama said past hydrogen explosions have likely occurred due to hydrogen accumulation caused by the reaction of melted fuel rods' zirconium with steam from the coolant water. But now there is concern that hydrogen could accumulate in the No. 1 reactor under a different process involving radiation-induced decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen.In announcing TEPCO's decision to inject nitrogen into the reactor's containment vessel, an operation approved by the government, the nuclear agency said that radioactive leaks are ""unlikely to significantly rise"" even if the pressure inside the vessel increases as a result of the injection.Nishiyama said that he also expects nitrogen to be injected into the Nos. 2 and 3 reactors in the future.The utility has been pouring massive amounts of water into the reactors and their spent nuclear fuel pools as a stopgap measure to cool them down. But the measure is causing ""side effects,"" such as the detection of contaminated water in various parts of the nuclear complex and some leakage into the sea.A seawater sample taken near the No. 2 reactor water intake on Saturday showed a radioactive iodine-131 concentration of 7.5 million times the maximum level permitted under law, or about 300,000 becquerels per cubic centimeter.In the first case of contamination levels in seafood exceeding the maximum legal limit, radioactive cesium in excess of the set limit was detected in young sand lance caught Monday in the sea off the northern part of Ibaraki Prefecture."
1321,chaanakya,07 Apr 2011 20:13 ,"http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/201 ... 9000c.htmlCurrently, power from outside the complex has been restored. Electric pumps have been temporarily set up by reactor units No. 1 through 3, and they are pumping fresh water from outside through pipes into the reactors' pressure vessels, where the water is cooling the fuel rods.Cooling is also necessary for the spent fuel rods in the pools at the top of the reactor buildings. For reactor buildings No. 1, 3, and 4, which have lost large parts of their walls and ceilings, water is being applied to the pools from a hose held by the massive crane of a concrete pump truck. The No. 2 reactor building's pool is being cooled by sending water through pipes.According to TEPCO, although the temperatures and pressures inside the reactors are high, they are stable, and the spent fuel pools are also under control thanks to the application of water.However, the situation continues to be dangerous. While the 4-meter long fuel rods in the pressure vessels should all normally be completely submerged in water, they are all still partially exposed: the No. 1 reactor's rods have 1.65 meters exposed, the No. 2 reactor rods 1.5 meters, and the No. 3 reactor rods 2.2 meters.Meanwhile, the No. 5 and 6 reactors, which along with the No. 4 reactor were shut down for inspection at the time of the earthquake and tsunami, have had their cooling systems restored and pressure vessels and spent fuel pools cooled and stabilized, thanks partly to the relatively early timing of their connection to outside power.Although the crisis may have lulled, radioactive water is currently a big problem. As long as water continues being applied to the No. 1 through 3 reactor units, water containing radioactive materials will continue to accumulate on plant grounds. Some of this water has leaked from the reactor buildings to adjacent turbine buildings, and at the No. 2 unit, the water further leaked to an underground tunnel called a ""trench."" The radioactive water accumulated across the complex is estimated at around 60,000 metric tons, the disposal of which is one more headache for TEPCO.TEPCO is planning to move two metric tons of particularly radioactive water accumulated near the No. 2 reactor into a container capable of holding around 30,000 metric tons. To make room for this, TEPCO released into the ocean about 6,000 metric tons of the around 8,000 metric tons of low-level radioactive water already in the container."

1324,chaanakya,07 Apr 2011 20:40 ,"http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201104060126.htmlOfficials at another Tokyo Electric Power Co. nuclear plant in Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, Niigata Prefecture, analyzed the differences in safety designs at the two Fukushima plants.According to their analysis and TEPCO sources, there are clear differences in safety levels between the two plants concerning power source equipment, such as emergency diesel generators and transformers at the reactor cores, and pumps used to bring in seawater to remove residual heat from the cores.TEPCO documents show that the emergency diesel generators located in the turbine buildings at the Fukushima No. 1 plant were flooded by the tsunami and rendered inoperable, except for the one at the No. 6 reactor. This effectively disabled the cooling mechanisms.After the No. 1 plant lost its power sources, the reactor cores became much more difficult to control, leading to serious problems, including hydrogen explosions that damaged the housing of the reactors.Radioactive materials have also been emitted from the damaged reactors.No such problems have been encountered at the No. 2 plant.The emergency generators at the No. 2 plant were in buildings housing the reactor cores. Because the reactor buildings are much more airtight, the generators at the No. 2 plant continued to function after the tsunami struck.Emergency generators are also located within the airtight reactor core buildings at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, which has similar design features to the Fukushima No. 2 plant.When asked about the differences in the safety designs between the No. 1 and No. 2 plants, an official at TEPCO headquarters said: ""This does not mean we have admitted that a problem exists. We will conduct further detailed studies to identify the problems.""The No. 1 plant was built in the 1960s and 1970s. Improvement work was conducted in the 1970s and 1980s to strengthen its resistance to earthquakes.A nuclear engineer who used to work for TEPCO and was involved in those improvements said no consideration was paid to the location of the emergency diesel generators or the seawater pumps.""First of all, there was the judgment that the reactor core buildings were in a safe location in relation to the expected height of any tsunami that might strike the plant,"" the engineer said. ""However, even if they wanted to move the generators, there was no space within the reactor building, so that would have meant a major revision in design.""At the time, no one considered making such changes,"" the engineer said.Both the No. 1 and No. 2 nuclear plants were hit by waves more than 14 meters high, well above the expected limits of 5.7 to 5.2 meters estimated in safety designs.The tsunami rendered inoperable all of the No. 1 plant's pumps, which were also not located within a sealed structure.Although the pumps at the No. 2 plant were inside buildings, the tsunami crippled the ones to the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 4 reactors. But the pump at the No. 3 reactor continued to cool the reactor core.Referring to the possibility of installing the seawater pumps inside buildings, the former TEPCO engineer said, ""It would have been a major project because various pipes are laid out under the pumps, and so all of that would also have had to be moved.""A midlevel TEPCO official also said money was a big reason why repairs and changes to the No. 1 plant were not made.""The blueprints for the reactor cores at the No. 1 plant were bought 'as is' by Toshiba Corp. from General Electric Co., so the priority at that time was on constructing the reactors according to those blueprints,"" the official said.When the Fukushima No. 1 plant was being built, Japan was importing technology from the United States and learning from a more advanced nuclear power nation.The No. 1 plant was considered a ""learning experience.""A former TEPCO executive said, ""The Fukushima No. 1 plant was a practice course for Toshiba and Hitachi Ltd. to learn about GE's design on a trial-and-error basis.""With the exception of the No. 6 reactor, the other five reactors at the Fukushima No. 1 plant are Mark I boiling-water reactors developed by GE.According to sources, the locations of emergency generators and the seawater pump structure were also based on a GE design.In contrast, the No. 6 reactor is a Mark II reactor. Moreover, the Fukushima No. 2 plant and Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, which were constructed from the mid-1970s to the 1990s, used an improved and safer version of the Mark II reactor.After Toshiba and Hitachi gained experience in constructing nuclear plants, they located emergency generators and seawater pumps within buildings.Yet those safety improvements were never reflected in changes at the Fukushima No. 1 plant.Other TEPCO officials said that changing the anti-tsunami design or moving the location of the emergency generators would have been an acknowledgment that previous decisions were insufficient.Kiyoshi Sakurai, a commentator on technology issues, said that relying on a GE design also put the Fukushima No. 1 plant at a disadvantage because U.S. designers were not as cautious about earthquakes and tsunami as those working in Japan."

The assessment implied that the damage at the No. 2 unit was worse than previously believed.   But extremely radioactive material continues to ooze out of the reactor pressure vessel at Reactor 2, and the leak is likely to widen with time, a senior nuclear executive said.  “It’s a little like pulling a thread out of your tie,” he said. “Any breach gets bigger.”   Flashes of extremely intense radioactivity have become a serious problem, he said. Tokyo Electric’s difficulties in providing accurate information on radiation are not a result of software problems, as some Japanese officials have suggested, but stem from radiation damaging measurement instruments because it exceeds the maximum dose that they are designed to measure, he said.   “It’s killing the measuring equipment,” he said. “They’re blaming it on software — it’s their meters getting cooked.”    Broken pieces of fuel rods have been found outside of Reactor 2, and are now being covered with bulldozers, he said. The broken pieces may be from spent fuel rods in the spent-fuel pools, as opposed to the reactors themselves. Hydrogen explosions have flung them out of the reactor building.   “They’re running bulldozers around to bury the stuff so it doesn’t cook people going by,” he said. "

As we discussed yesterday, the purpose of the gas is to reduce the chances of another massive explosion at the reactor. The inert nitrogen will, in theory, keep volatile hydrogen and oxygen from mixing inside the containment vessel and reactor and prevent another explosion.The threat of a hydrogen blast is among the most serious facing the reactors. After a tsunami struck the complex on 11 March, the reactors heated up and their fuel began melting. Zirconium cladding around the fuel reacted with steam inside the reactor, creating hydrogen gas. That gas exploded when it came in contact with oxygen from the atmosphere, blowing apart the buildings around units 1 and 3 and crippling the containment vessel of unit 2.There's good reason to believe that there's still a fair bit of hydrogen inside the reactors, and it could explode again. TEPCO has offered an explanation that isn't entirely clear, but here's my take: Initially the reactor cores were quite hot, but they've gradually been cooling over the past week or so. As they've done so, the steam in the heavy containment vessels surrounding the reactors has condensed, possibly creating a hydrogen-filled area of negative pressure at the top of the containment vessel. Depending on how airtight the reactors are, oxygen could leak in and trigger another explosion. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission was apparently deeply concerned about this threat ten days ago, and recommended injecting nitrogen, to fill the void left by the steam.It's no surprise that the delicate operation is proceeding slowly. According to Kyodo news, TEPCO injected just 200 cubic meters of nitrogen between 1:30 and 9:50 local time. Over the next six days they hope to inject a total of 6,000 cubic meters into the reactor. Depending on how it goes, they may try something similar for reactors 2 and 3.For full coverage of the Fukushima disaster, go to Nature's news special. Japan's Tsunami Topped 37 Metershttp://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/japans-tsunami-topped-37-meters.htmlThe 11 March tsunami that inundated coastal regions of northeast Japan was 37.9 meters high in at least one location. That's tall enough to engulf a 10-story building. But ""we think we will see [evidence of] bigger waves in other areas,"" says Satoko Oki, a seismologist at the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute.A survey team from the institute found high water marks and other evidence for the monster wave in the port of Koborinai in Miyako City, Iwate Prefecture. The results of the area survey were posted yesterday on the institute Web site in Japanese. An English translation is expected in a week to 10 days.Oki says the local topography—the port is on low land sandwiched between two mountains—probably contributed to the size of the wave. Despite its size, the wave isn't a record for Japan: A 38.2-meter tsunami struck farther south along the northeast coast in 1896. Oki says the team might find telltale signs of higher waves as it extends its survey southward into more hard-hit areas closer to the epicenter of the quake. She expects the team will post its next update in about a week. "

1354,chaanakya,08 Apr 2011 19:07 ,"TEPCO sees more power / Utility expects to secure nearly 50 mil. kilowatts in summerQuake ans Tsunami also knocked out Thermal Power Plants at  Kashima, Ibaraki Prefecture. ( no evacuation zone there) They are now hoping to start it. They are also trying to get Gas turbine generators  to tide over the summer peak loads. No such luck with NPPs. Does that tell us something?Tokyo Electric Power Co. is expected to secure a power supply of nearly 50 million kilowatts this summer, up about 3.5 million kilowatts from an earlier projection, it was learned Thursday.The estimated increase will be made possible through various means, including the reactivation of a suspended thermal power station. Through these measures, TEPCO hopes to avert rolling blackouts initially envisaged for this summer.According to a TEPCO estimate, this summer's power consumption likely will peak at 55 million kilowatts.The cataclysmic March 11 earthquake-tsunami disaster has forced the company to suspend operations at several nuclear and other power plants in the northeast of the country, including a thermal power plant in Kashima, Ibaraki Prefecture.TEPCO hopes to link its anticipated supply-capacity increase to a government plan to restrict power use in corporate circles and voluntary power-saving efforts by corporations and ordinary households, thereby avoiding rolling blackouts to the greatest extent possible.The power utility intends to restart four generators, one by one, at its Kashima plant as early as the end of the month. The utility had not originally intended to restart this station, but doing so could generate 1.4 million kilowatts of power.The thermal power complex is operated by Kashima Kyodo Electric Power Co., a body jointly established by TEPCO and Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd.TEPCO also will step up efforts to secure electric generators from domestic and overseas organizations. For instance, it will borrow two gas turbine generators produced by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. from the Thai government.Such generators could add another 1 million kilowatts or more to the power utility's supply capacity over the next few months.Planned measures include the purchase of surplus power from various sources, including manufacturing firms that possess powerful in-house generators, as well as an increase in the capacity utilization rates of TEPCO-operated thermal power stations.The power corporation hopes these different steps will bring its supply capacity to nearly 50 million kilowatts around late July, when power demand is expected to peak.Initially, TEPCO wanted to enhance its supply capacity to 46.5 million kilowatts during that time of the year.Last summer, power consumption rose to a maximum of about 60 million kilowatts due to extremely hot weather. With this in mind, the government hopes to impose power-use restrictions on the corporate sector, particularly large companies. This will require these entities to reduce their power use by about 25 percent from their maximum level a year earlier.The government is also considering setting nonbinding power-saving for small and middle-sized corporations and ordinary households.To complement this, TEPCO is hurrying to increase its supply capacity, in hopes of reducing the gap between power supply and demand.(Apr. 8, 2011)"

Measurements at the same spot were 600 times the standard on Tuesday and 1,000 times on Wedneday.In a series of surveys 15 kilometers from the coastline, a reading 9.3 times the national limit was detected north of the plant, off the coast of Minami-soma City.The government's nuclear safety agency has instructed the Fukushima plant operator to review its monitoring activities, as the radioactive material is likely to be carried northward by ocean currents.The agency stressed the need to monitor areas of high radiation concentration more closely to clarify possible contamination of the ocean.Friday, April 08, 2011 21:57 +0900 (JST)Nations fret over plant's water dump / Dissatisfaction aired at confab on N-safetyVIENNA--Nations participating in a conference sponsored by the International Atomic Energy Agency expressed concern Wednesday over the discharge of water containing a relatively low level of radioactive substances into the sea near the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.Koichiro Nakamura, deputy director general for nuclear safety at the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, explained Japan's nuclear safety regulations and efforts to enhance emergency countermeasures at other nuclear power plants in the wake of the Fukushima crisis.Nakamura told a press conference held for the Japanese media that the Japanese side did not bring up the issue of discharging contaminated water, but other participants expressed concerns.Wednesday's meeting of 12 countries, including Japan, Portugal and Vietnam, was originally held to confirm Japan's compliance with the treaty. The Fukushima No. 1 plant was not on the official agenda.However, questions related to the Fukushima No. 1 plant crisis were raised one after another, on such topics as the basic thinking behind Japan's tsunami countermeasures; what Japan's tsunami countermeasures will be in the future; and differences between Japan's quake resistance guidelines and the IAEA's safety standards, Nakamura said."
1356,chaanakya,08 Apr 2011 19:29 ,"New cooling options being exploredThe Yomiuri ShimbunTokyo Electric Power Co. is considering alternative methods, including the construction of improvised systems, to cool reactors at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.Ongoing operations--which involve pouring water directly into the reactor cores to lower temperatures inside the pressure vessels of the Nos. 1 to 3 reactors to below 100 C--have not worked as expected, and restoration of the reactors' existing cooling systems is not likely to happen soon.The discouraging outlook has prompted TEPCO to begin exploring new options.The original cooling systems worked by circulating water inside the pressure vessels. After absorbing heat in the pressure vessels, water was extracted and cooled by heat exchangers before being returned to the pressure vessels.The damaged systems are now unable to circulate water, so new water must be continually added to the pressure vessels to control temperatures.However, because the water sources used in the continual injections are positioned lower than those incorporated in the original systems, it is unclear whether fuel rods in the reactors are being entirely covered with water.In addition, water contaminated with radioactive substances has apparently leaked from the pressure vessels, which means TEPCO cannot increase the amount of water being injected.On March 23, new water was being channeled into the No. 1 reactor at a rate of 300 liters per minute. The current rate is about one-third this amount.The surface temperature of the No. 1 reactor pressure vessel is still above 200 C. The temperature of nuclear fuel inside the vessel is much higher.A TEPCO official said: ""We're currently removing heat that's being generated by the fuel. We haven't been able to remove the huge amount of heat that accumulated while the reactors were in operation.""TEPCO's immediate goal is to restore the power supply to the reactors and the existing cooling systems.But key elements of those systems are located in the basement floors of the reactor buildings, areas that are contaminated with radioactive materials, and this is forcing TEPCO to consider other options.One proposal is to build makeshift cooling systems. TEPCO would have to access pipes connected to the pressure vessels at some point outside the reactor buildings where radiation levels are low. From there, the company could connect the pipes to new heat exchangers and pumps.Another option under consideration is trying to lower the temperatures of the pressure vessels from the outside, by filling the containment vessels that surround them with water or some other coolant. The success of this plan would depend on whether the containment vessels have been damaged.""It might be wise to set up new cooling systems,"" said Michio Ishikawa, the top adviser of the Japan Nuclear Technology Institute. ""If the current conditions continue, the amount of radioactive substances being discharged from the reactors might increase. Therefore, all possible options need to be considered.""(Apr. 8, 2011)"

But that is OT here. Not that I am pro coal yada yada. Just pointing out.  Toshiba Corp. has proposed decommissioning four troubled nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi power station in about 10 years, a much shorter time frame than the 14 years needed to dismantle the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in the United States, industry sources said Friday.Toshiba, one of the two Japanese reactor makers, filed the proposal with Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of the Fukushima plant, and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, after compiling it with U.S. nuclear energy firms including its subsidiary Westinghouse Electric Co., according to the sources.Toshiba believes it can rely on the U.S. firms' expertise from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident to decommission the Fukushima reactors.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano indicated that it was difficult for the government to map out a time schedule for decommissioning, saying it is seeking help from experts, scholars and companies that specialize in such work.''The government wants to show a specific road map (on how to go about the decommissioning), but the reactors now are not fully stable,'' Edano, the top government spokesman, told a news conference.According to the proposal, it will take about 10 years to remove the fuel rods in the containers and the spent nuclear fuel rods in the storage pools from the four reactors, to demolish various facilities there and to improve soil conditions.Another Japanese reactor maker, Hitachi Ltd., in a tie-up with General Electric Co. of the United States, is expected to file its own proposal, the sources said.Tokyo Electric and METI are expected to look into the proposals from Toshiba and Hitachi before moving to dismantle the reactors.The four reactors were crippled by the March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami.In Japan, Chubu Electric Power Co. is currently working on decommissioning two reactors at the Hamaoka nuclear power plant in Omaezaki, Shizuoka Prefecture, and plans to have the work completed by March 2037."

1368,Amber G.,09 Apr 2011 03:51 ,"More   bannana equivalent dose, fourth root of time etc type article from MITNSE..(Some of this has been in brf before, but this is a nice writeup, so posting in full)  ({..} comments are by me) Regulatory Limits on Radiation DoseSafety Limits: What are they? How are they determined?Much of the discussion concerning radiation levels and radioactive material releases has been presented in the context of safety limits set by a regulator. Examples of such limits include the I-131 limit for drinking water (210 Bq/L) {Banana = 120 Bq/Kg}  or an annual occupational radiation dose limit (0.05 Sv){=50 mSV note: it is 50*1mSV} . What is often left out of these discussions is how these limits were determined and what exceeding a limit implies. {This seem to be much misunderstood concept here , IMO - people panic if the dose is higher than limit} This post is intended to provide a general description of the implications of safety limits.What is a Safety Limit and how are Safety Limits determined?Safety limits are designed to protect the public from a potential harm and are often set well below the point of potential danger to prevent that point of danger from being accidentally reached. Safety Limits are determined in two steps. First, by identifying the amount of exposure to any given agent, above which causes a health effect to be observed. This amount is determined for the most vulnerable members of the population, and considers the effects of both short and long-term exposure. That resulting number is then divided by a safety factor to ensure that the public is never exposed to dangerous levels. The reason for the safety factor is so the regulator will have time to fix the problem before the levels reach a point that can cause harm to the public, if for whatever reason, the safety limit is exceeded. The more uncertain the dividing line between safety and harm is, the larger the safety factor used to protect the public.Key Principles of Radiation Protection at Low Radiation ExposureThe probabilistic nature of low-dose radiation health effects makes it impossible to derive a clear distinction between ‘safe’ and ‘dangerous’ level of radiation. This also creates difficulties in explaining the control of radiation risks. The major policy implication is that some finite risk, however small, must be assumed and a level of protection established based on what is deemed acceptable. This leads to a system of protection based on three key principles recognized by the International Commission of Radiation Protection (ICRP) and endorsed by the US National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement (NCRP) and all other national agencies: -          Principle of Justification, based on the analysis of benefit versus risk of exposure;-          Principle of Optimization of Exposure, based on the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle;-          Principle of limitation of exposure to any person; The ICRP, in its latest Recommendations on Radiological Protection, stated that for radiation doses below around 100 mSv in a year,{where did we hear this 100 mSv before  } the increase in the incidence of stochastic effects is assumed to occur with a small probability and in proportion to the increase in radiation dose over the background dose. The use of this so-called linear-non-threshold (LNT) model is considered by the ICRP and by NCRP the best practical approach to managing risk from radiation exposure and commensurate with precautionary principle, being a prudent basis for radiological protection at low doses and low dose rates. However, uncertainties on the over-conservatism on this judgment are recognized by the ICRP and the NCRP, which have stated the need for further evaluation based on new research results.  {most experts do not subscribe to LNT, specially at levels less than 100 mSv} Despite the fact that the actual onset of latent cancer and other long term effects in relationship to radioactivity exposure is unknown, we do know that those effects are not statistically significant at very low doses. In simpler terms, the number of cancers caused by exposure to low doses of radiation is so small that we can’t sort it out from the noise – the natural rate of cancer incidence.In 1980, the US National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement (NCRP) published a report examining and quantifying the dose rate effect.  In examining all laboratory data regarding tumor induction published at that time, they found that lowering the dose rate from acute (eg 180 mSv/hr) to about 4.8 mSv/hr reduced the rate of tumor generation by an average factor of 4. They called this the ‘dose rate effectiveness factor’, DREF.   When the irradiations were much longer term irradiations, comprising “a significant or sizeable fraction of the life span” an even larger reduction in effect was observed, an average of a factor of 10; this was called the ‘protraction factor’ (PF). {yeah.. those comments like fourth root of time etc were not nonsense}  With few exceptions, the dose rates used in all of the laboratory studies cited in NCRP 64 used ‘low dose rates’ at least a factor of 4000 times higher than normal background dose rates. It is the results of these experiments and others like them, plus corresponding safety factors, which are used to establish regulatory limits on dose and dose rate to the general public.However, what is of interest today in Japan are dose-rates more like 10, 30, or 100 times background.  What about these dose rates?  The problem noted by the NCRP was that deleterious effects of these very low dose rates could not be observed. In fact, low doses and low dose rates led to increased longevity rather than the decreased lifespan seen at higher doses and dose rates.  In addressing the apparent life lengthening at low dose rates, the NCRP interpreted this effect as reflecting “a favorable response to low grade injury leading to some degree of systemic stimulation.”  They go on to state that “…there appears to be little doubt that mean life span in some animal populations exposed to low level radiation throughout their lifetimes is longer than that of the un-irradiated control population.” In the future, the accurate examination of residents of high background radiation areas around the world might generate the needed information on this phenomenon, which is termed “radiation hormesis”. Based on the presently available data, residents of high background radiation areas (sizeable population is exposed up to 20 mSv per year from natural background) do not appear to suffer adverse effects from these doses.Areas characterized with background radiation significantly higher than average can be found in Iran, Brazil, India, Australia and China. In the U.S., the population of Denver receives more than 10 mSv per year from natural background.  {Something to think about for those who think anything over 1mSv will be fatal} "

Still, acquisition and deployment is caught up in Babu politics (I know this first hand because I know a Babu involved in the negotiations). This chalta hai attitude of Babudom has killed thousands in the meantime.2. Indian airports still don't have the latest and greatest automatic landing systems (ALS) that money can buy (except perhaps Dilli and Mumbai).  I believe it is called Cat 3 or something. I don't think that it has killed many people but it is an accident waiting to happen.  Why are the Babus not working overtime to correct this problem?3. We have already discussed the case of coal fires and the general free pass that the coal industry is getting with respect to environmental destruction. India is probably the only country with a Minister for Coal (maybe a state minister now?). What the heck does this ministry do besides collecting bribes?4. Road accidents. AFAIK, India has the highest fatality rate in the world when normalized to number of vehicles.  Case in point is the new shiny Delhi-Gurgaon expressway which has the well documented design flaw in terms of not having enough pedestrian overbridges.  The DGE is busy killing people, it gets reported in the papers and Babus just do a ho-hum.5. Drinking water. No need to tell you that water supply is disgusting in all Indian cities.  Has there been a study of how many infant deaths are caused by water-borne diseases? I am sure someone has data on this. What are the Babus doing about it? Who is responsible for this systematic murder?6. Bhopal.  Yes, the big bad one.

But it went with the construction of the steel sheet wall and the so-called silt fence to allay environmental concerns that have been raised domestically and internationally.Radioactive iodine reading was 63,000 times the legal limit in seawater near the intake a day after contaminated water stopped leaking into the sea.Along with efforts to stop the leakage of toxic water, TEPCO also released about 9,000 tons of water containing relatively low-level radioactive materials into the Pacific, saying the massive amount of such water in the premises slowed the work to get the plant under control."

It denies any possibility that the water could overflow from the tunnel.The source of the contaminated water has not been identified.TEPCO plans to transfer the waste water either to a processing facility for nuclear waste or turbine condensers depending on the progress in current operations.The company also continues discharging less-radioactive water into the ocean from the processing facility to make room for more-radioactive water.Some 7,700 tons of less-radioactive water have been released into the sea and the release of the remaining 800 tons is expected to come to an end on Saturday.In a separate operation to inject nitrogen gas into the containment vessel of the Number 1 reactor to prevent a possible hydrogen explosion, TEPCO plans to increase the purity of nitrogen gas from 98 percent to 99.98 percent.The plant operator says a strong aftershock on Thursday night did not damage any facilities of the compound, but the surface temperature of the Number 1 reactor rose sharply immediately after the tremor that hit northeastern Japan minutes before midnight.The reading stood at 223 degrees Celsius at 7 PM, but it rose nearly 40 degrees just after the quake. The temperature had fallen back to 240 degrees at 6 AM on Saturday.TEPCO says it will continue close monitoring as what caused the sudden rise in temperature is not known.The company also plans to fly an unmanned small helicopter equipped with an infrared camera over the plant to take pictures of facilities that it has been unable to check.

However, Fukushima Prefecture is completely different from the two other areas in that nobody is seen in some of these devastated areas.In Okushiri and Aceh, people began to restore the tsunami-ravaged areas immediately after the disasters, demonstrating people's strong willpower. In Fukushima, however, residents near the nuclear plant cannot approach their neighborhoods out of fear that they would be exposed to radiation leaking from the plant.Over several days from the March 11 disaster, more lives could have been saved in Fukushima if the nuclear plant had remained intact. Many people were actually rescued in Miyagi and Iwate prefectures over the same period, but high levels of radiation prevented rescue workers from entering areas near the Fukushima plant. One cannot help but wonder how local residents felt about the situation that prevented search and rescue operations.The crisis at the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant has also caused enormous damage to local farmers and fishermen, which can be called destruction of their livelihoods. More sadly, however, many local residents were prevented from identifying the bodies of their family members. Those who have lost their lives have been abandoned near the plant.

Because of their few companies in the electronics, consumer electronics and automobiles a reputation of very high quality and build is associated with japan and everything built in japan. But as the high rate of recall of Japanese automobiles show, for example toyota and maruti suzuki recently, this is not actually the case. Granted that on an average a Japanese product is of superior quality than its say Korean or Indian counterpart. Further the nuclear industry is a different beast. Just because a company X in Japan makes the worlds best cars and is the worlds biggest car manufacturer, does not imply that company Y in Japan which is engaged in nuclear industry will have a similar and high standard. The operator of the Fukushima had some very basic design flaws. They put the generators on the ground level. They put the backup supply very near to the ground. And worse they did not consider the combination of an earthquake and tusnami, even after the deadly sumatra tsunami of early 2000s. The reactor was meant to withstand the earthquake and that it did. What it was not designed to withstand was the 10 feet high waves. This is a design flaw. If the generators had been put on higher ground or the backup supply had been put on an elevated area, we would not be seeing this horror unfold in front of us. We in India did that, specifically with reactors in TN. The point I am making over here, is that let us not associate the high quality of Japanese consumer electronics or certain other products with its nuclear reactors. Japan may have made tremendous technical progress, but this progress hides a thousand flaws. Japanese are not perfect. We should not live under the assumption that what happened in Japan will automatically happen over here or worse will happen over here."

Nuclear power has contributed to expanding the supply of energy and has also reduced greenhouse gas and other emissions,   A side meeting about the events in Japan and the initial response from safety regulators around the world included presentations by specialists from Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA), Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), and representatives from USA and European nuclear regulatory bodies. In a press conference following the event, US Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman Gregory Jaczko, Western European Nuclear Regulators' Association (WENRA) chairman Jukka Laaksonen and European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (NSREG) chairman Andrej Stritar all offered reassurances about the safety of the operating nuclear plants in their countries to current standards.

Continued exposure to that dosage even for a whole year would be less radiation than one CT scan.Worth quoting in full..It is almost a month since multiple disaster struck Japan. Yet not a single member of the public has been reported killed by radioactivity from the nuclear reactor complex in Fukushima. Meanwhile, estimates of the death toll due to the direct onslaught of the tsunami and the earthquake have long crossed 10,000 with many more injured and rendered homeless. Despite this, the radioactivity leaking out from Fukushima has received as much attention from the news media, the public and the governments of the world as the plight of the quake-tsunami victims. Such is the grip of the fear of radioactivity on the public! Is this level of fear warranted by objective facts?Well, there is no denying that radioactivity can be extremely hazardous. A large dose of 10,000 milli-sieverts or more will kill you in days, and even a tenth of that dose can lead to acute radiation sickness of various ghastly forms. Even much smaller doses can increase the chances of your getting cancer. Therefore, whenever there is any mishap involving things nuclear, one can well understand the public's anxiety.If the anxiety has often been excessive, one must try to understand why, rather than blame the public. There is a scary mysteriousness to nuclear radiation. It can penetrate the body, destroy internal organs, cause cancer and induce grotesque birth defects. Yet it is invisible, has no smell or colour. There are few immediate signs, apart from skin burns, of the terrible damage done to the interior of the body. The inability to detect nuclear radiation with the human senses, and the possibility of dreadful after-effects developing years later, has created an almost irrational dread in people's minds.Adding to the mystification is the genuine difficulty in determining, in quantitative scientific terms, how much damage small radiation doses can do. Fatalities due to high doses are less in dispute, although fewer in reactor accidents. In the worst reactor explosion in history, at Chernobyl, altogether 62 people died from high doses in the vicinity. Astonishingly, these 62 (which include 34 workers sent into the reactor to control the damage) were the only fatalities that could be unambiguously attributed to radiation from Chernobyl. Undoubtedly Chernobyl killed many more people, but most would have died of cancer due to smaller doses farther away. The difficulty lies in estimating how many. A U.N. Chernobyl Forum study estimated about 4000 deaths over the years worldwide due to the fallout from Chernobyl. But this has been hotly disputed by others, some with estimates in the lakhs. Such disparities arise because low-dose induced cancers can develop slowly over years, and cannot be empirically distinguished from the much larger background of total cancer deaths due to other factors — various natural causes, tobacco, pesticides etc. Theoretically too, the no-threshold linear model, which would predict a larger death toll, is not universally accepted by all biologists. {Actually I have seen NO reputable scientist who accepts it - it is called ""hypothesis"" with no data to support it to make it acceptable} Unfortunately, this vast uncertainty is a fertile ground for unsubstantiated wild claims.The response to Fukushima illustrates this. While the fears of people living in Japan about radioactive contamination are well justified, the level of anxiety in the rest of the world has been quite disproportionate to the actual threat. In Delhi, SMS messages were circulated warning people not to go out in the rain lest they be showered by radioactivity coming from Japan. In China, people started consuming iodised salt in large and potentially harmful quantities. Eventually, the WHO was compelled to call for calm on its Twitter page. Much farther away, drug stores in Russia's Far East and British Columbia have reported shortages of iodine pills. Californians, always game for health paranoia, also joined in stocking up with iodine pills. The news media, while reporting traces of fallout at various distant places, typically fail to mention how small those doses are. In fact the fallout from Fukushima in California was minuscule, as could have been predicted in advance. The Chernobyl fallout has been studied extensively and what fell on the U.K. was less dangerous, cancer-wise, than smoking a cigarette a year. In the Fukushima case, the radiation measured even as near as 50 km from the plant was 0.1 to 0.7 micro-seiverts/ hour. Continued exposure to that dosage even for a whole year would be less radiation than one CT scan.The public is not expected to have expertise in radiation hazards, and cannot be blamed if it fears radiation dangers excessively. But governments and others who shape public opinion can be blamed. Unfortunately, sometimes they too pander to populist fears. For example, the German Foreign Minister described Fukushima, even as it was unfolding, as an “Apocalypse”. This was clearly an extreme assessment. Not even the Chernobyl disaster, much worse than Fukushima, could be termed an Apocalypse. The Germans promptly shut down seven of their older reactors despite having earlier decided to extend their lifetimes, which they must have no doubt done after a full review of their condition and safety features. Nothing happened at Fukushima to warrant reversing their own decision.The Fukushima reactor explosions were caused, not by their age, condition or poor maintenance, but from a failure outside the reactor system — a disruption, due to the quake, of electric supply needed to pump water to cool the fuel rods. In fact the physical structures of all six reactors at Fukushima seem to have survived the direct onslaught of an 8.9 level earthquake followed by a giant Tsunami — a testimony to their sturdiness.There is also much speculation that the Fukushima disaster will, or should, stop the emerging nuclear renaissance. That again would be a retrograde step. We are not blindly advocating nuclear energy here, as against wind, solar and other renewable sources, nor claiming that it will substantially mitigate global warming. Admittedly, these are all debatable. Public discussion on them has been going on for years. And the pros and cons are well known. Countries like India and China have decided, in the face of those pros and cons, to expand the nuclear sector to meet their energy requirements. The point is that, as we have argued already, the events in Fukushima do not fundamentally alter those arguments and do not call for changing that decision.This is not to say that there are no lessons to be learnt from Fukushima. Indeed there are several. Criteria for locating reactors in areas prone to natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis and hurricanes should be made even more stringent. In designing backup systems, as for instance in cooling the reactor, one should try to ensure that the different layers of back-up are not vulnerable to the same external disaster. Their utility as backups then fails, as happened in Fukushima. The problem of over-pressurisation in containment vessels and the resultant need to vent radioactive gases has to be addressed more stringently.Turning to India, the Fukushima explosions should be taken as an opportunity to review and tighten up safety measures at all nuclear facilities. This our government is doing. We have to specially double-check the quake-resistance of the Narora plant and perhaps consider shifting the Jaitapur plant to a less earthquake prone zone. We should ensure that in the government's desire to rapidly expand our nuclear capacity, matters of safety are not compromised.Finally, this is a good opportunity to demand greater transparency from nuclear establishments all over the world. This is overdue. The Fukushima disaster demonstrates the lack of credibility of nuclear agencies in the public's mind, as evidenced by the latter's lack of faith in official assurances. This is not an easy problem to solve. We live in an age where people want the benefits of extremely complex technology, but are also suspicious of it. In India our government as well as social activists must be proactive in educating the public about nuclear hazards, but in a responsible and balanced manner. Neither bland assurances nor the stoking of hysterical fears will serve the public good.(R. Rajaraman is Emeritus Professor, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, and Co-Chair, International Panel on Fissile Materials.)Some thing along the line I and others have posted here..."

The seriousness of the damage there will require months of effort to minimize health and environmental risks of radiation releases.Modernity demands faith in man's mastery of the elements but the sheer devastation reminds us of our human and technological limitations.One question that has repeatedly arisen is how Japan, with its technological prowess, could find itself in a situation of so much uncertainty.More than 10 days passed without offsite electricity to the plants at Fukushima Daiichi, which limited the amount of critical information about the status of water levels in some reactors and spent fuel pools. Lack of electricity and rising radiation levels have hampered the restoration effort.Many observers, both in Japan and abroad, have raised questions about the extent of what Tokyo Electric Power Company knew and what information it released.But nuclear accidents, like wars, have their own ''fog.'' It was only many months later at Three Mile Island that officials realized how much of the reactor core had melted at Unit 2.Lack of information and invisible threats like radiation raise fears in the public. Governments that license nuclear power plants have an obligation to educate their publics about the risks and benefits, in equal measure.Part of that obligation is to find real solutions to nuclear waste.Reprocessing spent fuel in a quixotic quest for energy independence which is unattainable in an interdependent world has significant costs -- financial, environmental and those related to nuclear security.For too long, nuclear energy proponents have indulged in a faith-based support of the technology.As Japan ponders its energy future, it is time to make informed choices and rational actions about the kind of energy that is truly sustainable, at costs that are acceptable to the public.(Sharon Squassoni serves as director and senior fellow of the Proliferation Prevention Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.)"

1400,Amber G.,09 Apr 2011 23:18 ,"chaanakya wrote: In fact, low doses and low dose rates led to increased longevity rather than the decreased lifespan seen at higher doses and dose rates. In addressing the apparent life lengthening at low dose rates, the NCRP interpreted this effect as reflecting “a favorable response to low grade injury leading to some degree of systemic stimulation.” They go on to state that “…there appears to be little doubt that mean life span in some animal populations exposed to low level radiation throughout their lifetimes is longer than that of the un-irradiated control population.” Next stage is to Market Radium Water Tonic and other products for Longevity. Not a new idea . of course duly diluted .  Fukushima water??Before the spin becomes absurd, let me make a few obvious points:First, the study  (low doses and low dose rates leading to increased longevity) is well known, well published result. Unlike LNT (which is just a hypothesis at low doses, with absolutely NO supporting  concluding type of data ), the above mentioned  study is based on data. (For those who do not read ""fine print"" the studies which have come out saying '1,000,000 million people died due to TMI (or Chernobyl) are not based on actual deaths counted but just based on radiation measurements and the extrapolation of LNT model - if the model is correct we have so many deaths.. never mind they can not associate a SINGLE death with TMI radiation - even after 30 years and studies after studies..) Also, BTW, as everyone knows, if it were not for radiation induced (due to cosmic rays)  mutation, there would be no evolution. /smile/ *****But let me come to  a more important point here.   Vina called them village idiots - those who believed that all the 'bijili' was taken from the water. Let me call them SCQ (scientifically-challenged quacks).Those who had 'radium water"" were the ones who were SCQ, who went and believed radiation is good for them. Scientists like me tried to talk sense to them but they believed  what they believed,  and kept drinking that water, till many died of bladder cancers and govt finally banned those things. Make NO MISTAKE, Those SCQ were NO dumber than the the present SCQ, who again believe,  mock and insults, but think 1mSV will be fatal and will not opt for 8mSV CT scan even if it saved their life. They are scared that 200 Bq/l I-131 is found in water,  and they will rather die of heart-attack due to fear than try to understand what that dose means.  Thank god, Japan do not have these SCQ, otherwise they would have panicked.. and we all know panic may cause stampede which has been known to kill.(SCQ's in one case did panic (SA case where hundreds panicked because of fear of radiation, not unlike some postors here) and caused more damage than radiation did)The same kind of SCQ will not give vaccine to their children because of similar fear. The believe they know all they need to know about how evil those vaccines are. The big difference between sane people and SCQ's are:Sane people listened (and applied their own 'swayam pragya') and knew not to drink 'radium water', but will not panic and stampede if they heard the radiation is 1 muSv/hr.SCQ's on the other hand will have no 'swayam pragya' (but will quote 'shastras') and do exactly the opposite."

1402,chaanakya,09 Apr 2011 23:30 ,"EDITORIAL:Overcoming the nuclear crisisThe crisis at Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant does not warrant optimism. Nuclear fuel in the cores of the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 reactors is believed to have been severely damaged. In the No. 4 reactor's storage, where spent nuclear fuel is kept, water evaporated at one point, and a hydrogen explosion released radioactive substances into the environment. The government should pay close attention to proposals made by 16 Japanese experts on nuclear power engineering, nuclear physics and radiology on April 1. It should mobilize all available means to mitigate the crisis.Tepco is cooling the reactors by pumping water into them by using pumps connected with external power sources. But it cannot stop highly radioactive water from flowing out of the reactors. The more water it pumps into the reactors, the more contaminated water flows outside. Apparently, components for containing radioactive water have been damaged. The No. 2 reactor's suppression pool is feared to have cracked.On land, the accumulated radiation level during 11 days from March 23 has reached 10.34 millisieverts in the town of Namie, Fukushima Prefecture, just outside the 30-km radius of Fukushima No. 1. Residents inside the zone should evacuate or stay indoors. If the accumulated level over several days reaches a range of 10 to 50 millisieverts, the government calls on residents to stay inside their homes to avoid radiation.The situation at Fukushima No. 1 is ""extremely serious"" and demands Japan's all-out efforts, the 16 experts said in their April 1 statement. Three of the 16 — Mr. Shiori Ishino, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, Mr. Shunichi Tanaka, former acting chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, and Mr. Shojiro Matsuura, former chairman of the Nuclear Safety Commission — explained the statement at the education and science ministry.Since those who signed the statement include former members of the AEC, a body that sets the nation's basic policy for development and use of nuclear power, the NSC, a body that sets the nation's basic nuclear safety policy, and scientists belonging to the Atomic Energy Society of Japan, the government and Tepco should share their sense of crisis and humbly follow their proposals.The 16 ""as people who have pushed peaceful use of nuclear power"" expressed their regret over the nuclear crisis and apologized to people. But they did not hide their fear that a critical situation may develop at Fukushima No. 1. They do not rule out the possibility that as time goes on, a molten core melts a weak part of a pressure vessel and enters a containment vessel, destroying the reactor's function to contain radioactive substances, or that hydrogen gas forming inside a pressure vessel explodes and destroys a containment vessel, causing serious radioactive contamination over a large expanse of land and sea. They warn that release of a large amount of radioactive substances could make uninhabitable not only the current evacuation zone but also larger areas.Mr. Tanaka and others said that the current makeshift efforts to cool the No. 1, 2 and 3 reactors will not be able to completely cool down molten nuclear fuel so as it will not burst through the bottom of pressure vessels. They also said the three reactors contain a much larger amount of radioactive substances than the Chernobyl nuclear plant did.The points made by the statement include: (1) utmost efforts must be made to both prevent the release of a large amount of radioactive substances and to reactivate the residual heat removal system which internally circulates water to cool reactors and spent fuel storages, (2) spent nuclear fuel must be completely immersed in water, (3) detailed measurement of radioactivity both in the air and the soil in various areas and assessment of their effects must be announced so that area-specific measures can be taken and (4) residents should be fully informed before and after radioactive substances are vented from reactors.It adds that since hydrogen is forming all the time in the reactors, hydrogen explosions must be prevented at any cost.The statement also calls for (1)increasing personnel at Fukushima No. 1 to lower their exposure to radiation and to enable them to take enough rest and (2) setting up the headquarters for the crisis containing operations inside or near the plant site (so that headquarters personnel share the burden of radiation exposure and pain with on-site workers.)The 16 experts say it is essential to set up a system in which the NSC will take the lead in strategically and flexibly utilizing the knowledge and experience of Japan's nuclear authorities — including the Japan Atomic Energy Agency and the National Institute of Radiological Sciences — the power and related industries and universities to end the nuclear crisis. Prime Minister Naoto Kan must exercise strong leadership in setting up this system as soon as possible.Looks like their own scientists are having serious thoughts.Few things seems  established so farSuch as Core is partially melted.Scientists  apprehend that molten core would breach primary containment.Spent fuel is partially or even fully exposed.Cooling efforts are not yielding proper results.The premises inside plant is highly radioactive , to the extent, that it is hampering efforts to contain the crisis.There is news item that workers have refused to accept higher dose limit for Nuclear emergency workers amid concerns on radiation hazard.1-4 reactor units are practically gone. Why Concreting tomb option is not exercised? Must be some reason as there is not hope to revive them.20 Km zone seems set to become uninhabitable? though not sure at present.Near sea area in fukushima  would be highly contaminated for a long time if cesium  isotopes are present as reported.Contamination cleanup would be a long term process.Decommissioning would take not less than 10 years with attendant costs.Ban on rice plantation etc is going to add to public perception  on radiation fall out.I am sure Japanese Govt knows what it is doing despite advice to the contrary."

The 86,180-kg pump designed by Wis.-based Putzmeister America Inc. comes mounted on a 26-wheel truck. Its extended boom can reach more than 60 meters, and can be operated from 3 km away by remote control, making it possible to shoot water into hard-to-reach places at the stricken plant.If necessary, the pump could also entomb a damaged nuclear reactor in concrete. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, Putzmeister sent 11 pumps to pour concrete over parts of the wrecked nuclear plant in Ukraine.Japanese authorities have struggled to cool the plant's reactors after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out its backup cooling systems. The facility has been rocked by explosions, spewed radiation and may have suffered a partial meltdown of its nuclear fuel."

1407,Theo_Fidel,10 Apr 2011 02:20 ,"A thrust fault earthquake is different from other earthquakes. A major reason for the huge energy numbers is the time duration of the Earthquake. This is how long it takes the earth to 'unzip' if you will. The Tohoku (official name) earthquake lasted 6-7 minutes. Also the epicenter was 30 km's or so deep. Something like 350 seconds. The real measure is the peak ground acceleration. This is what structures are designed for. From what I've seen the Peak ground acceleration at Tohoku was about 2.6 to 2.8 G's. This is a high but not an unusual number. You then design with some factor of safety say 1.5 included.To give you some reference the Christchurch 2011 Earthquake was a 6.3 but occurred shallow at 5 kms depth. The peak movement only lasted 12 seconds. Peak ground acceleration was 2.2 G's.Of course Fukushima itself would never experience such shaking as it is quite far from any possible epicenter. The reports indicate that an estimate of .3 G's was made by the company, but it will require a lot of analysis to see what the final map looks like. Couple of years at least. Remember that Thrust faults tend to move vertically a lot more, the cause of the Tsunami, so the actual horizontal number maybe much less.Much of California along the San Andreas is designed for at least 0.5 G's of horizontal acceleration. Many areas much much more. Strike/slip faults can produce much more horizontal movement at a modest energy release.What all this means is that while the number is huge in actual terms it is only a very long relatively high shaking event. The company itself has told that there was very little damage other than to instrumentation and sensors in the earthquake. The only real damage was from the Tsunami, variously estimated at 7-12 meters. The one that hit Kalpakkam was 10.2 meters or so.Bottom line is that similar ground shaking and Tsunami in localized areas have occurred with just 7.0 type earthquakes. The physical effects on the land were not very unusual. Don't get distracted by the big 9.0 number."

This is typical for structural engineering, not so much the energy released, but the actual acceleration and lateral velocity of the ground.  The nuclear power plants in California are designed for a sustained ground acceleration of 0.7 g or about 7 m/s^2.  See Peak Ground AccelerationAnd Mercalli Intensity ScaleNow note, the problems at Fukishima were not related to the ground acceleration or velocity, but the Tsunami causing back up power systems to fail.  As far as the reactors went, they survived the quake and tsunami.  Had there not been a tsunami, we probably wouldn't be having this discussion here.As far as those dead men walking, well, they probably disappeared along with few orders of magnitude. "

1414,abhishek_sharma,10 Apr 2011 09:57 ,"Q&A session From http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2011/04/japans_nuclear_disaster_live_q.html	Brian Owens: Hello, and welcome to our Q&A session on the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. We have Jim Smith, an environmental physicist from the University of Portsmouth and Geoff Brumfiel, Nature’s senior physical sciences correspondent with us to answer your questions....Brian Owens: To start off, we’ve had a couple of people asking about the safety of travelling to the region, including someone whose daughter is studying in Japan, and someone on their way to Korea. Jim, could you tell us a bit about the risks from radiation to travellers?Jim Smith: I guessed this would come up, so here's one I prepared earlier: There is no significant risk for travel to countries outside Japan – you’re likely to get a much higher radiation dose from cosmic rays on the flight over than you would from the radiation. Even in Japan, the risks of radiation are very very low. This is because (1) contaminated products are being kept out of the food supply (2) apart from in the area within, say 40-50km there isn’t a big risk from deposited radioactivity. (3) the radioactive iodine which is causing all the concern at the moment is decaying away. All of it will be gone within a few weeks. I’d be more worried about the disruption to services and anxiety caused by the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident.Brian Owens: Thanks Jim. Hope that help reassure nervous travellers. And one for Geoff. Peggy asks on the blog: Is there any practical typhoon and earthquake proof solution for storing the contaminated water needed to cool the fuel? What are the chances that leaks of highly contaminated water will worsen to the point that they will be unable to keep the fuel cool?geoff.brumfiel: So these are two million-dollar questions. Unfortunately, I'm not sure anyone can provide a very good answer at the moment. In the short-term, engineers at the plant are planning on using existing storage tanks to store highly radioactive water. To make room, they're dumping several thousand tons of slightly irradiated water into the Pacific. These containers are obviously somewhat earthquake and typhoon proof in the sense that they've just survived the biggest quake and tsunami in recent memory. But I don't think that necessarily makes them a good long-term solution.geoff.brumfiel: In terms of your second question: it's hard to predict the chances of leaks worsening, in part because we don't know how extensive the damage inside the plant actually is. TEPCO has recently sealed the worst leak (around unit 2), but they admit there may be others to deal with. Still, I think it's worth noting that for the past ten days or so, conditions inside the reactors seem to have been fairly stable.[Comment From Zoey] 1. Although there are high levels of Cesium 137 and Iodine 131 in the water around Japan many people believe that it is not cause for concern because of the ocean’s ability to vastly dilute what is put in it. Do you believe other countries should be concerned or do you agree that the ocean can fix it?Brian Owens: Jim, could you say somthing about that?Jim Smith: Yes, there is enormous dilution of radioactivity in the marine system. By the time any contamination got across the ocean to other countries (if any did), the concentrations would be tiny and wouldn’t present any risk. The concern for the marine system is mainly in the local area to Fukushima.geoff.brumfiel: I would add that a French team has done some modelling for the IAEA on this. It doesn't necessarily answer the question, but it gives a sense of how the material is dispersed: http://sirocco.omp.obs-mip.fr/outils/Sy ... iJapan.htm[Comment From Sonny Trench] What about contaminated fish that migrate?Brian Owens: A good question, I've wondered that myself.Brian Owens: Jim, any thoughts on fish that might leave the area?Jim Smith: That's a good question. Not sure what the fish species are in the region and how far they might migrate. If they were in the contaminated region for a long time (it takes time for radioactivity to get up the aquatic food chain into fish) they might get contaminated. During migration they would lose some of that as they expel it as well (I-131 would all go by decay) but some Cs-137 could remain. Guess they'll have to monitor migratory species if there are any.Brian Owens: While we wait for Jim's answer, here's another question for Geoff[Comment From Magdeline Lum] How long do you expect the Fukushima situation to continue to be in play? The mainstream media has played it out like a disaster movie and now seemed to be lost as to what to do now that there isn't a foreseeable conclusion.geoff.brumfiel: To be fair to the media Magdeline, I think everyone's at a loss right now. The situation at the reactors is unpredictable and the next steps are far from clear. What we can say is this: the situation at Fukushima is going to be with us for years. First, the reactors will need to be brought under control, but then they'll need to be cleaned up, and that is going to be very difficult...geoff.brumfiel: I was looking at the British Windscale accident earlier today, which occured in 1957. Cleanup is still underway. Three Mile Island took 14 years. I'm not sure where Fukushima fits, but it's going to be over a decade. Probably many decades.[Comment From Senkei Umehara] What is the major source of information for you guys outside Japan? I'm in Tokyo and know foreign press is invited to conferences, but concern how frequently they get updated.Jim Smith: Re: migratory fish again. There was a similar concern after Chernobyl about migratory birds. As I remember, radioactivity was measured in migratory birds in countries far from Chernobyl, though as far as I know this didn't cause problems for the food chain.Jim Smith: Brian - think you missed off the first part of my answer about migratory fish.geoff.brumfiel: In answer to Senkei: Actually the Japanese agencies have done a pretty good job of translating material into English. And in the past few days Chief Cabinet secretary Yukio Edano's press conferences have also been webcast with translation. So there's lots of primary source information out there. How reliable it all is is another question entirely...Brian Owens: We’ve also had several questions here and on the blog about the safety of food and milk in Japan. Jim, could you give us your thoughts on that?Jim Smith: As I said in my answer about travel above - I don’t think there will be significant risks from ingesting contaminated food/milk/water in Japan. Levels in water are now very low, and the Japanese authorities are working hard to keep contaminated products out of the food supply chain. That will be a difficult job given the that they are also dealing with an earthquake and tsunami. I couldn’t say for sure that some “contaminated” products won’t slip through the net, but I would emphasise that the risks from consuming some products above limits are still very low. The limits are set so that products can be consumed at that level for a long time. So if somebody were to inadvertently eat products above the level, it doesn’t mean that they would get an unsafe dose.[Comment From Drew Wight] Moving forward, how can nuclear power facilities (particularly in earthquake prone areas) be designed differently to withstand seismic activity?geoff.brumfiel: Many of the newer designs are supposed to be ""passively safe"" meaning that, even if the control room is completely destroyed or incapacitated, the reactor will cool itself down on its own.I think a much more difficult question is how to make existing reactors safer. In the case of Fukushima Dai-Ichi, the position of the diesel backup generators relative to the coast was clearly a problem. I imagine regulators world wide will be looking at the number and state of various back up systems to see if they can be improved.[Comment From Lizzie] Is there any great difference in the effect of having ingested radiation (fish, kelp) versus having been externally exposed to it?Brian Owens: Jim, your thoughts?Jim Smith: The main difference is that it stays in your body for some time. This is taken account of in the risk models. For example Cs-137 is excreted from the body over a period of months, I-131 much faster. Some people also think there is a bigger risk because the radioactivity is inside you. I don't agree. The distinction between “internal”and “external” emitters is a bit false. An X-ray or external gamma ray causes the production of high speed electrons in the body in the same way as internal emitters do. It’s the high speed electrons which cause ionisation, potentially leading to DNA damage and cancer - it doesn't matter where they originate.[Comment From Chinju Park] If it takes over decades, does it mean that the spreading of radioactive materials continue during that time?geoff.brumfiel: Jim may have some thoughts on this too, but no, I don't think we need to be worried about the continuous spreading of radiation. For one thing, the fuel will continue to cool down in the coming years, and will be far less dangerous than it is now. For another, engineers should be able to come up with some measures to reduce the spread of any radiation that does escape. I've already seen that TEPCO is spraying resin on the site to keep radioactive dust down, for example.That doesn't mean that there couldn't be a significant release further down the road, but overall, I expect that the radiation will decline at the site.Jim, anything to add?Jim Smith: Radioactive Cs-137 is held in soil for decades (the amount halves every 30 years). It doesn't spread too far - tiny amounts are spread by the wind and water. As the reactors are now (hopefully) much more stable, the problem for the land system is the radioactivity that is already out there in the soil.[Comment From Kris] The fuel rods in Unit 1 has been reported to have exposed up to 70% and they are trying to dilute the hydrogen concentration by incubating Nitrogen. This means that the cooling of unit 1 has been failing... possibly by build up of salt (no water circulation). In your opinion(s) what would be the worst case scenario for this?Brian Owens: Jim and Geoff both might have ideas about this.geoff.brumfiel: We talked a little about that in a story I wrote earlier this week (http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110405/ ... 1.211.html). Basically if cooling has failed, then there's a chance that the core has melted partially or entirely through the reactor and ended up in the concrete drywell below. That would mean a longer, costlier and more dangerous cleanup. Another danger is that there is some transient power-producing fission inside the reactor, or that the reactor could inadvertently restart. That could be a real problem (obviously) both in terms of radiation release and managing the accident. But the evidence that this has happened is slim for now. As I said earlier up, things appear stable.geoff.brumfiel: Actually, I should qualify that: we don't really know what's happening in the reactors, but for now it looks stable...Jim Smith: I'll leave that one to Geoff...[Comment From Yuri] Could you explain the similarities and differences between Fukushima and Chernobyl in regard to the spread pattern and the speed of radioactive substances to the surrounding soil and ocean?Brian Owens: Jim, you wrote a book about Chernobyl, any thoughts on how these two compare?Jim Smith: Chernobyl didn't significantly affect marine systems - there was radioactivity in the Baltic and Black seas (both a long way away) but concentrations were much lower. At Fukushima, the marine system is obviously a greater concern. There are similarities between the depositions from Fukushima and Chernobyl. We're concerned mainly about the same radionuclides - iodine and caesium. Though, at Chernobyl the explosion and major breach of primary containment spread ""hot particles"" within about a 10 km area. So the near zone of Chernobyl was contaminated with plutonium, strontium and other radionuclides which are much less volatile than Caesium and Iodine[Comment From Brendan] Are there any plans to move radioactive material from Fukushima at this time to a long term storage facility (are there reasonable options)? Or will the material have to just sit there in perpetuity?geoff.brumfiel: This is a really good question Brendan. I haven't heard of any plans as of yet, but it seems to me that they may want to think about moving the material at some stage, as it's obviously in a risky location. Realistically, it will probably be years before they can do anything. They've got to wait for the fuel to cool.[Comment From Adam F] At Chernobyl they encased the reactor in a concrete tomb. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this sort of technique. Would it do more harm than good at Fukushima?geoff.brumfiel: I was speaking to somebody about this the other day. The risk of a big concrete tomb is that it would have to be there for decades, even a century. Given the seismic and other environmental risks in the region, I think it would be extremely difficult to go down the sarcophagus route. Jim may have other thoughts.Jim Smith: That makes sense to me, though it makes it more difficult to decommission when that starts.[Comment From Howard] Is the neutron beam that has been reported a sign of fission on the site? What is the best and worst case situation concerning that release of neutrons?geoff.brumfiel: Ah yes, the mysterious ""neutron beam"". First of all, it's almost certainly a translation problem: they more likely mean a neutron ""burst"". Second, most of the physicists I've spoken to have disregarded the reports of neutron beams near the site. There are (roughly) three reasons: 1.	Neutrons are extremely difficult to detect, so it would be a tough measurement.2.	The readings are fairly low, and could be caused by noise from the much higher levels of gamma radiation on the site.3.	It just doesn't make sense. The readings are far from the buildings. It's hard to understand why neutrons would be making it out of the containment vessel, even if they are being released.That said, there's definitely neutron activity in these reactors as a result of other fission products in the fuel and it's certainly dangerous.Jim Smith:  If there was fission going on, you would also see some evidence in very short-lived fission products appearing in air and water monitoring data - I haven't seen any clear evidence of this yet, though I haven't seen much air monitoring data at the site.[Comment From Aya Diab] Jim, In your view, how will this accident affect the nuclear renaissance?Jim Smith: Good question. I think it's too early to discuss this question, and was surprised that some politicians have started to do so whilst we're still in the middle of an accidental situation. I'm going to give you my immediate reaction, though. I'm an environmental scientist and (believe it or not) after 20 years of studying Chernobyl and even with Fukushima going on, I'm still pro-nuclear. I think we need nuclear as well as renewables to provide an electricity supply which is low in CO2 emissions and as a security of supply of raw material (uranium and plutonium) for the coming decades at least.[Comment From Stuart McIntosh] In addition to Drew Wight's question, do you think that countries susceptible to earthquakes and tsunamis should adopt other methods of obtaining energy?Brian Owens: A follow-up to the nuclear renaissance question.Jim Smith: That's also a good question, but one which I would leave until we're past the immediate accidental stage and we can start to learn the lessons from Fukushima. As Geoff pointed out, though, modern reactor designs are much better...geoff.brumfiel: All nuclear reactors are built with certain risks in mind, and its worth pointing out that the nuclear reactors at Fukushima were faced with a disaster far worse than they were designed to withstand and (more-or-less) have survived in one piece.That being said, I think this is a question that regulators and the public in many countries will have to answer in coming years. Indeed, we're already seeing a lively debate in countries like Germany.[Comment From Shelby] Most of the radiation readings around the 19km zone have been made in a somewhat less than scientific manner, often driving around from point to point, not including critical details such as wind direction at the time of reading. Can we trust these readings to be accurate when large swings from high readings to low readings could be attributed to things like wind direction or the large areas between reading sites? It would seem we only have a vague idea at best of the actual dumping of radioactive particles over this vast area.Brian Owens: There has been a lot of debate over the quality of data available, Jim, Geoff, any thoughts?geoff.brumfiel: I'll let Jim go first, then add a comment...Jim Smith: In the early stages (i.e. when the contaminated material is in the air) the readings will be very dependent on things like wind direction, and will vary a lot. But once the radioactivity is deposited on the ground, the wind direction won't affect the readings. Soil moisture will, and I notice that the readings say whether it is raining or not, but it doesn't make too much difference. Generally I'm happy with the data, but sometimes it's been difficult to interpret because, as you say, there needs to be more accompanying information on methods etc. This may be a problem of translation - maybe the Japanese version is more complete.geoff.brumfiel: The US Department of Energy has done some surveying with aircraft that provide a pretty good picture of where the radiation has spread: http://blog.energy.gov/content/situation-japan/Beyond that, I'd add that, to be fair, this is a really tough situation. It's easy to second-guess the Japanese, and indeed it's worthwhile to do so in many cases. But we shouldn't forget that, especially in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, instrumentation was limited, as was access to the region.Brian Owens: We're almost out of time, so just a couple more questions I think. First, one for Jim:Jim Smith: I'd agree with Geoff on that - I wouldn't criticise the Japanese given what they have to deal with.[Comment From Claire Cailes] How does any increase in cancer risk from exposure to Fukushima radioactive contamination compare to other cancer risks such as smoking?Jim Smith: Certainly much lower. As an example, the radiation dose to the Chernobyl clean up workers was about 100 mSv on average. That translates to about a 0.5-1 % additional risk of fatal cancer in later life. Continual smokers have about a 50% chance of dying from a smoking related illness.[Comment From Chris Pook] There is lots of data out there, and the Japanese are making absolutley everything available, but the big gap is the interpretation and trend line, and most importantly how this translates into regulatory decisons, e,g on food stuffs. Any thoughts on the best parameters for making these decisions?Brian Owens: Jim, what information do policymakers need to make these important decisions?geoff.brumfiel: The one thing I'd say is that I've noticed a real problem in how the press has reported on the crisis: they tend to give peak values. Especially because the danger from radiation depends on exposure over time, I don't think these numbers are always very helpful. Indeed, a low, but steady reading can be more dangerous than a brief peak.geoff.brumfiel: Beyond that, it's probably a better question for Jim to answer...Jim Smith: Yes, there are guideline limits for radioactivity in the event of a nuclear accident. So there are limits which are being used by Japan to check their foodstuffs against. But these are difficult to interpret, as Geoff says, which makes them open to misinterpretation by the media. One important trend that is emerging from the data, though, is that the external radiation dose rates in the contaminated areas are falling rapidly in this early stage because short lived isotopes - Te-132 and I-131 are decaying.Brian Owens: One final question, then we'll have to go.[Comment From Ian] Is there an international watchdog that inspects nuclear power stations or are such inspections left to national regulatory control? Clearly there seems to have been a lack or insight into risks that perhaps could have been forseen.Brian Owens: Geoff and Jim, your thoughts on international coordination?geoff.brumfiel: The International Atomic Energy Agency has some authority to inspect civilian nuclear reactors, but mainly it's just to ensure that they are not being used for nuclear weapons development or other covert purposes. I imagine that some people will ask whether their authority should be expanded in the aftermath of this accident.Jim Smith: Just what I was going to say...geoff.brumfiel: Ultimately, however, safety is likely to remain squarely in the hand of domestic regulators, for better or worse."

(TEPCO) adviser Toshiaki Enomoto is pictured at the company's Tokyo head office. (Mainichi)It may take 10 years to start removing damaged nuclear fuel from the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant, but the plant's operator is adamant not to bury the damaged reactors while fuel remains in them, a company official has told the Mainichi.""We will not bury the site while radioactive materials remain. We will definitely remove the fuel,"" Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) adviser Toshiaki Enomoto told the Mainichi in an interview, stressing that the company would not bury the reactors in concrete in a ""stone tomb"" approach like the one adopted at Chernobyl.TEPCO chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata has announced plans to decommission the plant's No. 1 through 4 reactors. Normally it takes 20 to 30 years to decommission a reactor, but the process at the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant is expected to take even longer as workers must start by developing specialized equipment to remove damaged fuel.Enomoto said that for the time being the ongoing process of injecting water into the No. 1, 2 and 3 reactors at the plant was essential.""There is no other option but to inject water. We want the fuel to stop melting,"" he said.The plant's residual heat removal system could take a month to get up and running again, Enomoto said. An additional cooling system will also be constructed but it is expected to take several months before the reactors can be brought to a cold stop.A facility to purify contaminated water responsible for radioactive leaks to a level where it can be released will be constructed from this month. At the same time measures will proceed to have radioactive material contained within the reactor buildings within a few months, Enomoto said. At this stage, evacuation orders applying to local bodies around the plant are expected to be reviewed.Enomoto said nuclear fuel at the plant could not be removed using conventional methods for two reasons: The reactor buildings are damaged, and measures are needed to prevent the spread of radiation; and 25 to 70 percent damage has occurred to the fuel rods in the No. 1, 2 and 3 reactors. New methods to remove the fuel must be developed, and it will take 10 years before workers can start removing fuel, he said.Commenting on TEPCO's response to the disaster, Enomoto said, ""Problems that we had not predicted happened one after another. Even inspecting the site has been difficult, and this accumulation of events has been responsible for the work not going as we have hoped.""The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that it took five years for workers to be able to open a pressurized container following the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station accident in March 1979, when about 45 percent of the nuclear reactor fuel melted. It was another six years before the removal of nuclear fuel was completed. Dismantling work has still not yet begun.Enomoto graduated from the University of Tokyo's Faculty of Engineering and entered TEPCO in 1965. He worked at the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant four times, including when the No. 1 reactor was started up on a trial basis in 1970. He resigned as executive vice president and head of the company's nuclear power headquarters in 2002 over the cover-up of nuclear reactor trouble."

Most literature says a 5 Sv total body dose is most likely fatal in the medium term. There are many good references (or just talk to someone in a nearby university)  to understand total body equivalent dose  concept. Basically : Gray is energy absorbed per unit mass. Sv  is a measure of  biological harm  it will produce. (Roughly speaking, for gamma rays 1Gy=1Sy .. more for neutrons, even more for  alpha particles..).. Some organs are more critical..so you integrate over the whole body giving proper weight factors to get effective total body dose. If each part of your body (average) got about 5 Sv it is likely (99%)  to be fatal (unless there is a very good hospital and you are lucky).For a typical radiation therapy patients (who may get 20-40 Sv for some parts of body) the equivalent total body radiation is (again rough number) is of the order of 2 Sv (this is when hair starts falling out - even though hair may not get any radiation /smile/ )    So there is no difference between a focused dose of radiation at a diseased tumor or a diffused dose all over the healthy body. The long term hazard for the patient is the same despite most of the targeted tissue dying off in the focused beam while the damaged tissue remains a part of the body in a diffused dose.I will not say 'no difference', but for long term cancer risks, doctors mainly worry about  (equivalent)  total body dose.Hope it helps."

This lack of certainty is part of what makes radiation so feared. We are able to deal with 100,000 road fatalities and move on because we know those accidents caused fatalities. We are not even certain of this with radiation. Makes the field 'appear' very shaky.Admittedly a statistical increase of 10% to 25% of cancers would be very hard to make out as they likely lie within the statistical error bars. From a research point of view you want an effect at least 3 factors larger than error bars. If your error bar is 20%, you effect must be 60% at least for you to be 100% certain there is a real effect.  From my point of view it would be very easy to 'spin' this one way or another. We know the number is not zero, until we know what the exact number should be we can only go with the linear hypothesis.By your number the linear hypothesis fatal dose is 25 Sv. I thought this was the old number and the new standard is 5 Sv.My thought is that those workers took quite a dose when the early air borne radiation levels were extremely high in the basement. Their flimsy body suits would not have helped them much. The sickness they suffered due to foot exposure maybe masking their total exposure level. TEPCO has admitted that very high levels have been measured in the basement initially.In any case my bottom line after Fukushima is that we have deeply underestimated the true chances of a major nuclear accident. We are likely to suffer a worst case catastrophe sooner rather than later. I would much rather it was not in India."

Why would you rely on the results of a model more when data shows otherwise.If the rates of incidence for cancer under normal conditions is same as with populations exposed to some low threshold of radiation, then for all practically measurable scenario the risks are not enhanced due to exposure at that level. It is as simple as that. So where is the issue to understand this."

For instance Radon gas in the home that can increase yearly back ground radiation by about 5-10 Millisievert per year is estimated by the EPA to cause 22,000 fatalities annually.

1439,Amber G.,11 Apr 2011 03:09 ,"My thought is that those workers took quite a dose when the early air borne radiation levels were extremely high in the basement. Their flimsy body suits would not have helped them much. The sickness they suffered due to foot exposure maybe masking their total exposure level. TEPCO has admitted that very high levels have been measured in the basement initially.I don't like the use of  the word 'air-borne' ( radiation). Gamma rays don't need air.I obviously don't know all the details,  but reading what I read, I don't believe they got high (or extremely high) dose from outside the water. If the rate was 1000mSv/hr.. they could not have stayed for more than a few minutes before the alarm on their dosimeter will go (trust me, one can not ignore that). In any case, if they got 2-4 Sv full body dose, it will be all but impossible to cover it up. ARS will set in.. hair will fall..and blood count could confirm much lower dose (anything above, say 1 Sv)..unless hospital and many others are covering it up.. heads will role and few people will end up in jail, IMO. From the reports,   their supervisors are already in trouble for not training them.(letting them go without protective footwear etc) .The sad part was, the workers were not well trained ( contractors).. and in all likelihood they did not suffer or noticed  any radiation sickness/danger (that's the danger part, you can't feel the radiation of  even that water).. I don't know if the water was hot of dirty but   they noticed their wet feet.   Lucky that someone realized the danger part (dose from wet feet will not register on the dosimeter)  and told them that it is serious, better get yourself checked.. etc..Bottom line: We still have no reason to believe that IAEA (or TEPCO) report that no one got more than 250 mSV is false."

This is another reason I think nuclear should not be for India. Our population density is far too high and to close to these plants.

I've worked on medium hardened data facilities that keep 7-14 days worth of battery backup.Running many industrial pumps takes far far more current than does a server farm.  Keep in mind, batteries in industrial operations are massive lead-acid type and require regular servicing.  Radioactivity became an issue since the operators had to vent steam.

They now claim that 985,000 people have been killed by Chernobyl, and that it will continue to slaughter people for generations to come. These claims are false.Like John Vidal and many others, Helen Caldicott pointed me to a book which claims that 985,000 people have died as a result of the disaster(14). Translated from Russian and published by the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, this is the only document which looks scientific and appears to support the wild claims made by greens about Chernobyl.A devastating review in the journal Radiation Protection Dosimetry points out that the book achieves its figure by the remarkable method of assuming that all increased deaths from a wide range of diseases – including many which have no known association with radiation – were caused by the accident(15). There is no basis for this assumption, not least because screening in many countries improved dramatically after the disaster and, since 1986, there have been massive changes in the former eastern bloc. The study makes no attempt to correlate exposure to radiation with the incidence of disease(16).Read it all..."

Dr Elisabeth Cardis, Head of the IARC Radiation Group, provided greater detail: ""By 2065 (i.e. in the eighty years following the accident), predictions based on these models indicate that about 16,000 cases3 of thyroid cancer and 25,000 cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident and that about 16,000 deaths from these cancers may occur.""Most of the cancer burden rests with the most exposed populations: ""About two-thirds of the thyroid cancer cases and at least one half of the other cancers are expected to occur in Belarus, Ukraine and the most contaminated territories of the Russian Federation"", she said. These are the three countries in proximity to the site of the accident.But she added: ""While these figures all reflect human suffering and death, they nevertheless represent only a very small fraction of the total number of cancers seen since the accident and expected in the future in Europe. Indeed, our analysis of the trends in cancer incidence and mortality does not demonstrate any increase that can be clearly attributed to the Chernobyl accident. The exception is thyroid cancer, which, over ten years ago, was already shown to be increased in the most contaminated regions around the site of the accident.""Dr Boyle concluded that ""This study is unique in that it applies state-of-the-art radiation risk projection models to updated estimates of radiation dose from Chernobyl throughout Europe, and also includes a comprehensive examination of trends in cancer incidence and mortality data. It provides the best estimates to date of the impact of the Chernobyl accident on cancer in Europe.

The plant at the Savannah River Site, once devoted to making plutonium for weapons, would now turn America’s lethal surplus to peaceful ends. Blended with uranium, the usual reactor fuel, the plutonium would be transformed into a new fuel called mixed oxide, or mox.“We are literally turning swords into plowshares,” one of the project’s biggest boosters, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said at a hearing on Capitol Hill last week.But 11 years after the government awarded a construction contract, the cost of the project has soared to nearly $5 billion. The vast concrete and steel structure is a half-finished hulk, and the government has yet to find a single customer, despite offers of lucrative subsidies.Now, the nuclear crisis in Japan has intensified a long-running conflict over the project’s rationale.One of the stricken Japanese reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant uses the mox fuel. And while there has been no evidence of dangerous radiation from plutonium in Japan, the situation there is volatile, and nuclear experts worry that a widespread release of radioactive material could increase cancer deaths.Against that backdrop, the South Carolina project has been thrown on the defensive, with would-be buyers distancing themselves and critics questioning its health risks and its ability to keep the plutonium out of terrorists’ hands.The most likely customer, the Tennessee Valley Authority, has been in discussions with the federal Department of Energy about using mox to replace a third of the regular uranium fuel in several reactors — a far greater concentration than at the stricken Japanese reactor, Fukushima Daiichi’s Unit No. 3, where 6 percent of the core is made out of mox. But the T.V.A. now says it will delay any decision until officials can see how the mox performed at Fukushima Daiichi, including how hot the fuel became and how badly it was damaged.“We are studying the ongoing events in Japan very closely,” said Ray Golden, a spokesman for the utility.At the same time, opponents of the South Carolina project scored a regulatory victory this month when a federal atomic licensing panel, citing “significant public safety and national security issues,” ordered new hearings on the plans for tracking and safeguarding the plutonium used at the plant.Obama administration officials say that mox is safe, and they remain confident that the project will attract customers once it is further along and can guarantee a steady fuel supply. Anne Harrington, who oversees nuclear nonproliferation programs for the Energy Department, noted that six countries besides Japan had licensed the routine use of mox fuel. She accused critics of “an opportunistic attempt” to score political points by seizing on Japan’s crisis.“Mox is nothing new,” she said.Even so, the critics say there is an increasing likelihood that the South Carolina project will fail to go forward and will become what a leading opponent, Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists, calls a “plant to nowhere.” That would leave the United States without a clear path for the disposal of its surplus plutonium.A cheaper alternative, encasing it in glass, was canceled in 2002 by President George W. Bush’s administration. The energy secretary at the time, Spencer Abraham, is now the non-executive chairman of the American arm of Areva, a French company that is the world’s largest mox producer and is primarily responsible for building the South Carolina plant.After the cold war, the United States and Russia were left with stockpiles of plutonium, and the fear was that one or the other would reverse course and use the plutonium to make new weapons, or that, in what the National Academies of Science called a “clear and present danger,” thieves could make off with it.Plutonium is easy to handle because the radiation it gives off is persistent but relatively weak. The type used in weapons, plutonium 239, has a half-life of 24,000 years and emits alpha rays. They make the plutonium feel warm to the touch but are so feeble that skin easily stops the radiation. If trapped inside the body, though, alpha rays can cause cancer.At the same time, plutonium is preferred over uranium as nuclear bomb fuel because much less is needed to make a blast of equal size. And while it is difficult to work with, it does not need to undergo the complex process of purification required for uranium.The 43 tons of surplus plutonium in the American stockpile could fuel up to 10,000 nuclear weapons and even more “dirty bombs” — ordinary explosives that spew radioactive debris. Alternatively, they could fuel 43 large reactors for about a year.After studying a range of options, the Clinton administration decided to build a mox fuel plant to dispose of a portion of the plutonium, awarding a contract to a consortium now called Shaw Areva Mox Services.The rest of the plutonium was to be mixed with highly radioactive nuclear waste and immobilized in glass or ceramic blocks, making it difficult and dangerous for any thief to extract. The government judged the mox route to be more expensive, but the dual-track approach was seen as insurance should either fail.That strategy also helped persuade Jim Hodges, the Democratic governor of South Carolina from 1999 to 2003, to sign off on plutonium shipments to the Savannah River Site. When the Bush administration canceled the glass-block disposal program, Mr. Hodges was furious.His concern, he said in a recent interview, was that South Carolina would become a dumping ground if the mox program did not work out because of political or technical difficulties. “That site was never designed for long-term plutonium storage,” he said. “We were concerned about health and safety.” Now, he said, that dumping ground is in danger of coming to pass.Mr. Abraham said that budget cuts had made it necessary to end one of the programs, and that with the Russians favoring mox, the administration had feared that going the other route would discourage Moscow from keeping its end of the bargain. (Only later, Mr. Abraham added, did he decide to join Areva in a largely advisory role.)“The politics of it — both from a budget standpoint and in terms of the Russian comfort level — both argued for going to the mox-only approach,” he said.If mox fuel was to be licensed for widespread use, though, Washington first needed to have it tested in reactors. Duke Energy agreed to use French-made mox. The government paid $26 million to prepare a reactor, according to the Energy Department. But a test in 2005 was aborted after the fuel began behaving strangely. Though the problem was ultimately traced to a different material in the fuel assemblies, Duke subsequently said it had no further plans to test or use the mox.Along the way, the cost of the South Carolina project, originally about $1 billion, nearly quintupled. Energy Department officials said cost increases were to be expected because the original estimates were rough approximations. The sprawling plant, which is just south of Aiken, S.C., is to be bigger in size than eight football fields, and its construction currently employs nearly 2,000 workers.For other countries, plutonium is seen as an opportunity rather than a problem. Nearly all reactors produce some plutonium as a byproduct of splitting atoms in two, and it can be gathered from spent fuel and mixed with uranium to make mox.The United States, worried that plutonium recycling would contribute to the global spread of nuclear weapons, gave it up during the Carter administration. President Obama’s panel on America’s nuclear future is considering whether to recommend a return to recycling.The Japanese government has followed the recycling path, despite citizens’ protests about possible safety risks. In the wake of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, officials at Areva, which supplied the mox fuel for Reactor No. 3 there, are cautioning against drawing hasty conclusions.“Mox was not the cause of that accident, and the consequences of it have not been impacted by mox,” said David Jones, a vice president at Areva, which has been providing on-the-ground assistance in Japan.There is no clear evidence that plutonium has been released by the mox-loaded Japanese reactor; small traces found at the site could have come from other sources or from the site’s other reactors. But Reactor No. 3 is one of three at Fukushima Daiichi that are judged to have undergone at least partial meltdowns, and experts are debating whether high radiation readings beneath the reactor vessels indicate that they have begun to leak. It would take full meltdowns, high heat and the rupture of a reactor’s containment vessel to loft substantial plutonium into the air.The dangers vary depending on the chain of events that led to the accident and the concentration of mox in the reactor core. Even so, studies show that a nuclear meltdown and containment failure in a reactor that holds mox would result in more cancer deaths than one in a reactor fueled only with uranium.In 2001, Dr. Lyman, a Cornell-trained physicist who has led the battle against mox, published a detailed study in the journal Science & Global Security that concluded the fuel could produce up to 30 percent more cancer deaths.Energy Department officials do not dispute that there would be additional health consequences, but they see them as less severe than the critics have predicted. In any event, they argue, a major release of plutonium would require an accident so severe that the additional health effects would amount to a “sliver on top of a mountaintop.”“It’s not that significant — 10 percent or less,” said Kenneth Bromberg, the department’s assistant deputy administrator for fissile materials disposition.“Proliferation causes a far greater danger to a far greater number of people than highly controlled use of this fuel in a reactor,” said Ms. Harrington, his boss.But critics say that in its efforts to move the mox program along, the government has undercut the nonproliferation benefits by allowing or entertaining exceptions to a number of its rules for safeguarding plutonium.Disposing of plutonium by burning it in reactors involves moving and then storing mox fuel at a commercial site. Such a plan, they argue, could make the fuel vulnerable to theft before it is irradiated into something that would be too deadly to steal.But at the request of Duke Energy, which had agreed to test the fuel, the government decided to exempt nuclear plants that burn mox from special security requirements imposed on other facilities that handled “strategic special nuclear material” like plutonium.In doing so, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission overruled its own Atomic Safety Licensing Board, which had recommended a middle ground requiring some additional security. But the commissioners reasoned that mox encased in heavy assemblies would not be as attractive to terrorists as pure plutonium, and so did not require the same level of security.Jeffrey Merrifield, one of the commission members who voted on the matter, now works for the Shaw Group, which is designing the mox plant with Areva. He said in a statement that he had not discussed jobs with the company until after the vote and that he works in a section unrelated to the mox project.The Shaw Areva Group requested an exception to the government’s material control and accounting standards for plutonium. Though the company subsequently withdrew the request, it led the Atomic Safety Licensing Board to rule that more hearings were needed to determine whether the Savannah River plant was capable of keeping track of the plutonium that is expected to move through it and on to commercial utilities.In a statement, Shaw Areva said, “We continue to believe that the mox project meets all the regulatory requirements for licensing, and we welcome the opportunity to present our case” in hearings this year.Ms. Harrington said security at the Savannah River Site was so tight that “I’d defy anyone to walk in and walk out with any of our plutonium.”Still, Mr. Abraham, the former energy secretary, says that given the crisis in Japan, he understands the hesitation of utilities to embrace mox.“I can’t imagine any utility would say, ‘Yeah, we are going to ignore Japan,’ ” he said. “I think the dust has to settle here.”"

Even so, the public authorities have sought to avoid grim technical details that might trigger alarm or even panic.“They don’t want to go there,” said Robert Alvarez, a nuclear expert who, from 1993 to 1999, was a policy adviser to the secretary of energy. “The spin is all about reassurance.”If events in Japan unfold as they did at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the forensic modeling could go on for some time. It took more than three years before engineers lowered a camera to visually inspect the damaged core of the Pennsylvania reactor, and another year to map the extent of the destruction. The core turned out to be about half melted. By definition, a meltdown is the severe overheating of the core of a nuclear reactor that results in either the partial or full liquefaction of its uranium fuel and supporting metal lattice, at times with the atmospheric release of deadly radiation. Partial meltdowns usually strike a core’s middle regions instead of the edge, where temperatures are typically lower.The lofting of the latter particles in large quantities points to “substantial fuel melting,” Dr. Henry said.  Take away from above.“I don’t think there’s any mystery or foul play,” Dr. Po said of the disaster’s scale. “It’s just so bad.” Sorry folks, its quite simple, there is a meltdown, the containment is broken, there is airborne radiation (which should be quite obvious to what it is) and AT LEAST 40 km zone has seen enough radioactivity to increase chances of cancer (as seen by previous studies)The Japanese Govt is waffling still and dont have the guts to come out and say as it is -- since they cant handle the fallout."

The melted fuel burned through three stories of the reactor’s basement but stopped at the foundation — where the mass remains so highly radioactive that scientists still cannot approach it.

But that depends what you  meant by ""survival"". There was partial meltdown, but then it is not the end of the world story as we all know. Japanese have done well despite all odds.Chaanakya,Sorry for a late reply to your post, was away for a few days.Your reading is wrong. The plant would have survived if the auxiliary generators had not been knocked out after the power line went. All available information shows that the cooling rods were inserted automatically once the earthquake struck and the reactors went into automatic shutdown mode, as indeed did other reactors in Japan.If the tsunami hadn't struck, it's pretty obvious that the chain reaction that occurred with the hydrogen explosions etc would most probably have not happened. Note that didn't happen in any of the plants in Japan which did not have their auxiliary power units taken out.So my original contention that the basic reactor survived despite a quake 7-8 time greater than the design tolerance limits stands. The 40-year Gen I design proved remarkably rugged. I would assume today's Gen III would be even more rugged.Presently it is at 2.5 % so I don't know what options are foregone?Yes presently it's in that range but why do you suppose that it's going to stay at that range for all times to come?Well I think in its present status it is as good as gone. That's what I meant by ""survived"". Yes it could have survived Tsunami had it been prepared for it. Clearly it wasn't. Few other plants seem to have done better.LOP and LOCA are fairly common accident conditions for which plant always need to guard against as it leads to one step away from total failure. I think , by now, enough basic material exists to indicate that TEPCO failed to do that despite being forewarned.Second point is that basic reactor is not the only component which needs to be protected. It's protection requires many other units , auxiliary systems  to function as well. So if others fails, reactor would also fail as we can see. I don't know where I presupposed that it would remain at 2.5%?"

The temblor cut off external power supply to the pumping machines for the three reactors at around 5:16 p.m. Tokyo Electric Power Co. revived the power supply and resumed water injections at 6:05 p.m., according to Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency.If the water injection is stopped for hours, coolant water would be lost again — as happened after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami — and would severely damage the hot fuel rods inside the reactors. Monday's aftershock renewed concerns over the damaged reactors, which Tepco needs to keep cooling down for months to avoid overheating of the fuel rods.The quake registered lower 6 in parts of Fukushima and Ibaraki prefectures on the Japanese seismic scale to 7, prompting workers at the Fukushima power plant to evacuate temporarily.The temblor was followed by another earthquake in the same area a minute later with a preliminary magnitude of 6.0. The second quake registered lower 5 in parts of Fukushima Prefecture.A tsunami warning was issued for Ibaraki Prefecture, which was later withdrawn.Meanwhile, according to prefectural governments and plant operators, no damage to nuclear facilities in Ibaraki, Niigata, Miyagi and Aomori prefectures was reported Monday evening."

1480,chaanakya,11 Apr 2011 16:19 ,"An article that appeared in The Hindu.Lured to work with radiationInterviews with past and current workers at Fukushima Daiichi and other plants in Japan paint a bleak picture of what happens on the nuclear circuit.UNTRAINED LABOURMr. Ishizawa, who was finally allowed to leave, is not a nuclear specialist; he is not even an employee of the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the crippled plant. He is one of thousands of untrained, itinerant, temporary labourers who handle the bulk of the dangerous work at nuclear power plants here and in other countries, lured by the higher wages offered for working with radiation. Collectively, these contractors were exposed to levels of radiation about 16 times as high as the levels faced by Tokyo Electric employees last year, according to Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, which regulates the industry. These workers remain vital to efforts to contain the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima nuclear plants.<snip>DANGEROUS FOR THEM AND SAFETY’“This is the hidden world of nuclear power,” said Yuko Fujita, a former physics professor at Keio University in Tokyo and a long-time campaigner for improved labour conditions in the nuclear industry. “Wherever there are hazardous conditions, these labourers are told to go. It is dangerous for them, and it is dangerous for nuclear safety.”In the most dangerous places, current and former workers said, radiation levels would be so high that workers would take turns approaching a valve just to open it, turning it for a few seconds before a supervisor with a stopwatch ordered the job to be handed off to the next person. Similar work would be required at the Fukushima Daiichi plant now, where the three reactors in operation at the time of the earthquake shut down automatically, workers say.“Your first priority is to avoid pan-ku,” said one current worker at the Fukushima Daini plant, using a Japanese expression based on the English word puncture. Workers use the term to describe their dosimeter, which measures radiation exposure, from reaching the daily cumulative limit of 50 millisieverts. “Once you reach the limit, there is no more work,” said the worker, who did not want to give his name for fear of being fired by his employer.Takeshi Kawakami, 64, remembers climbing into the spent-fuel pool of the No. 1 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi plant during an annual maintenance shutdown in the 1980s to scrub the walls clean of radiation with brushes and rags. All workers carried dosimeters set to sound an alarm if exposure levels hit a cumulative dose limit; Mr. Kawakami said he usually did not last 20 minutes.<snip>News of workers' mishaps turns up periodically in safety reports: one submitted by Tokyo Electric to the government of Fukushima Prefecture in October 2010 outlines an accident during which a contract worker who had been wiping down a turbine building was exposed to harmful levels of radiation after accidentally using one of the towels on his face. In response, the company said in the report that it would provide special towels for workers to wipe their sweat.SHIELDED FROM THE MEDIAMost day workers were evacuated from Fukushima Daiichi after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out the plant's power and pushed some of the reactors to the brink of a partial meltdown.Since then, those who have returned have been strictly shielded from the news media; many of them are housed at a staging ground for workers that is off limits to reporters. But there have been signs that such labourers continue to play a big role at the crippled power plant<snip>The union, he said, made 19 demands of plant operators, including urging operators not to forge radiation exposure records and not to force workers to lie to government inspectors about safety procedures. Although more than 180 workers belonged to the union at its peak, its leaders were soon visited by thugs who kicked down their doors and threatened to harm their families, he said.“They were not allowed to speak up,” Mr. Nakajima said. “Once you enter a nuclear power plant, everything's a secret.”Last week, conversations among Fukushima Daiichi workers at a smoking area at the evacuees' centre focussed on whether to stay or go back to the plant. Some said construction jobs still seemed safer, if they could be found. “You can see a hole in the ground, but you can't see radiation,” one worker said.Mr. Ishizawa, the only one who allowed his name to be used, said, “I might go back to a nuclear plant one day, but I'd have to be starving.” In addition to his jobs at Daiichi, he has worked at thermal power plants and on highway construction sites in the region. For now, he said, he will stay away from the nuclear industry.“I need a job,” he said, “but I need a safe job.”"

Coal kills more, Gas even more on a daily basis. There are no immediate clean ready large scale sources of Energy to replace Coal/ Gas/ Oil. Zilch at least for the next 20-30 years barring a major discovery by Scientists themselves. Meanwhile being 'Green' myself i'd prefer a nuclear core meltdown anyday to an Polar ice cap one (IS there anyone who would prefer the latter?). The chances of the latter happening are much brighter without NPPs than with. It's a simple take. Nuclear energy is not perfect i agree, but what better bet than that to keep our growth on, and help us get money to not only defend ourselves but also make more inroads into safer than Nuclear/ Oil/Gas/ Coal sources of Energy. Maybe we crack the Throium cycle by 2030. That may help. 20 years what chances are there we learn lessons from Japan and avoid a repeat of this problem? This plant after all is of 67 vintage. This debate is not rational if it does not consider the vintage in a sense. What are the chances say a 2000 built NPP at Fukushima weathering this impact? That would be something i could learn from, maybe others too. Would a latter day built NPP withstand this better? If so, in the larger perspective i think NPP's have a brighter future in the next 30 years. Rationally that is."

The areas include Katsurao, Namie, Iitate and part of Kawamata and Minamisoma, all in Fukushima Prefecture.Those in the area ""do not need to evacuate immediately"" but will be instructed to leave in a month, given rising concerns over long-term radiation exposure, Edano said.As for the 20- to 30-km area where residents have been told to stay indoors, Edano said it would be newly designated as an ""emergency evacuation preparation zone,"" which means residents might be asked to get out.Currently, only residents within 20-km from the crippled nuclear plant have been ordered to evacuate. Those in the 20- to 30-km area have been asked to stay indoors.The move is being made despite a pronouncement by the government that the risk of contamination from high-level radiation leaks at the plant is now much lower than it was at the start of the crisis.""The risk that the situation will worsen and that there would be new massive emissions of radioactive materials is becoming considerably lower,"" Edano said at a news conference earlier Monday.""Even if there are no new emissions of radioactive substances, radiation may come out from soil . . . and this could affect health if one stays in the affected area for a long time,"" Edano said.,After the March 11 earthquake and tsunami crippled the power station, the government directed people within 20 km to evacuate and those in the 20- to 30-km ring to stay indoors or ""voluntarily leave"" because it would be difficult to stay because of the lack of goods and services."

Japan's Nuclear Regulatory Commission is now recommending that those living in areas where the annual accumulated dose will reach 20 millisieverts over the next year move to safer areas, Masanori Shinano told reporters. Prior to the current emergency, nuclear power plant workers in Japan were limited to annual doses of 100 millisieverts. Protecting ordinary citizens is not an emergency situation but rather a ""deliberate evacuation"" that will be carried out over the next month after consultations with the affected communities, according to government spokesman Noriyuki Shikata, speaking at a press conference.The areas with elevated radiation levels are northwest of the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant and apparently got the worst of a radioactive plume blown in that direction by weather patterns in the early days of the crisis.Towns south of the plant seem to be much safer. Radiation levels throughout the entire region have dropped significantly over the past month. But the downward curve has been flattening out, indicating that iodine, with a half-life of 8 days, is decaying but that cesium-134 and cesium-137 ""account for the majority of radiation you can measure today; that is very bad news,"" said Greenpeace radiation expert Jan Vande Putte at a briefing today. The half-life of cesium-134 is 2 years; that of cesium-137 is 30 years. This means dangerous levels of radiation could persist for years if not decades.Government officials could not immediately say how many people will need to move under the new evacuation policy or how long they will need to stay away from their homes. ""There has to be more intensive monitoring to answer such questions,"" Shinano said. In a related development, the Ministry of Agriculture on Friday banned the planting of rice in soil found to contain more than 5000 becquerels per kilogram of cesium. Several of the handful of locations sampled by Greenpeace exceed those limits, said Rianne Teule, another Greenpeace radiation expert. The agricultural ministry said that it will take more extensive test to determine which fields are off limits. The ministry also intends to boost testing of harvested rice. Fukushima set for epic clean-up: Latest data suggest a Chernobyl-like effort will be needed.http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110411/full/472146a.htmlAs the immediate threat from Fukushima Daiichi's damaged nuclear reactors recedes, engineers and scientists are facing up to a clean-up process that could last for many decades, or even a century.Experts on previous nuclear accidents say that the sheer quantity of nuclear material that needs to be removed from the site, together with the extent of the damage, makes Fukushima a unique challenge. The plant is home to just under 1,000 tonnes of nuclear fuel and thousands of tonnes of radioactive water.Last week, the Toshiba Corporation floated a rough proposal to clean up the site in a decade, according to Japanese media. But veterans of clean-up operations at sites such as Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania say that it will probably take much longer. The removal of the radioactive material will require a carefully planned and technologically sophisticated programme, made all the more challenging by the devastation left after partial core meltdowns and explosions.No clean-up can begin until the reactors are stabilized. Radiation around the plant is beginning to wane, but the threat of further releases has not yet passed. On 7 and 11 April, severe aftershocks struck nearby, raising fears that the three crippled reactors could be damaged further. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which manages the plant, says that no additional damage has been detected.A 26 March report from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), leaked to The New York Times, says that massive explosions at the plant in March scattered fuel from the reactors' spent-fuel pools around the site. NRC officials also believe that a portion of the uranium fuel inside the unit 2 reactor may have escaped its stainless steel containment vessel and fallen onto the concrete floor below, although the Japanese government has yet to confirm this. In addition, the document indicates that water is not circulating properly through the cores of the damaged reactors, so it will be necessary to continue to flood them, says Richard Lahey, an emeritus professor of nuclear engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.This strategy creates its own problems. The reactors' cooling systems are normally a closed circuit. Flooding the cores means that water contaminated with radioisotopes will continue to spill out into the environment. TEPCO has already reported highly radioactive water in buildings and trenches around the site.Dealing with the water will be a pressing priority for any clean-up operation, according to Jack DeVine, an independent nuclear consultant who spent six years dismantling the unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island after it partially melted down in 1979. The accident left thousands of tonnes of water laced with radioactive caesium-137 swilling around in the reactor's basement. Over the course of months, the US team built a system that could suck the water out and pass it through radiation-resistant zeolite filters. The zeolite removed the caesium and other radioisotopes, leaving almost pristine water, which was eventually evaporated at a facility on the site. A similar system could work at Fukushima, says DeVine, although the constant leakage from the damaged cores means that any clean-up is a race against time. More than 10,000 tonnes of low-level radioactive water has already had to be dumped from storage tanks into the Pacific Ocean to make way for more-radioactive cooling water.Cleaning up the reactors themselves presents an even greater challenge. Debris and high radiation levels are making it impossible to conduct proper surveys of the damage. In the near term, robots will need to explore the reactor buildings and map the radiation inside, says Red Whittaker, a robotics expert at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who has developed systems for other nuclear accidents.It could be years before anyone can look inside the cores themselves. At Three Mile Island, engineers had to wait three years before radiation levels had fallen sufficiently to allow them to lower a camera through a control rod drive shaft into the heart of the reactor. At Fukushima, it could take longer still. The boiling water reactor (BWR) design used there is sealed with a solid stainless-steel cap that can only be removed by a heavy, fuel-loading crane located above the reactor. Explosions at three of the units with fuel in their cores mean that ""their cranes are clearly toast"", says DeVine. Plant operators will have to find another way in.The reactor's design also presents other problems. ""The BWR is just a rat's nest of tight spaces, pipes and valves,"" says DeVine. To effectively remove the fuel, DeVine thinks that one or more new buildings with dedicated cranes must be built around each reactor. ""It's not something that will be up in a month or two,"" he says. Whittaker adds that robots and humans will need to share the work in a methodical, coordinated way. ""The nature of these operations is that they are patient and persistent,"" he says.Indeed, the effort required seems likely to be more akin to the clean-up strategy at Chernobyl in the Ukraine than that of Three Mile Island. Engineers at Chernobyl are beginning to lay the foundations for a massive €1-billion (US$1.4-billion) enclosure, complete with automated cranes, that will eventually lift apart the sarcophagus of steel and concrete hastily thrown up around the stricken unit 4 reactor in the months after it exploded in 1986. The new building, which is intended to last a century, was agreed in principle in 2001, but will not be completed until at least 2015. Clean-up of the site is scheduled to last until 2065 — almost 80 years after the accident.TEPCO almost certainly cannot afford a clean-up on this scale. ""I think that, ultimately, the government is going to have to pay for it,"" says Robert Alvarez at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington DC, who oversaw clean-up of former US nuclear weapons plants during the administration of President Bill Clinton. The government already seems to be mulling whether to take over the utility, shares in which have plunged since the accident.Given the complexity of the task ahead, some think it may be better to abandon Fukushima entirely — at least for the time being. ""My bet would be: you seal it and wait a hundred years,"" says Alan Johnson, a retired reactor physicist who was head of Britain's Sella­field nuclear processing site in the late 1980s.Sellafield, once known as Windscale, was in 1957 the site of the United Kingdom's worst nuclear accident, when a reactor's graphite core caught fire. Final decommissioning of the reactor is still at least 20 years away, but the hiatus has allowed radioactive materials to decay and given engineers time to develop the best clean-up strategies possible. ""What's the rush in doing it quicker?"" asks Johnson.But natural disasters are rare in England. Given the threat of major earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons that could strike Japan in the decades to come, DeVine has his doubts about applying the same strategy. ""Bottling it up and leaving it seems to me to be a really bad choice,"" he says.  "

This, however, was made far worse in terms of health impact by the instantaneous nature of the release, the failure of authorities in the Soviet Union to evacuate nearby people and restrict the consumption of milk and finally by some people's refusal to take potassium iodide tablets due to mistrust of the government. By comparison at Fukushima the situation developed over a number of days giving Japanese authorities ample time to evacuate residents living within 20 kilometres and warn those in a further ten kilometre radius to stay indoors. Milk, drinking water and many other foodstuffs have been routinely monitored and their consumption controlled. Potassium iodide tablets were distributed early and consumed at the right time.So far, three workers have been killed by the immediate effects of the earthquake and tsunami and none by the effects of radiation. No measurable effect on the general public is expected.http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS_Fu ... 04111.htmlThe INES scale is a relative scale. It just says 7 is a 'major accident'. One of the first thing that the INES user manual (2008) says is that INES must not be used to compare with other nuclear accidents in other countries because the contexts are different.

It says the damaged facilities have been releasing a massive amount of radioactive substances, which are posing a threat to human health and the environment over a wide area.The agency used the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, or INES, to gauge the level. The scale was designed by an international group of experts to indicate the significance of nuclear events with ratings of 0 to 7.On March 18th, one week after the massive quake, the agency declared the Fukushima trouble a level 5 incident, the same as the accident at Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979.Level 7 has formerly only been applied to the Chernobyl accident in the former Soviet Union in 1986 when hundreds of thousands of terabecquerels of radioactive iodine-131 were released into the air. One terabecquerel is one trillion becquerels.The agency believes the cumulative amount from the Fukushima plant is less than that from Chernobyl.Officials from the agency and the Nuclear Safety Commission will hold a news conference on Tuesday morning to explain the change of evaluation.Tuesday, April 12, 2011 05:47 +0900 (JST)http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201104110139.htmlMost of Iitate and Kawamata are outside the 30-kilometer radius.Speaking about the new evacuation zone, Fukuyama said on a Fuji Television Network Inc. program on Sunday that Prime Minister Naoto Kan has told government officials to put the safety of residents above anything else.The amounts of accumulated radiation have been rising in northern Fukushima Prefecture and other places due to the wind direction./speculation/Apparently not enough data is being released.

There are many tales emerging of the unselfishness and bravery of these workers, while others take a more realistic view of why they are risking their lives amid high radiation levels to cool down the plant's overheating fuel rods.A man in his 40s, who was dispatched to Fukushima No. 1 from a partner of the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), said, ""I did not want to go there. But if I reject the request, I will lose my job.""The daily pay is less than 20,000 yen ($236).What workers found at Fukushima No. 1 in the beginning was a lack of adequate safety equipment and spartan living conditions.At the start of the nuclear crisis, there was an insufficient number of dosimeters to measure radiation levels. Because of that, about 180 workers were engaged in the recovery work without them.An employee of a company that has dispatched its workers to the Fukushima plant added, ""We want to make the dispatched workers wear lead-lined suits.""The Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant had ""whole body counters,"" which measures ""internal exposure,"" or level of radiation in the human body. However, those counters were rendered useless due to damage from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The internal exposure is now measured by inspection vehicles.Despite the precautions for worker safety at Fukushima No. 1, there is concern.""Some workers may have radiation-caused symptoms after several years,"" said Atsushi Suzuki, a lawyer who previously handled a labor disaster compensation issue for a nuclear power plant worker.Suzuki represented a man who worked at the Fukushima No. 1 plant from 1977 to 1982 as a plumber and on other jobs.After he left the workplace, he was diagnosed as suffering from multiple myeloma, a deadly bone marrow cancer. He died in 2007.The man was recognized to have died from exposure to radiation. In a suit seeking compensation, however, TEPCO did not acknowledge its responsibility. As a result, his demand for compensation was rejected.""It is extremely difficult to prove scientifically the cause-and-effect-relationship between exposure to radiation and a disease that broke out later,"" Suzuki said. ""I think that people currently engaged in recovery work (at the Fukushima No. 1 plant) do not have the leeway to prevent exposure to radiation by themselves. It is necessary for the government and TEPCO to fully consider sufficient prevention measures and compensation (to those who suffered radiation-caused diseases)."""

1536,chaanakya,12 Apr 2011 11:45 ,"TEPCO tardy on N-plant emergencyThe Yomiuri ShimbunPrime Minister Naoto Kan's blood must have run cold around 10 p.m. on March 11, the day of the Great East Japan Earthquake, when he received the first report on the terrible situation at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.The report from the Nuclear and Industry Safety Agency of the Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry predicted reactor cores at the nuclear power plant--where power and all functions to cool the reactors were lost in the quake and tsunami--would be exposed to air, and that extreme heat generated by fuel rods would damage their encasing tubes later that night.Fuel rods would melt down, and the following morning the pressure inside the reactors' containment vessels would reach the maximum allowed for by the facilities' designers, the report predicted.Kan and everyone at the Prime Minister's Office understood the seriousness of the situation described by the report.There were only two options that might prevent a meltdown of the reactors--either restore the plant's power supply and cooling functions immediately, or pour water directly into the reactors. If neither course of action could be taken, the pressure inside the reactors would become so great that they would be destroyed.The report concluded that valves in the containment vessels would have to be opened, to release radioactive steam and reduce the pressure inside.However, opening the valves was considered a last resort. Although it could prevent the reactors from breaking apart, it would release steam with high levels of radioactive materials into the atmosphere.Such a step had never been taken at a nuclear power plant in Japan.===Countdown to power lossThe Prime Minister's Office, the nuclear safety agency and even Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of the Fukushima plant, were filled with relief immediately after the earthquake. They had been told backup diesel generators would provide sufficient support to stabilize the Nos. 1 to 3 reactors, which were in operation when the quake hit.However, subsequent tsunami destroyed 12 of the 13 emergency generators.""Round up all the power-supply cars and send them to the plant right now!"" shouted a TEPCO supervisor at the utility's head office in Tokyo.Nuclear reactors have emergency cooling systems that channel water into the reactor, using a turbine that can be powered by residual heat. However, the systems rely on emergency batteries to power the water intake valves.The emergency batteries at the Fukushima plant were expected to run out of power around midnight.===Options exhaustedTEPCO dispatched power-supply vehicles from various power stations around the country to the crippled nuclear plant. However, the vehicles had to travel very slowly because of damage to roads in northeastern Japan. The first power-supply car did not reach the plant until 9 p.m. on March 11.Once at the site, the lack of preparation became apparent. Cables needed to connect the vehicles' high-voltage electricity to plant facilities were not long enough. TEPCO immediately ordered additional cables, but precious time had been wasted. Power would not be restored at the plant by midnight.The pressure inside the containment vessels rose above the maximum allowed for by the facilities' design, and radiation levels at the plant increased sharply. No option was left but to open the valves.===Anger rose as TEPCO ditheredTEPCO began preparations for opening the valves around 7 p.m. on March 11. Pressure inside the No. 1 reactor was particularly high.""Soon, the reactor won't be able to withstand the pressure,"" said an official of the accident headquarters at the plant, which was keeping in touch with TEPCO's head office via video phone. ""We have to vent the pressure immediately.""""Pressure inside the containment vessel of the No. 1 reactor has gone up dramatically,"" the agency told Banri Kaieda, economy, trade and industry minister, at 12:45 a.m. on March 12. In fact, it had reached 1.5 times the designed maximum, meaning the condition of the reactor was critical.""To get things under control, we have to pour water into the reactors and then vent the steam that is generated,"" Haruki Madarame, chairman of the Cabinet Office's Nuclear Safety Commission, told Kaieda.At 1:30 a.m. on March 12, Kan, Kaieda and Madarame gathered at the crisis management center in the basement of the Prime Minister's Office.The three urged TEPCO officials to vent the steam as soon as possible. But TEPCO officials said there was no way of opening the valves because there was no power supply.Exasperated, Kaieda called the utility's head office in Tokyo and the accident headquarters at the plant every hour, pressuring them to open the valves immediately.TEPCO workers tried to open the valves by manually overriding the automatic system, but struggled to make progress because they had to work in darkness.At dawn, pressure inside the No. 1 reactor was more than twice the designed maximum.Eventually, at 6:50 a.m., the government ordered the utility to open the valves under the Nuclear Reactor Regulation Law.When Kan visited the accident site shortly after 7 a.m. and found TEPCO had not opened the valves yet, he reprimanded company officials. The officials replied they would like to have another hour to make a decision on what to do.Kan blew his stack.""Now's not the time to make such lackadaisical comments!"" the prime minister told the TEPCO officials.Yet even still, the utility spent three more hours discussing the matter before finally opening the valves at 10:17 a.m.Five hours after that, a hydrogen explosion occurred at the No. 1 reactor, blowing apart its outer building.(Apr. 12, 2011)"

""The INES rating itself is not an indicator of a daily phenomena, but the assessment after careful consideration and calculation on the event that happened in the past,"" Ken Morita of NISA told TIME on Tuesday morning. NISA has also noted, however, that the amount of radioactive material being released at Fukushima today is less than 1 terabecquerel. The agency says that, to date, Fukushima has only released about 10% of total radiation released 25 years ago in Chernobyl, or about 1.8 million terabecquerels. About 30 people, mostly workers, died in the immediate aftermath of Chernobyl, though the UN has estimated that the long-term death toll due to exposure could eventually be as high as 4000. It's worth remembering that all the radiation released in Chernobyl happened over a few days. At Fukushima, we've just crossed a month and it's still at 10 per cent. It's no wonder 30 people died in Chernobyl but no fatalities have been reported yet from Fukushima, in fact no radiation sickness also.Though raising Fukushima's level to 7 may not herald any immediate worsening of events, it is sure to add to many residents' growing concern — and feelings of helplessness — over what could happen at dozens of other nuclear reactors spread across this seismic archipelago.You know, earlier some of the Green warriors here - one in particular - was accusing Japan of cover-up, subterfuge and what not. Well now it seems that the Japanese are too transparent for their own good. That's because the frankness and hyper precautionary position results in gems like this:Sanku wrote:Shouldn't Japan be placed under sanctions as a irresponsible Nuclear power considering how they have been dumping radioactivity in environment?"

1546,chaanakya,12 Apr 2011 13:04 ,"Offshore windmills weather crisisExpansion eyed for plant off Ibaraki running at full capacityBy MINORU MATSUTANIStaff writerA cheap and simply structured wind-power plant proved more resistant to natural disasters than nuclear plants.The wind plant 50 meters off the coast of Kamisu, Ibaraki Prefecture, survived the massive March 11 tsunami and is now running at full capacity supplying electricity to Tokyo Electric Power Co., which was greatly compromised when the waves crippled the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant.The wind plant owned and operated by Fukui Prefecture-based Mitani Corp., one of Japan's two offshore wind-power plants, has seven power generators. Each generator is attached to three propeller blades sitting atop a mast that, when turning, transforms wind into electricity.""All the windmills and transformer stations were safe. Our facilities proved resistant to tsunami,"" Mitani Managing Director Yoshitaka Yamamoto said.Each mast, sunk into the seabed at a depth of 25 meters, stands roughly 70 meters above the water. The March 11 tsunami reached 5 meters, Yamamoto said. Each transformer is located on a jetty dozens of meters away from the masts and is enclosed in fiber-reinforced plastic measuring 8.3 meters x 4.3 meters and 4 meters high, he said.The machine stayed dry amid the tsunami because the jetty, connected to a coastal road, is 9.6 meters above sea level and the walls and ceiling kept water from splashing onto the machine, he said.Although clean and relatively cheap, wind power plant output is far below total electricity demand.Mitani's wind plants generate 2,000 kw each, thus the company's total output is just 14,000 kw. That is about 0.04 percent of Tepco's current capacity after the largest utility's Fukushima No. 1 and 2 nuclear plants shut down.Desperate to avoid blackouts, Tepco has asked Mitani Corp. to run its plant at full capacity, Yamamoto said.Besides Mitani's, the Setana Municipal Government has a facility off the coast of Setana, Hokkaido Prefecture, with two wind-power generators. However, each generator's capacity is only 600 kw.Wind power accounted for less than 1 percent of Japan's entire electricity supply in 2007, whereas coal accounted for 27.7 percent, natural gas for 25.8 percent, nuclear energy for 23.5 percent, oil for 13.9 percent and hydraulic power for 6.6 percent, according to Tepco and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, or NEDO.Profitability may be a problem with wind power plants. Yamamoto said his company's plant's profit is ""not so big.""""The plant does not need strong wind. Normal wind lets the plant produce the maximum 2,000 kw,"" he said.The government is expected to support promotion of wind power generation at sea as it aims to increase such capacity to an ambitious 10 million kw, equivalent to 10 nuclear reactors, by 2020 from 2.19 million kw in the fiscal 2009, as was stipulated in the strategy on marine renewable energy last May.Japan had 1,683 inland wind power generators in fiscal 2009, according to NEDO. But residents generally don't welcome them because of noise and sonic waves that can make people feel ill.Mitani is planning to add eight more generators to the seven already at the windmill offshore farm, Yamamoto said, hoping the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear crisis will boost the public support for the clean energy.A wind generator system costs about ¥600 million, Yamamoto said. That compares with hundreds of billions yen for a cutting-edge nuclear reactor. ""Still, profitability of nuclear plants is much higher, assuming there is no crisis like the ongoing one with the Fukushima No. 1 plant,"" he said.."

A minor flaw but why should that stop anyone from designing mega power plants based on 80C water. The Pharmoola is actually  Q = mc Delta(T) . That is bhery bhery important. See, I dropped hints all along for Chanakyaa ji including Clausius's statement on the doosra Kanoon, including how you cant extract work by cooling it cooler than the surroundings! But he thinks it is ""keraap"" what to do sir ji. In Yin Jin Ear Ring , sensible heat is to the amount of heat you can realistically extract. Sure, if you have a sink at 0 deg K, you an extract some 40000000000000 joules of heat, but unfortunately, the sink is usually at ambient temperature, so in desh that means something like 25c to 40c ,even 50c in places!. So , plugging into the Pharmoola, the sensible heat you can extract, if your source is 80C , is around  c*30 to c*55 for unit mass , which is a far cry from c*(80 + 273) = c* 353 ! Ya Allah!  That is close to just a 6th to a 10th or worse of what you can theoretically extract !       . And so Thermodynamics Murdabad! We want 100% extraction onree.     YinJinEars are Useless. What a waste I tell ya!So yeah, if you wait until the cows come home, with 80c source, you can heat water to 80C, or use the energy from to boil a very small quantity of water so that the working fluid has enough thermal potential to drive a very very tinku sa turbine , that will rival the power output of a hamster in a wheel!   All the (dj)inn-ji-niyars have been wasting time converting water to steam. Should have contacted a (dj)inn-see-niyar.Indeed. Even waste heat recovery systems are usually run on the exhaust side which has usually flue/ outlet gases at pretty high temperatures if you want to do stuff like running turbines.Stuff like water at 80C is usually used to just heat up the feed water before it gets into the boiler  via a heat exchanger and passes out at something close to ambient. That kind of process heat (low temps , less than boiling ) is all it can be used for. Another problem with the proposal of using decay heat from the pool to drive a critical system like emergency pumps etc is this. The decay heat is an exponential decay. The heat value goes down faster than a Paki skiing downhill at Kargil! So , what will you size the boilers and stuff for. After all, unlike in a coal powered railway engine, where you replenish the fuel when it burns, no one is going to be shoveling in fresh spent fuel at the exponential rate at which it decays.That is why I asked Chaanakya to do some bit of thinking on ""Sensible Heat"" and come back if it made any ""Sense"" (pun intended). But unfortunately, it became ""keraap"" and ""uncivil"" language. Yawn.. Such is life. But you gotta hand it. I am really proud of that rip off from that Voltas Ad. Actually that Voltas Ad is spot on. HVAC engineers know their sensible heats. It is their bread and butter and that Ad was definitely signed off by a Nerd who knew what the efficiency issues were about."

In general, your comments about utilization of exhaust heat are very important. Every technology wastes heat.  I have seen plans to utilize the waste heat from the AHWR to de-salienate seawater.  Waste heat from coal plants can be used to steam coals into gas (clean coal) and re-burn it -- by some accunts it raises thermal efficiency from ~33% to ~50%. Ityadi, ityadi.

The battery backup at Fukushima NPP, (from what I have been told by people who ought to know) was primary for  managing valves in the cooling system, significant amount of energy (till the diesel generators kicked in) was from the steam (from decay heat etc). Power requirement for cooling is not a trivial matter (see  Ramana's post.. or size of those diesel generators.).2. The above is because the pumps in the cooling systems run on AC current, which generators produce directly but it still an engineering challenge to get it from batteries (in that high power rate - remember these are decades old designs)3. The things  failed (details still to be investigated) and  the pumping system/cooling system did not work (even when power was restored).4. In Chernobyl the main cause of all that going wrong was, ironically, a silly test to test how that kind of cooling system will work (roughly speaking)5. The decay heat is neither exponential or  steady-state, it is quite complicated.. not only depends on type of fuel, reactor type but mainly how long the reactor was running before shutdown.A approximate formula people use is something like  k((T-T')^-(0.2) -T^(-.2)) where T' is  the time the reactor was running before shutdown. (k = something like 0.07 for Fukushima)  (Formula is approximate)MITNSE site had a nice graph for Fukushima decay heat  (Their values and formula is little different than mine given above)I have given values per ton in some of my previous posts after 1 yr and 10 Yr. With regard to I-131 and other radioactive stuff spewed in air:1. The values are out in open source  or one can ask and get the number (No one is hiding it, I don't think any one can hide it)2.  Even values obtained in Ohio (see my previous post) one can estimate and will get order of magnitude correct. One need not insinuate that people like me, scientists, and Tepco officials all are lying.3. Values are indeed very high (specially Xe which turns into I-129), I-131 etc which spewed out   Not so bad news about above is:  - Unlike Chernobyl (land locked) lot of it went over ocean.   - Radiation is very closely monitored. Evacuation,  and no eating of I-131 laced food etc...People are listening to  scientists vs MCQ's   - The number of deaths due to radiation etc are still nil ( Remember, we have a major earth-quake / tsunami which has killed thousands)   - Scare mongers are being exposed and are not having too much effect on Japan's people.

1565,Amber G.,12 Apr 2011 22:21 ,"Today the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency revised its INES rating of the Fukushima Daiichi event. The previous assessment treated the events at each of the ailing reactors as separate: the core damage to units 1-3 resulted in an assignment of a 5 (accident with wider consequences) for each reactor; the problems at unit 4′s spent fuel pool were assigned a 3 (serious incident). NISA is now treating the situation as a single event, assigned a rating of 7 (major accident). This rating is still being assessed as information about the disposition of radioactive materials originating at the reactor site comes in.Because the rating is now the same as that assigned to the Chernobyl accident, the blog has received a number of questions about how the events at Fukushima differ from it. We present a sequence of events at Chernobyl, along with links to some denser technical matter for interested readers, and an IAEA report on the human costs of the disaster. For comparison, it’s been estimated that the radiation released by the Fukushima reactors is 1/10th that released to the environment at Chernobyl.ChernobylOn April 26th 1986, the most serious nuclear accident in history took place at Unit 4 of the Chernobyl power plant located 130 km north of Kiev, Ukraine.  The site had four RBMK-1000 reactors.  These reactors are graphite moderated boiling water reactors and did not have a containment structure. Reactor containment is the large and thick concrete and metal structure surrounding the nuclear reactor. Its purpose is to protect the reactor from external damage, and to contain radioactivity in case of a significant reactor failure. By regulation, all western BWR and PWR reactors have to have a containment.  Additionally, the RBMK design also had a very large and positive coolant void reactivity coefficient, meaning that as the coolant (i.e. water) temperature increases, the reactor power increases. This positive coefficient is not present in BWRs or PWRs.A brief summary of the events is presented here, a detailed description can be found at http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/chernobyl/inf07.html.    The following document (http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Bookle ... rnobyl.pdf) also includes information about the health and environmental effects of Chernobyl accident.On April 25th, unit 4 was to shut down for routine maintenance, prior to which a safety test was to be performed.  The test was to evaluate how long the turbine would spin and supply power to the main water pumps in the event of a loss of electrical power.  This test had been tried in the past and new adjustments were made to allow the pumps to be powered longer.After a few delays due to demand for electricity from the grid, the test was performed by an inexperienced crew.  The test was to be performed at ~30% of full power.  A series of operator actions, including the disabling of automatic shutdown mechanisms, positioned the reactor in a very unstable condition, in which the reactor was at very low power. As operators withdrew control rods in an attempt to increase the power to the level necessary for the test, the reactor heated up. The reactor’s positive void reactivity coefficient resulted in a rapid increase in power.  Control rods were inserted in order to staunch this increase in power. The unusual design of these control rods, which had graphite “followers” (recall that graphite is a moderator) worsened the situation by increasing power at an even more rapid rate. The result was a power excursion of between 100 and 500 times full power as the rods were inserted into the reactor.This large power surge caused the fuel to disintegrate.   As the fragmented fuel interacted with the steam/water mixture, a steam explosion occurred. This blew off the reactor’s massive vessel top (1000 tons) which penetrated the reactor building concrete, and dispersed burning graphite and fuel.   This initial explosion and the subsequent fire sent a plume of radioactive gas and particulates into the environment. Further explosions were caused by production of hydrogen in clad/steam chemical reaction.The radiological consequences of the Chernobyl incident were severe. The radioactive plume that emanated from the reactor contained not only volatile radioactive nuclides (such as Iodine-131, Cesium-137) which have been observed around Fukushima, but also many non-volatile ones, which were in the disintegrated fuel pieces. This plume got carried far away by wind and deposited radioactive particulates over many places in the northern hemisphere. 31 of the plant operators and firefighters got lethal radiation doses. The risk of cancer to surviving staff members and to residents of the 30 km evacuation zone is predicted to have approximately doubled as a result of exposure. An important thing to note about the Chernobyl accident is that the evacuation was not started until a nuclear reactor in Sweden (1000 km away) detected elevated radiation levels.About 97% of the radioactive nuclides found in spent or partially spent fuel remain inside the fuel rods, as long as they do not melt. Of those, a fraction are noble gases (such as Xe-135), and many are solid materials. When the fuel melts, the noble gases escape the fuel and leak to the environment; however, due to being noble gases they do not react chemically, and disperse in the atmosphere. Iodine-131 (deposits in thyroid), Cesium-137 (30-year half-life) and Strontium-90 (replaces calcium in bones) are the three most significant non-gaseous fission products. Due to the explosion of the reactor vessel in the Chernobyl accident, these products were released as well, thus significantly contributing to the dose to the public.Chernobyl unit 4 is now enclosed in a large concrete shelter which was erected quickly (by October 1986) to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant.  The last reactor, unit 3, was shut down in 2000.  A New Safe Confinement structure is due to be completed in 2014. It is being built adjacent to the facility and then will be moved into place on rails.Source:http:[url]//mitnse.com/2011/04/12/new-provisional-ines-rating-a-chernobyl-primer/[/url]"

1582,Mort Walker,13 Apr 2011 01:03 ,"Theo,Remember batteries are used through the UPS system that powers 3-phase motor equipment.  3-phase AC power is sent through the UPS and when it detects main power loss, it switches to batteries in milli-seconds.  A data center needs DC power, or at least DC-AC-DC, so the problem is different.  AC motors, especially for pumps & valves, have an in-rush of current when first started, then settle down.  They are also subject to phase changes or a loss of a phase and then don't work right.  As AmberG said, you need powerful pumps to sink that much heat, and without it at Fukushima the batteries back up through the UPS system provided 8 hours.  Consider that these pumps probably require 208V 3-phase motors that need a lot of continuous current.The link you provided at the bottom shows which UPS systems they have.  I can assure you, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Eaton-Power Ware and some Indian companies make excellent high capacity, > 1000 KVA, 3-phase UPS systems.

1588,Theo_Fidel,13 Apr 2011 01:45 ,The batteries don't have to & don't power the entire building. Even emergency lighting is on its own battery pack. AFAIK the batteries definitely operate the essential pumps that's why I said we have to see if they were able to do so when the report comes out.Take a look at page 10 of the Areva presentation. The only pump needed is the one to supply water for the heat exchanger/wet well cooling. Everything else is more or less self driven by valves. It is the dying of the condenser/wet well pump when the batteries died that caused the problems. Essentially one pump. The last line of defense. IIRC the amount of water needed for the condenser was about 200 tonnes per day. A bucket brigade could handle that. The wet well does not need even that.The odd thing is if this were a sodium coolant reactor it is not pressurized and is easily passively cooled.

The K-19 (hull number 901) was the lead ship of the Project 958 (Hotel I) class, launched 8 April 1959 and commissioned 12 November 1960; it carried three R-13 SLBMs. On 4 July 1961 a leak developed at an inaccessible part of the primary cooling circuit, causing a sudden pressure drop and triggering emergency systems. The crew improvised a system to supply coolant, involving prolonged exposure to radioactive steam and other gases in the reactor compartment. Eight crew members sustained doses of 5,000 to 6,000 rem; the rest of the crew sustained significant doses as well (at least 100 rem). A diesel submarine evacuated the crew, and the K-19 was towed back to the Kola Peninsula. For the eight crewmembers with fatal doses, time from exposure to death in days was 6, 6, 6, 8, 9, 11, 16, and 19. The remaining crew were hospitalized with radiation sickness until September. Replacement of the reactor compartment was completed from 1962 to 1964, and the two damaged reactors were dumped in Abrosimova Bay in the Kara Sea. Consequences: 8 fatalities, at least 31 injuries. "

The banana equivalent dose is the radiation exposure received by eating a single banana. Radiation leaks from nuclear plants are often measured in extraordinarily small units  By comparing the exposure from these events to a banana equivalent dose, a more intuitive assessment of the actual risk can sometimes be obtained.The average radiologic profile of bananas is 3520 picocuries per kg, or roughly 520 picocuries per 150g banana. The equivalent dose for  eating 1 banana is 0.1 muSV.

The new rating is the highest on the scale, and puts Fukushima on a par with the worst nuclear accident in history—Chernobyl. Understandably, the press has made quite a big deal out of new rating, but the reality is that Fukushima is a very different accident than Chernobyl.The maps on the right do show a passing similarity between the two accidents. The top one shows overflight measurements of radiation in the region around Fukushima. The bottom one shows Caesium-137 measurements from Chernobyl. The data are not completely analogous, but I think the maps give a sense of how both accidents have contaminated large areas and created regional hotspots that will require additional evacuations.But there are very important differences between Fukushima and Chernobyl. The biggest, in my mind at least, is the timescale over which the accident occurred. When Chernobyl's reactor number 4 exploded in 1986, it scattered debris over a wide area and sent radioactive fallout high into the atmosphere. Entire villages near the reactor had to be evacuated in a matter of hours, and many residents had to leave personal effects behind. A fire burned at the site until 5 May, spewing tones of radioactive material over 200,000 square kilometres. By November, workers had successfully completed a concrete sarcophagus around the core, effectively sealing it off. In the short period following the explosion, the accident spewed some 14 million terabecquerels of radiation into the environment.The Fukushima accident has unfolded much more slowly. The damaged reactors exploded over a period of days, and after a modest initial release, radiation has fallen off. So far, the reactors have spread about half-a-million terabecquerels into the air. I haven't been able to find hard data on the first month after Chernobyl, but I'm willing to bet my lunch that it put out a lot more in that period.The problem is that Fukushima's slow bleed of radiation is going to continue for a good period of time to come. Reactors are normally kept cool by recirculated water, but at Fukushima, the circulation system has been heavily damaged, and the only solution is to simply dump tons of water onto the cores. The water absorbs radioactive isotopes like caesium-137, and itself becomes a big waste problem. Moreover pictures from as recently as 10 April show steam continuing to rise from the reactors.This seepage in the form of water, dust and steam is creating slow-motion Chernobyl at Fukushima Daiichi. Yesterday the government announced evacuations from several villages outside the current exclusion zone. Unlike the dramatic evacuations from the Chernobyl reactors, these will take place slowly over a matter of a month or so. That's because radiation levels in the region are low enough to be safe in the near term, but not in the long-term. As ground-contamination data continues to be collected, I suspect we'll see more localized evacuations over the coming weeks and possibly even months.Time is important, especially in nuclear accidents. Fukushima's slower burn makes it easier for officials to respond to radiation risks and protect the population from contaminated food, water and air. Yet the slow release of radiation into the environment could still have great long-term economic and environmental consequences. As we've just written, the clean-up of Fukushima will probably resemble Chernobyl in many ways, and could take longer. Radiation release will hit marine life: Researchers call for extensive surveys to gauge ecological effects of Fukushima.http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110412/full/472145a.htmlAs radioisotopes pour into the sea from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, one reassuring message has been heard over and over again: the Pacific Ocean is a big place.That the isotopes will be vastly diluted is not in question. Nevertheless, scientists are calling for a marine survey to begin as soon as possible to assess any damage to ecosystems in the area around Fukushima. Although the contamination is unlikely to cause immediate harm to marine organisms, long-lived isotopes are expected to accumulate in the food chain and may cause problems such as increased mortality in fish and marine-mammal populations.""Just because you can measure it, doesn't mean it's dangerous,"" says Ken Buesseler, a marine geochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. ""Even so, this is the biggest man-made release ever of radioactive material into the oceans. We haven't yet seen enough data to assess what's going on, so anything that can be done in terms of further monitoring would be very welcome.""The past two weeks have seen extremely high concentrations of radioactive iodine-131 (with a half life of 8 days) and caesium-137 (which has a half life of 30 years) in samples of sea water collected near the Fukushima reactors, and even as far as 30 kilometres offshore. By late March, levels were tens of thousands of times higher than before the accident (see 'Radioisotope contamination'). Many other radioisotopes, both long- and short-lived, are also likely to have been released.But the total amount of radioactivity that has entered the ocean is unknown, and discharges — both accidental and deliberate — are continuing and may even be substantial if any further problems occur at the Fukushima plant (see page 146).Despite these uncertainties, scientists at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Chiba, Japan, are designing studies aimed at monitoring the accumulation of radionuclides in the muscles, organs, eggs and bones of marine organisms. They also plan to model the long-term behaviour of radioisotopes in the marine environment, and the overall radiation doses to which marine organisms will be exposed. ""We need to obtain specific concentrations of caesium and iodine isotopes to assess their effects in different marine organisms,"" says Tatsuo Aono, an expert in marine radioecology at the NIRS. A team led by Dominique Boust, director of the French Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) in Cherbourg, is now predicting the level of contamination in marine organisms and sediments using estimates of the quantity of radioisotopes released from Fukushima, and the ratios of those isotopes calculated from available seawater measurements.The team calculates that about 50 radio­isotopes contribute to an overall concentration of roughly 10,000 becquerels per litre in the sea water within 300 metres of Fukushima. Before the accident, caesium-137 concentrations there were about 0.003 becquerels per litre, and iodine-131 was not detectable. On the basis of these figures, the IRSN researchers suggest that sediments in the region could now contain 10,000–10 million becquerels per kilogram; fish could carry 10,000–100,000 becquerels per kilogram; and algae, some of which are particularly susceptible to iodine uptake, could contain up to 100 million becquerels per kilogram. Japan has legal limits of radioactivity in fish for human consumption of 500 becquerels per kilogram for caesium-137, and 2,000 becquerels per kilogram for iodine-131.""Doses will decrease very quickly with time and distance from the facility, if no further leaks occur, but there could remain a persistent low-dose component in the local marine environment for many years,"" says Thomas Hinton, deputy director of the IRSN's Laboratory of Radioecology, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Modelling in Cadarache, France. ""The impacts are best addressed through an international long-term assessment.""Ward Whicker, an environmental and radiological health expert at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, agrees that a survey would be worthwhile. ""It would require a great deal of sampling effort, near the discharge point as well as at locations farther away,"" he says. ""Concentrations of radionuclides in water, sediments, plankton, molluscs, crustaceans, seaweed and fish would need to be measured, and the health of the ecosystem monitored.""Although radioisotope concentrations in fish, shellfish and seaweed could exceed limits for human consumption for weeks, Whicker thinks that it is unlikely that scientists would be able to detect any genetic effects on marine life. Any affected creatures would probably disperse into the Pacific, or die more quickly, he says. Moreover, teasing out radiological effects from other stresses, such as conventional water pollution and the damage caused by the tsunami, would be extremely difficult.An alternative approach could be to focus on a suitable proxy species. ""In my opinion, brown seaweed should be the number one research priority,"" says Bruno Fievet, a radio­ecologist at the IRNS in Cherbourg. The brown seaweed Laminaria digitata, ubiquitous in the coastal Pacific waters off Japan, absorbs iodine to help defend itself against environmental stresses such as pollution. It can have iodine concentrations some 10,000 times greater than the surrounding sea water. ""This species is the world champion in iodine uptake, and it would be a good indicator of the radioactive labelling of other marine organisms,"" says Fievet.But sampling may be hampered by the danger that remains at the Fukushima plant. ""Any survey would be welcome,"" says Ulf Riebesell, a biological oceanographer at the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel, Germany. ""But I certainly wouldn't ask my students to do field work off Japan amid this ongoing crisis.""  "
1604,abhishek_sharma,13 Apr 2011 07:01 ,"Japan faces power struggle: Climate goals in doubt as fossil fuels come to the fore in fight to meet electricity demand.http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110412/full/472143a.htmlThe disaster at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant is putting the nation's ambitious plans to reduce carbon emissions under serious pressure. With few natural resources, Japan has long been forced to rely on imports of oil, coal and natural gas to provide about 80% of the energy needed to sustain its economy. Nuclear energy was supposed to help Japan limit these energy imports and cut its carbon emissions at the same time — but that was before Fukushima.The government has committed to reduce carbon emissions by 25% from 1990 levels by 2020, and by roughly 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. The short-term target is particularly ambitious, because Japan's streamlined economy is already among the most energy-efficient in the world. To achieve its goals, Japan had planned to build nine nuclear power plants over the coming decade and a total of 14 plants by 2030, all while squeezing as much power as possible out of the current 54 plants. By 2030, nuclear power was to have provided half of Japan's electricity, doubling its current contribution (see 'Nuclear power in Japan').A big question mark now hangs over those plans. Nearly a month after the magnitude-9.0 earthquake and the tsunami that followed, workers are still struggling to control the reactors at Fukushima. Four of the six reactors there have been destroyed; the other two will probably never run again; and plans for two new reactors have been abandoned (see page 146). Another eight reactors in the northwest of the country were automatically shut down after the 11 March earthquake. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Japan's largest private utility, which operates Fukushima Daiichi and three other nuclear plants with multiple reactors, is struggling to meet electricity demand in Tokyo. Japan's vulnerability was highlighted again on 7 April, when a magnitude-7.1 earthquake temporarily shut down several conventional power stations and left millions without electricity.No one knows when the situation will stabilize, nor what Japan's nuclear industry will look like when it does. Although several power firms say they will stick to construction schedules to meet the nuclear capacity goals, the Japanese government has ordered a review of its energy policy. ""They obviously have a predicament in that they have put a lot of eggs in the nuclear-power basket,"" says Ed Lyman, a nuclear expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington DC. ""It's hard to imagine that Fukushima isn't going to disrupt those plans.""The most immediate challenge is to meet the nation's electricity needs. The rolling blackouts introduced after the crisis began have stopped, thanks to reduced demand and energy conservation measures. But supplying enough power is difficult because Japan maintains two essentially incompatible electricity grids, a decision dating back more than a century. These grids carry alternating current at different frequencies, preventing large-scale diversion of electricity from power plants outside the affected region. There are no plans to unify the systems.In the short term, most experts agree that the crisis will force Japan to rely much more heavily on its natural-gas power stations, and potentially also its coal-fired plants. But increasing fossil-fuel use probably won't stop Japan from meeting its short-term carbon-emissions commitment under the Kyoto Protocol — a reduction of 6% below 1990 levels by 2012 — says Lisa Zelljadt, a senior analyst with the energy consultancy Thompson Reuters Point Carbon in Washington DC.Japan's emissions have increased significantly since 1990, so the country has been working to offset much of its emissions by paying for reductions in other countries. ""The only way that they were going to make their Kyoto commitments was by buying carbon credits,"" says Robert Stavins, an economist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Japan also moved a little closer towards its climate targets during the global economic crisis, when plunging economic output reduced emissions by 7% from 2007 to 2008. The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis will also help curb carbon output.All these factors should put Japan in a position to meet its Kyoto commitments, says Zelljadt. ""The nuclear disaster will thus affect more how Japan stands towards a longer-term target in the international negotiations,"" she says.In a move towards not just carbon-free energy but also energy self-sufficiency, Japan had outlined ambitious plans to develop an advanced nuclear-energy programme that would not only recycle spent nuclear fuel but also deploy fast-breeder reactors that produce more fuel than they burn (see Nature 464, 661; 2010).These efforts are a cornerstone of Japan's climate strategy, but they were under pressure even before the earthquake. Japan's Rokkasho reprocessing plant has suffered from numerous problems and will be some 15 years behind schedule if it opens as currently planned in 2012. The plant stores thousands of tonnes of spent nuclear fuel, and had to rely on backup diesel generators to cool the fuel after the plant lost power following last week's big aftershock.Meanwhile, a prototype fast-breeder reactor — dubbed Monju — has been plagued with problems (see Nature 434, 6; 2005). Fifteen years after a sodium coolant leak and a related fire led to its closure, Monju was briefly started up in 2010 only to be shut down once again after a non-nuclear accident.""It's a pretty grim story anywhere you look in Japan,"" says Lyman. ""You have to wonder how many nuclear failures they can put up with before throwing in the towel."" "

This is basically capturing heat that would have gone ""waste"" otherwise. So yeah, you use that to increase plant efficiency. Some of the best use of that kind of low grade heat is ironically in cooling/ A/c using Absorption Chillers /Coolers (google for it  or better still, ask our expert Chaanakya , who drops BIG BIG words like ""Rankine cycle"" about it), which is probably one of the most efficient methods of cooling .

1615,amit,13 Apr 2011 13:15 ,"Here's and interesting link. I think Amber posted something similar:Risks from reactor accidents are estimated by the rapidly developing science of ""probabilistic risk analysis"" (PRA). A PRA must be done separately for each power plant (at a cost of $5 million) but we give typical results here: A fuel melt-down might be expected once in 20,000 years of reactor operation. In 2 out of 3 melt-downs there would be no deaths, in 1 out of 5 there would be over 1000 deaths, and in 1 out of 100,000 there would be 50,000 deaths. The average for all meltdowns would be 400 deaths. Since air pollution from coal burning is estimated to be causing 10,000 deaths per year, there would have to be 25 melt-downs each year for nuclear power to be as dangerous as coal burning.Of course deaths from coal burning air pollution are not noticeable, but the same is true for the cancer deaths from reactor accidents. In the worst accident considered, expected once in 100,000 melt-downs (once in 2 billion years of reactor operation), the cancer deaths would be among 10 million people, increasing their cancer risk typically from 20% (the current U.S. average) to 20.5%. This is much less than the geographical variation--- 22% in New England to 17% in the Rocky Mountain states.Very high radiation doses can destroy body functions and lead to death within 60 days, but such ""noticeable"" deaths would be expected in only 2% of reactor melt-down accidents; there would be over 100 in 0.2% of meltdowns, and 3500 in 1 out of 100,000 melt-downs. To date, the largest number of noticeable deaths from coal burning was in an air pollution incident (London, 1952) where there were 3500 extra deaths in one week. Of course the nuclear accidents are hypothetical and there are many much worse hypothetical accidents in other electricity generation technologies; e.g., there are hydroelectric dams in California whose sudden failure could cause 200,000 deaths. "
1616,amit,13 Apr 2011 13:21 ,"Another  interesting document.According to a Lancet Study in 2007, compared with nuclear power, coal is responsible for five times as many worker deaths from accidents, 470 times as many deaths due to air pollution among members of the public, and more than 1,000 times as many cases of serious illness, according to a study of the health effects of electricity generation in Europe.In “Full cost accounting for the life cycle of coal,” published this year by a team of 12 researchers led by Paul R. Epstein of Harvard Medical School’s Center for Health and the Global Environment, the ledger included .02 cents per kilowatt hour for mental retardation caused by mercury in coal-plant emissions.Using similar methods, Markandya and his co-author in the Lancet study, Paul Wilkinson of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, found that in Europe coal is responsible for .12 deaths from accidents, 25 deaths from pollution and 225 cases of serious illness per terawatt (1,000 billion kilowatt) hour of electricity generated. In comparison, nuclear causes .02 accidental deaths, .05 pollution deaths and .22 cases of illness.It’s especially high in China, where three-quarters of the electricity is made by burning coal, mining accidents kill about 6,000 people a year, and hundreds of millions of people are affected by air pollution. In some inland cities, the economic cost to human health of making electricity from coal is as much as seven times higher than the cost of generating the electricity, according to a calculation by Stefan Hirschberg at the Paul Scherrer Institutin Switzerland, which has done energy system analysis for the European Commission."

Level 7 is the most serious level on INES and is used to describe an event comprised of ""A major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures"". Japanese authorities notified the IAEA in advance of the public announcement and the formal submission of the new provisional rating.The new provisional rating considers the accidents that occurred at Units 1, 2 and 3 as a single event on INES. Previously, separate INES Level 5 ratings had been applied for Units 1, 2 and 3. The provisional INES Level 3 rating assigned for Unit 4 still applies.The re-evaluation of the Fukushima Daiichi provisional INES rating resulted from an estimate of the total amount of radioactivity released to the environment from the nuclear plant. NISA estimates that the amount of radioactive material released to the atmosphere is approximately 10% of the 1986 Chernobyl accident, which is the only other nuclear accident to have been rated a Level 7 event.Earlier ratings of the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi were assessed as follows:On 18 March, Japanese authorities rated the core damage at the Fukushima Daiichi 1, 2 and 3 reactor Units caused by loss of all cooling function to have been at Level 5 on the INES scale. They further assessed that the loss of cooling and water supplying functions in the spent fuel pool of the Unit 4 reactor to have been rated at Level 3.Japanese authorities may revise the INES rating at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant as further information becomes available.INES is used to promptly and consistently communicate to the public the safety significance of events associated with sources of radiation.

NISA said it will conduct a separate investigation on how much radioactive materials have been released into the Pacific Ocean.Asked why NISA did not come forward with the data earlier if most of the release was made days after the disaster hit, Nishiyama said the agency wanted to gather a certain amount of data to make sure before making any assessment"

1640,chaanakya,13 Apr 2011 22:12 ,"TEPCO confirms damage to part of No. 4 unit's spent nuke fuelTOKYO, April 14, KyodoSome of the spent nuclear fuel rods stored in the No. 4 reactor building of the crisis-hit Fukushima Daiichi power plant were confirmed to be damaged, but most of them are believed to be in sound condition, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Wednesday.The firm known as TEPCO said its analysis of a 400-milliliter water sample taken Tuesday from the No. 4 unit's spent nuclear fuel pool revealed the damage to some fuel rods in such a pool for the first time, as it detected higher-than-usual levels of radioactive iodine-131, cesium-134 and cesium-137.The No. 4 reactor, halted for a regular inspection before last month's earthquake and tsunami disaster, had all of its 1,331 spent fuel rods and 204 unused fuel rods stored in the pool for the maintenance work and the fuel was feared to have sustained damage from overheating.The cooling period for 548 of the 1,331 rods was shorter than that for others and the volume of decay heat emitted from the fuel in the No. 4 unit pool is larger compared with pools at other reactor buildings.According to TEPCO, radioactive iodine-131 amounting to 220 becquerels per cubic centimeter, cesium-134 of 88 becquerels and cesium-137 of 93 becquerels were detected in the pool water. Those substances are generated by nuclear fission.The government's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said the confirmed radioactive materials were up to 100,000 times higher than normal but that the higher readings may have also been caused by the pouring of rainwater containing much radioactivity or particles of radiation-emitting rubble in the pool.The roof and the upper walls of the No. 4 reactor building have been blown away by a hydrogen explosion and damaged by fires since the disaster struck the plant. The water level in the spent fuel pool is believed to have temporarily dropped.TEPCO said the fuel rods may have also been damaged by steel frames that fell into the pool in addition to overheating caused by the loss of cooling functions after the twin disasters.The utility plans to examine the condition of the plant's reactor buildings by deploying a small unmanned helicopter to see whether it is possible to extract spent fuel from pools.The nuclear agency said now that the condition of the No. 4 unit pool is partially known, workers can better prepare for recovery works there.Earlier in the day, the government's nuclear regulatory agency ordered TEPCO to check the quake resistance of reactor buildings at the Fukushima plant, which have been rocked by strong aftershocks from the magnitude-9.0 earthquake that wrecked the site and triggered tsunami on March 11.The agency told the utility to immediately examine the buildings and consider reinforcement work if they are judged as not sufficiently quakeproof.In addition to the No. 4 unit, the Nos. 1 and 3 reactor buildings have also been severely damaged by hydrogen explosions in the early days of the crisis.''As strong aftershocks occur almost daily, we have to consider what will happen to buildings already damaged by blasts,'' said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the nuclear agency.He acknowledged the difficulties involved in the work to reinforce the quake resistance of the buildings, where radiation levels are high, but said, ''We must devise some ways.'' The agency urged TEPCO to report back to it on the matter as soon as possible.Meanwhile, Yoko Komiyama, senior vice minister of health, labor and welfare, said Wednesday at a Diet session that a total of 22 workers at the plant have been exposed to radiation exceeding 100 millisieverts as of early Wednesday and that the highest level of exposure among them is 198.24 millisieverts.Exposure to 100 millisieverts is the permissible level for nuclear plant workers dealing with an emergency, but the limit has been raised to 250 millisieverts for the ongoing crisis.Workers continued Wednesday to remove highly radioactive water in the plant as part of efforts to put an end to the emergency, which is now acknowledged as one of the world's worst nuclear disasters.TEPCO had pumped out 700 tons of highly polluted water by Wednesday evening from an underground tunnel-like trench to a ''condenser,'' where in normal operations steam from the reactor is converted into water.Eventually, the operator plans to remove a total of 60,000 tons of contaminated water, found in the basements of the Nos. 1 to 3 reactor turbine buildings as well as the trenches connected to them, and to store it in nearby tanks and other areas.As a result of the operation, the level of highly radioactive water that had been filling up the trench connected to the No. 2 reactor's turbine building was lowered. Nishiyama said it will likely take several weeks before the tainted water removal operation ends.The highly toxic water is believed to originate from the No. 2 reactor's core, where fuel rods have partially melted. The water, which has also affected other parts of the plant, is hampering efforts to restore the reactors' key cooling functions, lost in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.The nuclear agency also said TEPCO has installed three steel sheets near a seawater intake for the No. 2 reactor and set up ''silt fence'' curtain barriers near intakes for the Nos. 3-4 reactors at the six-reactor plant to block the spread of radioactive substances in water.Massive amounts of water have been poured into the reactors and their spent nuclear fuel pools as a stopgap measure to cool them down at the Fukushima plant.But pools of contaminated water have been detected in various parts of the nuclear complex on the Pacific coast, with some water leaking into the sea, as an apparent side effect of the emergency measure. TEPCO successfully stopped the leak of highly radioactive water from a cracked pit on April 6.==Kyodo"

But it is imperative for the data to be provided in more meaningful and user-friendly ways.Nature 472, 135 (14 April 2011) http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v472/n7342/full/472135a.htmlOne month after the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, there is still no clear picture of the further hazard posed by the wrecked nuclear reactors and spent fuel ponds at the Fukushima nuclear power plant (see page 146), and monitoring of fallout remains patchy. To improve the situation, better data, in more user-friendly forms, and more sophisticated analyses are essential. Compared with the 1979 Three Mile Island accident or the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, there is certainly much more information available about this latest nuclear accident — largely thanks to the Internet and online media. Japan's science ministry, and other bodies, have issued reams of data, including daily environmental radiation measurements — an admirable feat, given that the Japanese authorities are also having to deal with the huge aftermath of the quake and tsunami.But as Peter Sandman, a risk consultant based in Princeton, New Jersey (http://www.psandman.com/whatsnew.htm), points out, the authorities have failed badly to forewarn the public of a series of events that they must have known were likely to happen. This has resulted in nasty surprises such as radioactive pollution of the sea (see page 145), foods and tap water — as well as this week's upgrading of the accident to level 7, the highest on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale and matched only by Chernobyl. As a result, many people now do not trust the authorities to tell them if the situation is likely to worsen, sapping public confidence.The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which runs the Fukushima plant, has also on at least four occasions had to retract as incorrect its findings on the amount and composition of radionuclides in areas in and around the plant, or on reactor parameters. This has created uncertainty and public mistrust in the company's monitoring abilities. In its defence, damaged plant instrumentation means that key data on events inside the reactors are sometimes missing or unreliable. Even so, the most complete and credible publicly available analyses of possible reactor-event scenarios have come not from Japan, but from outside scientists, nuclear-reactor makers and regulatory authorities.Similarly, it is pertinent to ask why, so far, the only detailed publicly available forecasts of the direction and concentration of atmospheric radionuclide plumes have come from overseas agencies. The Japanese almost certainly have data that would allow much higher-resolution forecast maps of Fukushima and the surrounding areas. Although the Japanese authorities are releasing data daily on radiation levels in the air, soil and water, these are scattered across multiple, individual web pages. This uncoordinated approach was excusable in the early days, but data collection and presentation urgently need to improve. The authorities have also failed to provide vital context on how these exposure rates translate (or not) into what matters to people, such as health effects, and where they make farming impossible. The recurring narrative that this or that radiation dose is as much as would be given by an X-ray or a CT scan doesn't cut it, as health effects, for example, depend most on accumulated doses over long times.Information on fallout distribution made public by the government and TEPCO also lacks basic metadata, such as the latitude and longitude of sampling points or the sampling protocols used, and results are presented as static PDFs from which researchers cannot easily extract the data. As a result, it is next to impossible for academic researchers and others to compile and map the daily reports and gain a better picture of the situation and of changes over time and space. The Japanese authorities, the International Atomic Energy Agency and other bodies with relevant information must present it as dynamic data and high-resolution maps that also show day-to-day variation, total net cumulative soil deposition and where hotspots are, and as models of what's happening overall rather than just spot counts.Data analysis should also not be left to governments alone. Researchers are rightly calling for an independent group to process the data and publish evidence-based risk assessments. They also want data in machine-readable formats, such as spreadsheets, databases and spatial data formats. This would unleash the diverse creativity of academic researchers, journalists, software geeks and mappers, who are often better equipped, and more agile than governments and international agencies, to present data online in timely, informative and compelling ways. To convert raw data into high-quality, user-friendly forms is not a luxury, but essential for helping to build public trust.Shake-up time for Japanese seismologyhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature10105.htmlSummaryThe Japanese government should admit to the public that earthquakes cannot be reliably predicted.Use of the misleading term 'Tokai earthquake' should cease.The 1978 Large-Scale Earthquake Countermeasures Act should be repealed.For the past 20 years or so, some seismologists in Japan have warned of the seismic and tsunami hazards to the safety of nuclear power plants, most notably Katsuhiko Ishibashi, now professor emeritus at Kobe University. Their warnings went unheeded. Yet in the immediate aftermath of the magnitude-9.1 earthquake that struck Tohoku on 11 March, pundits could be found on many Japanese TV stations saying that it was “unforeseeable”.The 'foreseen' earthquakes were presumably the hypothetical future earthquakes used by the Japanese government to produce national seismic hazard maps for Japan1. The modellers assume that 'characteristic earthquakes' exist for various zones, choose the fault parameters for each zone as the input to their model, and then produce probabilistic hazard maps.Online collectionAlthough such maps may seem authoritative, a model is just a model until the methods used to produce it have been verified. The regions assessed as most dangerous are the zones of three hypothetical 'scenario earthquakes' (Tokai, Tonankai and Nankai; see map). However, since 1979, earthquakes that caused 10 or more fatalities in Japan actually occurred in places assigned a relatively low probability. This discrepancy — the latest in a string of negative results for the characteristic earthquake model and its cousin, the seismic-gap model2, 3, 4 — strongly suggests that the hazard map and the methods used to produce it are flawed and should be discarded.Globally, in the past 100 years, there have been five subduction-zone earthquakes of magnitude 9 or greater (Kamchatka 1952, Chile 1960, Alaska 1964, Sumatra 2004, Tohoku 2011), which suggests that the upper limit on the possible size of a subduction-zone earthquake may not much depend on the details of the subduction modality5. Large tsunamis have frequently struck the Pacific coast of the Tohoku district. The well-documented 1896 Sanriku tsunami had a maximum height of 38 metres and caused more than 22,000 deaths. The 869 Jogan tsunami is documented to have had a height roughly comparable to, or perhaps slightly less than, that of the 11 March tsunami.If global seismicity and the historical record in Tohoku had been used as the basis for estimating seismic hazards, the 11 March Tohoku earthquake could easily have been 'foreseen' in a general way, although not of course its particular time, epicentre or magnitude. Countermeasures for dealing with such events could and should have been incorporated in the initial design of the Fukushima nuclear power plants.The 'Tokai earthquake'In the 1960s, plate tectonics became generally accepted as the fundamental paradigm of solid-Earth geoscience. Researchers in several countries made efforts to combine plate tectonics with seismicity data to make long-term forecasts of large earthquakes. The idea was very simple. It was hypothesized that zones where no large earthquakes had occurred for a while, dubbed 'seismic gaps', were ripe for imminent large events. However, the seismic-gap hypothesis failed the test of reality2. Over tens of thousands of years or longer, the net slip released by earthquakes and aseismic slip must match net inter-plate motion. But we now know that this catching-up process does not occur regularly or cyclically, as is further underscored by the 11 March earthquake.In the mid-1970s, when enthusiasm for the seismic-gap model was still widespread in the global geoscience community, several researchers in Japan proposed that the plate boundary off the Tokai district was a seismic gap where a magnitude-8 earthquake could be expected6. The neighbouring Tonankai and Nankai districts were also labelled as being seismic gaps7. No large earthquake has occurred in any of these districts since 1975, but they are still classified as the most hazardous regions in the country by the Japanese government (see map).Over the past 30 years or so, government spokesmen and university scientists associated with the government's Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion (or its various predecessors) have used the term 'Tokai earthquake' so often that the public and news media have come to view it as a 'real earthquake' rather than merely an arbitrary scenario (1.78 million hits in a Japanese-language Google search). This misleads the public into believing that the clock is ticking down inexorably on a magnitude-8 earthquake that is certain to strike the Tokai district in the near future. Use of the term 'Tokai earthquake' (and its companions 'Tonankai earthquake' and 'Nankai earthquake') should therefore cease.Unpredictable earthquakesThroughout most of seismological history, the prediction of earthquakes hours or days in advance has, for good reason, been regarded with great scepticism8 (see http://go.nature.com/ahc6nx). However, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, several studies, initially by researchers in the Soviet Union, and followed by similarly positive studies from major US institutions, led to a burst of optimism. The editors of Nature wrote in 1973 that the “situation is in some ways similar to that in 1939 when nuclear fission suddenly became a reality”9. Positive results were also published at roughly the same time in Science and some leading speciality journals.The positive reports were based on claims to have observed 'precursors' of earthquakes. For example, some studies of the type discussed in Nature's 1973 article claimed to have observed decreases of 10–20% in crustal seismic velocities before earthquakes, with the return of the velocities to their normal values being the sign that an earthquake was imminent. But the 1976 earthquake in Tangshan, China, which caused a reported 240,000 fatalities, was not predicted, and by the late 1970s it had become clear to most researchers that the supposed precursors were artefacts. The prediction boom then largely died out, but like many similar examples (such as polywater and cold fusion), die-hard holdouts in several countries continue to make precursor claims.Baseless prediction lawBy the mid-1970s, public discussion of the supposedly imminent Tokai earthquake reached quasi-panic levels. This was exploited by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and university scientists, who persuaded the Japanese parliament to enact the Large-Scale Earthquake Countermeasures Act (LECA) in 1978. This law in effect requires the JMA to operate a 24/7 monitoring system to detect precursors indicating that the 'Tokai earthquake' (see map) will occur within up to three days. If and when signals thought to be precursors are ever observed, a panel of five geophysicists will review the data, the JMA director will inform the prime minister, and the cabinet will then declare a state of emergency, which will stop almost all activity in a wide area around the Tokai district.This law, which has no precedent in any other country, presumes of course that reliable precursors exist. In particular, on the basis of one report of a geodetic precursor of an earthquake in Japan in 1944 (see Fig. 2 in ref. 6), geodetic slip is the main target of the JMA observations. The 1944 data, taken far from the epicentral region, were interpreted as possibly suggesting uplift of a few centimetres due to slow slip on a deep part of the fault shortly before the main shock. Unfortunately, the data were measured using antiquated surveying techniques, and are subject to considerable uncertainty. Nothing of this type has ever been observed using Global Positioning System devices or other modern measurement techniques. A famous report of a supposed geodetic precursor, the 'Palmdale Bulge', in the United States in the 1970s was later shown to be an artefact8.Basing even a large-scale programme of observational research on the 1944 data would be uncalled for. It beggars belief, then, that the Japanese government operates a legally binding earthquake-prediction system on this basis. The JMA's official home page says (author's translation): “At present the only place a system for predicting earthquakes exists is for a magnitude-8 earthquake with an epicenter offshore Suruga Bay, i.e. the 'Tokai earthquake'. Science and technology have not progressed sufficiently to allow other earthquakes to be predicted.” But there are many more observatories now than in 1978. If it really were possible to predict the 'Tokai earthquake' then, surely it would be possible to predict all magnitude-8 earthquakes now.Time for opennessHow is it that the Tokai prediction system has been in place for more than 30 years, with barely a whimper from most mainstream Japanese seismologists? The reasons for this silence are complex. First, many researchers have been co-opted in various ways (such as with funding and committee memberships). Second, government decisions are nominally reviewed, but review panels are chosen by bureaucrats of the agency being reviewed. Third, cogent criticisms do get reported by print media, but are usually ignored by broadcasters, so critics don't get much traction. Fourth, through the 'press club' system, the government pipes its views directly into the media, often through reporters lacking in scientific knowledge. Finally, as long as the LECA stays on the books, the government can claim that it is obligated by law to try to predict the Tokai earthquake.It is time to tell the public frankly that earthquakes cannot be predicted, to scrap the Tokai prediction system and to repeal the LECA. All of Japan is at risk from earthquakes, and the present state of seismological science does not allow us to reliably differentiate the risk level in particular geographic areas. We should instead tell the public and the government to 'prepare for the unexpected'10 and do our best to communicate both what we know and what we do not. And future basic research in seismology must be soundly based on physics, impartially reviewed, and be led by Japan's top scientists rather than by faceless bureaucrats."

The government and TEPCO will soon start talks over how to pay for the damages.According to the draft plan, TEPCO would pay 100 billion yen to 200 billion yen every year from its annual profit for 15 years to pay for damages. In addition, it would pay 510 billion yen to 850 billion yen for the mutual aid program, representing the charge assessed for its 17 nuclear reactors.The other power companies own a total of 37 nuclear reactors around Japan. Each company will pay a charge based on the number of nuclear reactors it owns.

In addition, if the total compensation required exceeds the amount shouldered by the utilities, the excess would be fully covered by the government, according to the draft plan.However, power companies not related to the crippled Fukushima plant are likely to protest strongly if they are required to share the compensation burden with TEPCO.(Apr. 14, 2011)"
1651,chaanakya,14 Apr 2011 09:19 ,"Disassembly of N-reactors a joint effort? / Toshiba seeks cooperation of rival HitachiGone with the Wind, finally a ten year epic decommissioning plan seems to be taking shape.Fukushima may still be inhabited by some thousands of technicians etc involved in decommissioning while original residents who were evacuated would resettle elsewhere while becoming Nuclear IDP, Of the six nuclear reactors at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant, the Nos. 1 to 4 reactors need to be decommissioned. It is the first time in the world for four reactors to face such severe trouble simultaneously.The No. 1 reactor was manufactured by General Electric Co., the No. 2 by GE and Toshiba, the No. 3 by Toshiba and the No. 4 by Hitachi.Toshiba has called for Hitachi to decommission the reactors jointly, as the difficult task may face rough going in the aftermath of hydrogen explosions that occurred at the Nos. 1 and 3 reactors.Hitachi has reportedly shown a positive stance on a joint decommissioning project with Toshiba. Even if the plan is realized, the work will take at least 10 years.On April 4, Toshiba made a proposal on decommissioning to TEPCO, jointly with four U.S. companies, including its subsidiary Westinghouse Electric Co. Under that plan, the decommissioning work would be completed in about 10 years at the earliest.Specifically, the work of cooling the interior of the overheated reactors and removing debris would be done in the next six months, while the following five years would be spent on removing fuel rods from the reactor and spent fuel rods from a storage pool. In the final five years, the buildings housing the reactors and other equipment would be dismantled, along with the reactors themselves, while the contaminated ground would undergo soil improvement and the whole lot would be left vacant.Development of German-style eco-town eyed after nuclear crisisTOKYO, April 13, KyodoPrime Minister Naoto Kan is considering developing an environmentally friendly town with a population of about 50,000 to 100,000 in the event residents need to leave their homes near the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant for many years, a person close to the premier said Wednesday.Kan is thinking of designing a downtown area ''modeled on a German garden city,'' Kenichi Matsumoto, a renowned writer who serves as a special adviser to the Cabinet, told reporters after a meeting with the premier.While no luck for Fukushima Laconium, we could have Davis Besse Laconium though, pools are irreparably damaged.http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201104130196.htmlThe buildings housing the Fukushima plant's No. 1, No. 3 and No. 4 reactors have all been damaged, leaving storage pools exposed, and equipment normally used in the removal process may also have been knocked out by the explosions.High levels of radiation are also likely to prove a major obstacle to the removal effort, which sources said TEPCO has been formulating since March.Water was collected from the No. 4 reactor storage pool on Tuesday to check on the condition of the spent fuel rods. The No. 4 reactor is of particular concern to TEPCO officials.<snip>A major difference between the two accidents, however, is that the reactor building at Three Mile Island was not damaged. The wrecked buildings at Fukushima have led to high radiation levels on the plant site.A TEPCO executive said, ""It will be impossible to conduct the work now because of the high radiation levels.""An official with the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said of the plan: ""It cannot be carried out unless radiation levels fall to a point that ensures the safety of the workers.""Some TEPCO officials say the removal of the spent fuel rods could take several years."

""Remember there is no one left ... around the reactor, it has been evacuated.""While we need to keep watch over public health issues for next 20 years , WHO saysThe World Health Organization says there is no need for new public health measures against the nuclear incident at the Fukushima nuclear plant at the moment. But it says studies may be needed to keep watch over public health for up to 20 years.WHO Director of Public Health and the Environment Maria Neira held a news conference on Wednesday after the Japanese government raised the severity level of the nuclear accident to a maximum 7 on the international scale.She said that public health measures taken by the Japanese government, including enforcing an evacuation zone and relocating nearby residents, are appropriate.But she also said the organization will need to reassess the situation almost on an hourly basis, because the situation is not yet under control.Neira said studies will have to be conducted over the next 10 to 20 years, to keep a watch over any public health issues."

1654,chaanakya,14 Apr 2011 09:35 ,"Child-rearing benefits face ax / Handouts to be abolished to free up funds for quake reconstructionThe Yomiuri ShimbunThe government and the ruling Democratic Party of Japan are set to abolish the child-rearing allowance system in October, which could free up some of the huge funds needed for earthquake disaster reconstruction efforts, according to sources.The current stopgap legislation maintains the payment of 13,000 yen per month for each child through September. The government and the DPJ have begun coordinating on legislative moves to abolish the system when the period expires, having judged it would be difficult to secure fiscal resources to finance the allowances after last month's Great East Japan Earthquake, the sources said.Child benefits, however, would continue based on the previous system of dependent child allowances with income caps, introduced during the administration of the Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner New Komeito, with some modifications, according to the sources.The DPJ-led administration, which came to power in 2009, introduced the child-rearing allowance system in 2010 under a law enacted as temporary legislation effective for fiscal 2010.For this fiscal year, the government submitted a bill to the current Diet session to raise the amount of payments for households with children under 3 years old to 20,000 yen per month. But it gave up on efforts to enact the legislation due to resistance from the opposition camp.With support from the opposition Japanese Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, the government passed the stopgap legislation to keep the same level of payments from last fiscal year through September.However, the government and the DPJ have decided to give priority to disaster reconstruction funding. Continuing the current payment system after September would cost about 1.1 trillion yen, the sources said.If and when the current child allowance system is abolished or allowed to expire, the previous system of income-capped dependent child allowances, based on a permanent law, would automatically be reinstated.Komeito, which wants the previous system revived, has proposed modifying the system, such as uniformly setting payments at 10,000 yen per month and imposing no income caps on residents in disaster-hit areas. Under the previous system, the payments were 5,000 yen or 10,000 yen per child depending on certain conditions regarding the age and number of children targeted. The Komeito proposal is expected to cost about 600 billion yen.The government and the DPJ are considering using the Komeito proposal as a basis and allocating the other 500 billion yen in a second supplementary budget for this fiscal year, which is expected to be devoted exclusively to disaster reconstruction measures.Some DPJ executive board members are even calling for a shift to the previous system before October, to curb the issuance of deficit-covering government bonds in the envisaged second extra budget."

Despite the heroic efforts of the remaining workers at the nuclear complex, it seems likely that two reactor cores will melt down and two spent fuel ponds will ignite, spewing radioactivity into the ground, air, and waterIt might be tempting to blame hysterical media coverage for this reaction, but in this case, most coverage I've seen has actually been fairly sober and cautiousThe bigger problem has been the overly optimistic scenarios and conflicting information released by Japanese authorities. The public, not only in Japan but worldwide, simply no longer believes those in authority who tell them they are not in danger. This will make it difficult to manage the public response to the crisis going forward and may pose a grave risk for the future of the nuclear industry. In an effort, perhaps, to keep the public calm, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) which owns the reactors, and the Japanese government which regulates them have limited the information released and constantly portrayed the situation as under control. The facts have spoken otherwise. The widening gap has now triggered a collapse of confidence on the part of the Japanese public and, it appears, the U.S. government. Brookings Institution scholar Daniel Kaufmann notes that TEPCO ""infuriated Japan's prime minister, who learned of the first plant explosion at reactor 1 on Saturday from watching TV."" In the early days of the crisis, TEPCO officials denied that water levels had fallen in reactors and fuel storage pools, but hours later announced extraordinary measures to pump new water in. Please, please please, don't ask rhetorical questions."
1667,amit,14 Apr 2011 14:27 ,"Talking about Foreign Policy Magazine, it also published a very interesting interview with Stewart Brand on March 22. In case you're wondering who Brand is, here's what FP says:In 2005, Stewart Brand, then four decades into his career as a countercultural gadfly, environmental thinker, and futurist, published an attention-grabbing essay in MIT Technology Review called ""Environmental Heresies"". Brand argued that in order to achieve the aims of ecological sustainability that he had advocated in the Whole Earth Catalog, the hippie omnium gatherum and Boomer cultural touchstone Brand began publishing in 1968, environmentalists would have to rethink a number of their core beliefs -- including the movement's historic aversion to nuclear power. Folks read it in full. And please note he's not a nooklear lobby expert but an environmentalist.SB: What hasn't changed is climate vulnerability and growing economic needs, especially in the developing world for clean, base-load electricity. And we're learning some important new stuff on levels of safety under exceptional duress, which is what happened in Japan. I expect there will be a fair amount of review of safety procedures, equipment, training, and whatnot. And this will be an experience in the industry that everybody will be learning from, much as Three Mile Island was and to some extent Chernobyl was. The main event, the century-size problem we're looking at, is climate change. {Sounds familiar?} But frankly, if climate were not an issue by now, I would still be saying we need to go nuclear because it is the alternative to coal -- and coal is all by itself such very large-scale, long-term bad news. Billions of people are getting out of poverty in the developing world. For that to go forward, one of the needs and demands they all have is for more electricity. So on those grounds alone I think there is a reason to proceed with nuclear. FP: Why go nuclear? Why not go with wind farms, or solar, or hydropower?SB: Hydropower is good. Hydropower is pretty maxed out, but obviously China is still building a lot more dams so those will go forward. Wind power is pretty good. It uses up a lot terrain and so far it is still an inconstant source. Solar, solar thermal, is looking good compared to photovoltaic, which is terrific on roofs and for very local usage like that. The major large-scale use of solar that looks promising right now is solar thermal in places like North Africa where you have a mineral desert where you really don't care if a lot of it is covered with mirrors.But people have been expecting a Moore's Lawfor solar, and self-accelerating technologies do not apply so far in energy technology. {The expectation that it does is very high on BRF} Solar panels get better, but really, really slowly. Likewise, wind basically got better by getting bigger. Nuclear was unusual in that it was a real step-function change in energy efficiency, similar to moving from burning wood to run civilization to burning coal, and later oil. It took a lot of engineering nuance to get them to really work, but once you did that, you didn't look back. Nuclear is that category of jump. We keep looking for more of those jumps, but they're all incremental. FP: The incident in Japan has been a crash course in all the things that we worry about with nuclear power. Are those things that you weigh in your calculus when you're looking at this? And, why don't those weigh heavier than some of these other factors?SB: Well I think it's a crash course for everybody. It sort of reminds me of the energy crisis in '73 when basically civilization as a whole suddenly was forced to look at an X-ray of its own metabolism in terms of our energy uses: where it was coming from, where the vulnerabilities were, how effective cost changes were, things like that. This time I'm noticing in the public media, compared to Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, there's a lot more sophistication: taking technical details seriously, people paying attention to dosage of radiation and realizing that not all radiation is instantly lethal, which I think was the view that was held by many for a long time.  {Thanks Amber for trying to hammer precisely this very same point here despite abuse and flak} Also, people are catching on that one of the advantages, I suppose, of radiation as a hazardous [substance] is that it's really easy to measure and really easy to measure accurately. SB: I think so. I think we're further along. People are catching on that electricity is of the essence and they don't want the lights to go out. And nuclear has been a part of it long enough, with a good enough safety record in most cases, that it's not new and frightening. And climate has forced us to look at the whole portfolio of both dirty energy sources and clean energy sources, {OK, I think I can claim a small bit of credit for trying to say the same thing time and again} and environmentalists are catching on that wind is not free. It's not only a very intermittent, but a rather thin source of energy, so you use up a lot of landscape to get a gigawatt of electricity. The same goes for solar. And they're all more expensive than coal. So the idea of ""Don't worry, nuclear can solve all our problems,"" went away, but it's still part of the portfolio solution. I think also that [what] we're getting from Japan is some perspective. There was a dam that failed in the Fukushima area and 1,800 homes were apparently damaged or destroyed, washed away. But you don't hear much discussion like, ""Well, should we not build any more dams?"" Is hydroelectric power now in great danger as a potential source of electricity?  {Ok this has been discussed on BRF also with the Tehri example, good to see we're not to far off the mark in our analysis} No. Likewise, there have been petrochemical refinery fires and explosions with horrendous footage and loss of life, as well as major industrial loss. And we're not talking about shutting down refineries because a really severe earthquake can harm them. "

That is why nuclear does so much better in land use.And one thing about hydropower - small hydro and run of the river is good - 30-50 percent PLF can be achieved.But something that people just don't understand about pumped storage plants i.e reservoir based plants - they are peaking stations and do not add net energy to the grid on an annual basis. They use more power on a yearly basis to increase the reservoir level than they actually contribute to the grid.They are used as peaking stations because of their ability to fire up quickly and wind down quickly.
1672,Lalmohan,14 Apr 2011 17:36 ,"well exactly, pump storage only really works if you have surplus capacity at non-peak demand timesit is conservation in a sense, but far from efficient at a macro level"
1673,D Roy,14 Apr 2011 17:43 ,"Its potential energy that is turned into electrical energy at a time of your choosing. But getting that potential energy itself requires conversion of electrical energy from the grid. And on a net basis the reservoir (PSP) ends up consuming more energy than its generates.Its purpose is to add installed capacity to the grid. Of course it can also serve as a back-up for intermittent sources as it does for wind in Norway.But somebody at the macro level has to generate more on a net basis to make this PSP-renewable linkeage viable and that unfortunately is still coal.On the other hand a new generation of load following nuclear plants can actually help increase the penetration of renewable power in the grid directly and exisiting nuke baseload stations can do that by backing up the grid itself.You see, when you actually work as a grid manager you realize how difficult it is to operate wind based power. The grid has to be on constant stand by since we are dealing with an intermittent source and has to factor in back-up power for the capacity lost due to intermittency. This is something most of these green kooks don't understand- that grid managers cannot plan on a wishful basis , a certain capacity is planned and it has to be met and the grid frequency maintained or their will be a major trip.Locally significant trips happen more regularly in Tamil Nadu than any other state in India. There is a reason for that. Just talk to any SLRDC guy and he'll tell you the tales of woe."

They will never quote a real expert.  Implication would be ""scientific community is divided"". While in real life, it is virtually 99% vs 1% (*** Edited Later *** (reference was  to one other such situation which a few brfites might be familiar.. basic point was  that there are similar cases where a  few renegade have much bigger voice)Getting back to the quote above, the reporter could have talked to any first-year physics student to know that:1) Finding radioactive particles in rain water in Romania is actually expected.  I had a post (and actual numbers) for water in my backyard in Ohio.  It will break law of diffusion if one did NOT get a particle there. 2) Forget about Fukushima,  One would  expect to get *many* molecules of  air in every breath one takes, which  came out from the dying breath of Babur.

(b) The impact of the Fukushima disaster is enormous, and demonstrates the inherent risks of nuclear power which have been consistently underestimated.

There are homes and businesses and farms that have been abandoned - assets as well as economic activity that represent a huge long term loss, especially in a crowded country like Japan. People in tsunami-hit zones outside the exclusion zone have been returning and rebuilding for a couple of weeks now. The impact of a nuclear industrial disaster in these terms seems even greater than something like, say, Bhopal with its horrific death toll.  The next question is whether this is an irrational perception because of greater public sensitivity to radioactive contamination as opposed to other kinds of pollution (eg. dioxin or heavy metal contamination of surface and ground water), or because fallout from nuclear accidents disperses in ways in fundamentally more pervasive ways, extending health hazard and clean-up zones?There has to be a psychological angle here - accidents seem to be treated in ways that are different from routine pollution.apart from a few places like California, public demands for emission control are much weaker despite the fact that pollution kills and sickens hundreds of thousands in cities all over the world in ways that are very well documented."

Despite the heroic efforts of the remaining workers at the nuclear complex, it seems likely that two reactor cores will melt down and two spent fuel ponds will ignite, spewing radioactivity into the ground, air, and waterIt might be tempting to blame hysterical media coverage for this reaction, but in this case, most coverage I've seen has actually been fairly sober and cautiousThe bigger problem has been the overly optimistic scenarios and conflicting information released by Japanese authorities. The public, not only in Japan but worldwide, simply no longer believes those in authority who tell them they are not in danger. This will make it difficult to manage the public response to the crisis going forward and may pose a grave risk for the future of the nuclear industry. In an effort, perhaps, to keep the public calm, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) which owns the reactors, and the Japanese government which regulates them have limited the information released and constantly portrayed the situation as under control. The facts have spoken otherwise. The widening gap has now triggered a collapse of confidence on the part of the Japanese public and, it appears, the U.S. government. Brookings Institution scholar Daniel Kaufmann notes that TEPCO ""infuriated Japan's prime minister, who learned of the first plant explosion at reactor 1 on Saturday from watching TV."" In the early days of the crisis, TEPCO officials denied that water levels had fallen in reactors and fuel storage pools, but hours later announced extraordinary measures to pump new water in. Please, please please, don't ask rhetorical questions.Sir, I repeat my question - when has TEPCO said 'all is well every thing under control'. This is a member of the Dork Media simply extrapolating and making up stories as he goes along (like many on the forum). He got the 'will get worse progressively' wrong as well. The INES 7 rating is based on the radiations release on March 15 and 16.To me this piece looks very much like a media person defending his hysterical ilk (according to him they were 'sober and cautious'  ) by accusing the other party of misinformation.

Now all available data shows that despite being 40 year plants and Gen I all the reactors that were operational automatically started shutting down with the control rods inserted. Then the tsunami stuck and wiped out those generators and the cooling process was interrupted which eventually resulted in those hydrogen explosions.The rest has been, I personally feel, a tale of great perseverance, courage and honesty on the part of the Japanese to tame the situation. (I know Sanku would disagree but...).There has been radiation leakage and the situation still has not been brought under control and the Japanese have in a rare show of candor raised the Level to 7 and stuck to it despite being criticized for doing so by many folks including the Russians of the Chernobyl fame.It has also been said by the Japanese as well as independent experts that the situation will take many months to get under control and then many years for the clean-up. Efforts are on now to make sure the situation does not get out of control and I think the Japanese have done a great job so far. However, I'm not a neutral observer  so your POV may differ from mine.Now the point to note if you've ever studied how news media functions across the globe is, Fukushima is a sexy story and will be in the news till such time that every thing quietens down. And given the 24X7 nature of news, print, online, radio, TV etc we're going to get all manner of reports and sound bytes, from that ridiculous Energy News report posted on the last page by Sanku (I suggest you try to read and make sense of the Maths, if you can, then please teach me) to in depth interviews with both nuclear scientists as well as those vehemently opposed to any form of nuclear technology like the American Michio Kaku.Sorry for this long preamble but it was necessary.Now coming to the main point, which is directly linked to your comment. On a forum like BRF, which is fixed on looking at every news/event from the POV of what does it mean for India, I'm sure you'll agree it serves no purpose to go on a muck raking expedition to find the most outrageous negative news about Japan - most of them by well-known quacks and Nuclear non proliferation Ayatollahs like Joe Cirincione - without answering the question of what lessons are learnt from this tragedy?Now here your pro and anti nuclear comment becomes important.Since you made that comment, I'm sure you've given it some serious thought before pressing the enter button on your keyboard.As a member of the so-called pro-camp, I can say that the position (much nuanced than what I'm writing by the way) of this camp is, to put it simply,  yes this is a serious accident and we need to learn lessons from this to ensure that our present N-plants and future ones are built and protected in such a way that they can withstand a Black Swan event like this one. Related to that is the point that despite all the troubles at Fukushima, nobody has died yet as a result of the incident, in fact nobody is permanent sick also due to radiation. Now can you please tell what exactly is the position of the anti-nuclear camp as you say, especially of it stalwarts? I can see that apart from Theo (one reason, I must reiterate, that I respect hims so much) nobody has come out and said that look we should abandon nuclear power generation, it's too dangerous. I disagree with him but then he's as much entitled to his POV as I am or anybody else is.But can you educate us as to what exactly do you think is the POV, stand, position or whatever, is of the other stalwarts of the anti nuclear camp? It would be nice if you could educate us on that - that would seal your neutral observer status.Incidentally when you see a fist fight it's always important to see who threw the first punch because nobody is going to turn the other cheek. Who for example called other posters ""habitual liars"", ""working for foreign masters"", ""hating Indians and India"" and several other gems.

Not sure if you clicked on the link itself.You can find a number of statements by TEPCO before overwhelming evidence forced them to retract.These include--- No loss of water in pools--- Reactor under control and no fear of explosion--- No radiation leak despite the roof getting blown off.There are tons and tons of reports already linked. 1000000000 in this thread itself, in fact that is the PRECISE reason I took trouble to post all the reports, since I knew that some one was likely to say ""Ramayan does not say it is Ram's story, it could be Laxman's story too""The only recourse then the people who took ""all izz well and its only media that is hysterical"" -- have is now to deny the very existence of such reports.

But then I guess it's difficult for you to wrap your head around something which is ongoing and evolving.Things were and dynamic at the reactors and the first few days, in fact nearly a week they couldn't even send workers into the nuclear plant both for fear of radiation and due to the infrastructure breakdown around the plant.So if you want convince anyone you've got to assign dates on when Tepco said no loss of water in pools. When they said reactor under controls and no fear of explosion. (Incidentally I think you're being economical with the truth here because the first hydrogen explosion occurred on March11-12 itself so it's highly unlikely TEPCO said this).Also, I'd like to see where TEPCO said no radiation leak despite the roof getting blow off and if so which date.You're sitting with 20/20 hindsight that one gets after more than a month and then saying TEPCO was lying when discussing the first reactions to the event in the first few days.Par to for the course.PS: I remember watching the 9/11 disaster unfolding on TV (CNN) on that fateful day in September 2001. I remember minutes after the first plane crashed in, which no TV crew could capture because they were not prepared, the CNN report at the site said it appears a small byplane has crashed into the Tower I. I suppose he was lying through his teeth because afterall it was a CIA conspiracy right?You may not get the link with the above to TEPCO giving information about the disaster but I'm sure other posters will do."

The factory is now shuttered, and high-tech firms like Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and Lenovo are bracing for shortages. Tokyo's famous Tsukiji fish market, the largest in the world and normally packed with tourists, is still a fraction of what it used to be. Daily sales at the market are down 60 percent. Last month's earthquake knocked a quarter of Japan's nuclear power generation offline, and the Fukushima reactors alone make up a full half of Tepco's nuclear capacity.The disaster at Fukushima has put a premature end to the Europe-based ""nuclear renaissance,"" a post-post-Chernobyl movement toward expanding nuclear energy that had the International Energy Agency predicting nuclear would grow from 6 percent of total global energy supply to more than 11 percent by 2035.

Theo, You need a sense of perspective here. Before this disaster TEPCO on its own generated more electricity than the total output of Spain. And mind you Spain is no backwater. There's bound to be disruptions not only due to Fukushima but also due to the general devastation. We shouldn't forget about that.Lost in the heat and debate was a small nugget of information. A dam in the Fukushima prefecture burst and washed away 1,800 homes minutes after the earthquake. It would be an immense act of providence if nobody were in those 1,800 homes when this happened. On its own this would have been a global headline story but it got lost in the thousands killed in the earthquake and tsunami.The fact that despite the crisis which happened in early March, Japan still managed 58.3 per cent utilization rate, IMO, speaks volumes about the robustness of the designs and the efficiency with which the Japanese run these plants."

There are some valid questions raised by many people ( not just the people on BRF), links of which were posted here. One was how GE pushed its design for approval even though it knew that there were some deficiencies in its designs. These were later ordered to be changed by the US regulators, which the Japanese appear to have not done. Then there are other issues related to nuclear site cleanup, groundwater contamination due to long term storage of nuclear waste etc. If the Japanese nuclear accident was as insignificant as it is made out to be on this thread, I guess the Japanese nuclear commission wouldn't be raising the severity level to seven.What I am worried about is that the corporates will push their designs even with known design limitations as GE did, for they are motivated by strong profits. TEPCO did not make those design changes presumably because of extra expenses it would cost them. Similarly is their assumption of max tsunami heights given Japan's previous experience. Given the corruption endemic in India, and the political game of rewarding all major NSG countries with nuclear parks inspite of delays in their implementations(whether russian or french, or US) or design, I do have my doubts on the safety of these reactors, especially as there will be multiple high capacity reactors in one area. And the destructive nature of nuclear reactors as seen in the japanese accident does raise red flags for me.I do understand the limitations of fossil fuel, and the relatively high imports that we face, as also the technological and financial limitations of wind /solar/tidal power projects. It is still a conflict in my mind as to the exact mix of various power projects we need to go for. Maybe an independent nuclear regulator who will go through the design and validate each design before awarding them projects, with the projects themselves being awarded in a transparent manner, say an auction, where in both the design and cost ( and not diplomacy/political expediency) are given priority would infuse more confidence in people??Even if one sees who threw the first punch, others continued their personal attacks /sarcastic comments page after page, where in almost every other post has sarcastic comments/innuendos about those who question the nuclear accident.

1728,amit,15 Apr 2011 11:47 ,"Putnanja,In the Indian context there is one major difference from the Fukushima incident. And that is the Indian equivalent of TEPCO (and other operators in Japan) is the GoI entity Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. So if it’s not a case of you thinking that the govt is corrupt, then commercial and/or cost considerations are unlikely to come into place regarding reactor designs and such. Also, every piece of reactor part will be inspected and passed by agencies under the Atomic Energy Commission and other govt entities. I don’t think our nuclear experts are so stupid as to not being able to understand whether a particular design is safe or not.I disagree with you on the point that any one on this thread has said that the nuclear incident at Fukushima was insignificant. If you think so, then I must conclude that you either did not read the posts carefully or assumed something that you shouldn’t have. What’s been constantly hammered is that while the accident is serious and there has been significant radiation leakage, the severity was not a doomsday kind of scenario. And more importantly this does not imply that the basic assumption that nuclear is a good source of pollution free high base load power at economical rates is wrong.If you read more than that in the posts – many were admittedly biting – then I will have to question your neutral status in this debate. Similarly is their assumption of max tsunami heights given Japan's previous experience.It would help if you could elaborate on this with some authoritative studies and not just pop science links which claim in the 1800 hundreds there was a 30-40-50 meter high tsunami - I really wonder who was holding the measuring tape for such precise measures and what point on the coastline this ""measurement"" took place. (I do hope you realize the height of a tsunami depends on the topography of the coastline and can vary drastically within a few KM depending on the topology, shallowness or otherwise of the sea facing side etc). Given the corruption endemic in India, and the political game of rewarding all major NSG countries with nuclear parks inspite of delays in their implementations(whether russian or french, or US) or design, I do have my doubts on the safety of these reactors, especially as there will be multiple high capacity reactors in one area. And the destructive nature of nuclear reactors as seen in the japanese accident does raise red flags for me.I’m sorry the bolded portion above makes no sense. Can you name one country outside the NSG grouping that we are negotiating with for reactors (Russia, France and US) who could have given us the technology (GenIII), 1,000 MW plants and fuel?And why do you think it’s a sign of corruption and/or a political game if India rewards the US, Russia and France for helping it to open the NSG door. Would you rather that we got our reactors from China like the Pakis?At the end of the day each and every part of each and every reactor will go through a strict audit by both NPCIL as well as the nuclear authorities before they are selected and installed. I happen to have full confidence in Indian scientists of doing the correct thing. It could be that you don’t have the same confidence. But then that is a state of the mind rather than a factual position unless you can factually prove why you don’t trust them. Maybe an independent nuclear regulator who will go through the design and validate each design before awarding them projects, with the projects themselves being awarded in a transparent manner, say an auction, where in both the design and cost ( and not diplomacy/political expediency) are given priority would infuse more confidence in people??Forgive me but phrases like independent nuclear regulator raises too many NPA flags in my mind. Who would form part of this “independent” body could you tell me? And why precisely do they need to be independent and what would be their expertise to validate each design? Why do you think the GoI and Indian janata need to look for independent “body” for this kind of expertise.And I see that you’ve already convinced yourself that GoI can’t be trusted but presumably “independent” operators are impervious to pressure, inducements and hard sell that folks like GE can and will do. I do understand the limitations of fossil fuel, and the relatively high imports that we face, as also the technological and financial limitations of wind /solar/tidal power projects. It is still a conflict in my mind as to the exact mix of various power projects we need to go for.Boss this is no longer an academic exercise, at least for India. I would suggest you actually read the Stewart Brand interview.Finally Fukushima was victim of a Black Swan even, a biggest ever (since they started measuring in the 1890s) earthquake felt by Japan and globally history’s second largest quake and a killer tsunami.For a typical Indian nuclear park what kind of Black Swan events are you fearful of, that you have this queasiness in your mind. Mind you all Gen III reactors have far more safety features built in, including passive cooling. It’s good to fear but irrational fear is unfounded. For example I have an irrational fear of big dams, I wouldn’t want to live downstream from the Tehri dam. I may survive a nuclear meltdown by getting out of the area within 24 hours of it occurring but I wouldn’t get time to get out of the way from the wall of water which would flow out if the Tehri dam were to burst for any earthquake greater than 8.5 magnitude ( you can search the Indian nook thread to find out why this figure is important). Even if one sees who threw the first punch, others continued their personal attacks /sarcastic comments page after page, where in almost every other post has sarcastic comments/innuendos about those who question the nuclear accident.So you’ve only seen the sarcastic comments of the so-called pro-nuke group and none of the so-called anti-nuclear group? Well that can, in my mind, lead to only to two assumptions. You either haven’t followed this thread and the related Indian nuclear thread carefully as I and many others have; or one needs to reconsider your neutral status.JMT"

In coastal panchayats, median outdoor radiation levels are more than 4 mGy y-1 and, in certain locations on the coast, it is as high as 70 mGy y-1. Although HBR has been repeatedly shown to increase the frequency of chromosome aberrations in the circulating lymphocytes of exposed persons, its carcinogenic effect is still unproven. A cohort of all 385,103 residents in Karunagappally was established in the 1990's to evaluate health effects of HBR. Based on radiation level measurements, a radiation subcohort consisting of 173,067 residents was chosen. Cancer incidence in this subcohort aged 30-84 y (N = 69,958) was analyzed. Cumulative radiation dose for each individual was estimated based on outdoor and indoor dosimetry of each household, taking into account sex- and age-specific house occupancy factors. Following 69,958 residents for 10.5 years on average, 736,586 person-years of observation were accumulated and 1,379 cancer cases including 30 cases of leukemia were identified by the end of 2005. Poisson regression analysis of cohort data, stratified by sex, attained age, follow-up interval, socio-demographic factors and bidi smoking, showed no excess cancer risk from exposure to terrestrial gamma radiation. The excess relative risk of cancer excluding leukemia was estimated to be -0.13 Gy-1 (95% CI: -0.58, 0.46). In site-specific analysis, no cancer site was significantly related to cumulative radiation dose. Leukemia was not significantly related to HBR, either.

According to Kyodo News, workers successfully pumped some 660 tons of water from a trench near the reactor's turbine building to the condenser, part of the internal cooling circuit. The pumping took place on 12 April, and appeared successful, but the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency says that by Thursday evening Japan time, the water level in the trench had increased by about 4.5 centimeters. This is a problem as workers hope to reduce the amount of radioactive water at the plant to a level that will allow them to begin repairs.Elevated levels of radiation in seawater near the plant continue to be reported by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Workers at the plant have installed several barriers of silt and steel in an effort to stem the flow of radiation into the Pacific, but a quick glance at the latest data indicates radiation levels remain well above the legal limit.TEPCO is gaining no friends among the Japanese press. A story from the Financial Times describes how the company's most recent press conference ""angered even jaded Japanese reporters with years of experience of watching dishonoured executives bow deeply and say little"".Meanwhile companies continue to jostle for what will inevitably be a multi-billion-dollar cleanup contract. The Daily Yomiuri reports that Toshiba may ask rival company Hitachi to join its recent bid to clean up the plant in just ten years. (Other experts have their doubts.) A few more details of the Toshiba plan are being reported by the broadcaster NHK. Should Japan Bank Stem Cells From Fukushima Nuclear Workers?http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/should-japan-bank-stem-cells.htmlSeveral Japanese medical experts want to bank blood stem cells from workers at the ailing Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The cells would be used as a treatment in case a high radiation exposure makes a worker sick. But the proposal is raising eyebrows among U.S. experts, who say it probably wouldn't save many lives.In a letter today in The Lancet, Tetsuya Tanimoto of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research and four others note that bringing the radiation-leaking nuclear plant under control could take months or years, and some workers could accidentally be exposed to high levels of radiation. While high radiation doses can eventually cause cancer, the immediate health effect is to destroy dividing cells—including blood cells—which wipes out the immune system. The authors point out that some workers after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster received donated bone marrow transplants, and two Japanese nuclear workers got donated stem cell transplants after a 1999 accident.Stem cell transplant experts in Japan and Europe have endorsed banking the Fukushima workers' stem cells, and medical workers in Japan and in Europe are standing by to help. (The cells would be obtained by giving the workers a drug that nudges blood stem cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, then hooking them to a machine that filters out the stem cells.)Others question the rationale. It's not clear whether donated stem cell transplants helped some Chernobyl workers survive; they received several different types of cells, and there was no control group, says bone marrow transplant expert David Weinstock of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. As for the two Japanese nuclear workers, they eventually died of organ failure caused by radiation anyway, notes radiologist Fred Mettler of the University of New Mexico.On the other hand, giving the Fukushima workers their own stem cells should work better than donor cells because the patients' own cells won't be rejected by the immune system. Experience with lymphoma patients, who receive a transplant of their own blood or bone cells after radiation to wipe out their cancer, has shown ""there's no doubt it helps,"" says bone marrow transplant expert Nelson Chao of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.But a stem cell transplant would help only a worker who received a certain dose—between roughly 5 grays and 10 grays of radiation, Chao says. (Below that, patients survive with other treatments; above it, they would die anyway from damage to the gut and lungs.) The workers would also have had their entire body exposed to radiation. If the workers are partially shielded, like the three who stepped into radioactive water last month, their unaffected bone marrow will replenish the destroyed cells.The number of the 800 or so workers at the Fukushima plant likely to receive radiation in that narrow dose range ""would be pretty limited,"" Chao says. One scenario that might make more sense, Chao says, is if stem cells were banked only for a subset of 100 or so workers who were the only ones sent into high radiation areas.Chao says there a ""lot of e-mails going around"" in response to The Lancet letter, and he expects that a U.S. group that he and Weinstock are part of, the Radiation Injury Treatment Network (RITN), may submit a response. Japan's Nuclear Safety Commission has also opposed the plan because of expert and public disagreements, including a concern that it could give workers false reassurance and make them less careful about taking risks.

1760,abhishek_sharma,16 Apr 2011 07:21 ,"Pools of Danger: Charles D. Fergusonhttp://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ctferguson1/EnglishThe Fukushima Daiichi nuclear crisis in Japan has underscored the dangers of storing highly radioactive spent fuel in pools of water that are susceptible to breaches from natural disasters and hydrogen explosions from accidents. The crisis should serve as a wake-up call for governments and industry to take action to reduce the risks of spent-fuel storage.Unfortunately, spent-fuel storage has been “an afterthought,” as Ernest Moniz, Director of the Energy Initiative at MIT, puts it. In dozens of countries, tens of thousands of tons of highly radioactive material has been kept in buildings that provide little of the usually rigorous protection surrounding radioactive material in reactors’ cores.Pools have become overcrowded in many countries, owing to the lack of permanent repositories for nuclear waste. No country has opened such a repository, although Sweden has made significant progress in doing so.The hazards of pools for spent nuclear fuel have been known for many years, but little action has been taken to alleviate the risks. One notable exception has been Germany. About 25 years ago, the German government began requiring spent fuel to be well protected. The older spent fuel that has cooled for about five years is placed in hardened, dry storage casks, and the younger, more radioactive, and hotter spent fuel is cooled in pools of water surrounded by strong containment structures.These measures cost more money, but they afford much greater protection against accidents, disasters, and terrorist attacks. Is it worth it? A 2003 study, led by Robert Alvarez, a former official at the United States Department of Energy, estimated that a worse-case terrorist attack could drain cooling pools, resulting in spent fuel rods heating up and possibly combusting. That, in turn, would cause substantial amounts of radioactive material to be released if containment structures are breached, potentially resulting in an area of contamination greater than that caused by the Chernobyl accident in 1986.Despite this alarming conclusion, the study did not prompt the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to order utilities to remove spent fuel from overcrowded pools at more than 100 US commercial reactors. It did, however, spur the preparation of a US National Academy of Sciences’ report, which concluded that “successful terrorist attacks on spent fuel pools, though difficult, are possible.”While the report did not recommend placement of older spent fuel into dry storage casks, it did advise the less expensive method of rearranging spent fuel in the pools so that hotter, newly discharged fuel would be surrounded by cooler, older spent fuel. Doing so would likely prevent a fire. The report also called for water-spray systems to fill up draining pools, but made this conditional on a cost-benefit analysis conducted by each plant.Is reprocessing spent fuel the answer? While China, France, India, Japan, and Russia have favored reprocessing in order to recycle plutonium for new fuel, this has not solved the waste problem, because the resulting spent fuel is usually not further recycled. Instead, it is stored in spent-fuel pools.Recycling proponents want ultimately to build a fleet of fast neutron reactors that could consume the plutonium and other fissionable material. But these reactors have experienced safety problems and are more expensive to operate than current reactors. Use of plutonium fuels also increases the risk of nuclear-weapons proliferation.Several decades from now, reprocessing might offer a safe means of spent-fuel disposal. In the interim, the most promising method is to use dry storage casks, which, according to technical studies, provide up to 100 years of safe and secure storage.But industry has expressed concern that each storage cask costs more than $1 million, and that a typical plant’s total costs thus could be tens of millions of dollars. The Alvarez study estimated a cost of $3-5 billion for the entire US reactor fleet, which is the largest in the world.This would be the major one-time cost. After that, the costs would be a few hundred million dollars annually. For comparison, nuclear power in the US generates annual revenues exceeding $30 billion, whereas the cost of a severe accident can easily soar to billions of dollars, as the world is witnessing at Fukushima Daiichi.Industry has also been concerned about minimizing workers’ exposure to radiation when they transfer spent fuel to casks. Moreover, there is a risk of further radiation exposure during the transfer of spent fuel from the casks to permanent storage.To minimize this risk, casks should be developed that can easily be transferred to a secure interim storage facility while permanent repositories receive approval. We should not wait for the next Fukushima Daiichi to act on reducing the risks of spent fuel.Charles D. Ferguson, a physicist and nuclear engineer, is the president of the Federation of American Scientists and the author of the forthcoming book Nuclear Energy: What Everyone Needs to Know. Are larger earthquakes a sign of the times? Seismologists debate whether the recent spate of megaquakes is a statistical fluke or something more.http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110414/full/news.2011.241.htmlBeginning in late 2004, a flurry of massive, tsunami-spawning earthquakes have rocked the world, first slamming Indonesia, then Chile and most recently Japan. Temblors that size are rare indeed: only 7 quakes as large or larger than 8.8 — the magnitude of last February's Chilean event — have occurred since 1900.So what does it mean that three of those seven shocks have happened almost within the span of six years? While some scientists argue that these 'megaquakes' could be the vanguard of an extended outburst of strong seismic events, many others suggest that the apparent cluster of recent temblors is nothing more than a statistical fluke.The recent spate of far-flung quakes is remarkably similar to a cluster that occurred in the middle of the last century, says Charles Bufe, a seismologist retired from the US Geological Survey (USGS) in Denver, Colorado. The seismic events in that supposed grouping, consisting of 3 magnitude 9 or higher temblors, struck Kamchatka, then Chile and then Alaska within a 12-year interval. The odds of quakes that large occurring randomly within such a short time span is only four per cent, Bufe noted today at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America in Memphis, Tennessee.In an update to an analysis first published in June 2005, Bufe and colleague David Perkins, a USGS geophysicist also in Denver, argue that the most recent round of large temblors may mark the beginning of a new global outbreak of megaquakes. According to their model, Bufe says, the probability of another quake of magnitude 9 or larger striking in the next 6 years is about 63 per cent. ""There's now an increased hazard situation for these very large earthquakes,"" he notes.It's an ominous warning considering what scientists are now reporting about the monumental forces behind the 9.0 Tohoku quake, which wreaked devastation on Japan on 11 March. At the meeting, researchers revealed that the main shock ruptured a previously locked seismic interface more than 250 kilometres long and 175 kilometres wide. Although most of the quake's energy was released in the first 2 minutes, several aftershocks — many of them magnitude 6.4 or larger — occurred in the 20 minutes or so that followed. Altogether, that temblor and its aftershocks ruptured areas that had previously slipped in five separate quakes, the researchers say. As a result, the entire northern portion of Honshu, Japan's largest island, moved about 1 meter toward the east, with one site near the temblor's epicentre sliding 5.4 meters horizontally and sinking 1.1 meters — a sudden subsidence that aggravated the damage from the tsunami that slammed the shore minutes later.Yet the apparent clustering of such megaquakes, including the recent Indonesian, Chilean and Japanese events can be accounted for without a direct link, several scientists say. ""When you run statistical tests, you can often get numbers that sound interesting,"" says Richard Aster, a geophysicist at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro. In this case, he suggests, the clumping could come down to the statistics of small sample sizes. Since 1900, there have been only 14 quakes larger than magnitude 8.5. And whereas modern seismology goes back only a little more than a century, the tectonic processes that generate major earthquakes unfold over hundreds or thousands of years, he adds.Looking for patternsIn a separate analysis, Andrew Michael, a seismologist with USGS in Menlo Park, California, scrutinized databases of major quakes for evidence of clustering. Rather than use a single threshold for earthquake magnitude, he ran several statistical analyses using different magnitude thresholds, looking for patterns in quakes over various intervals ranging in length from months to years — and found nothing. ""I've run a large number of tests and can't find any reason to reject the idea that clustering is random,"" he says.That's not to say that major quakes don't stimulate further seismic activity. Barely 4 months after the December 2004 quake struck Indonesia, a magnitude 8.6 temblor occurred just down the coast — the result, scientists say, of the first quake's redistribution of stress in Earth's crust. Usually, the extent of such stress shifts are limited to the immediate region, says Aster. Although there is evidence that the ground motions induced by major temblors trigger small quakes thousands of kilometres away, there's no sign that such triggering occurs for large quakes, he adds.Research published online 27 March in Nature Geoscience bolsters those notions. Tom Parsons, a seismologist also with the USGS in Menlo Park, and colleague Aaron Velasco, of the University of Texas at El Paso, analyzed the USGS earthquake database to see if temblors of magnitude 7 and higher might have triggered midsized quakes elsewhere in the world. Between 1979 and 2009, seismometers recorded 205 quakes with magnitudes above 7, Parsons notes. Although many of those quakes triggered local aftershocks in the day or so after the initial event, Parsons and Velasco found no corresponding increase in the frequency of distant quakes with magnitudes ranging between 5 and 7.The team's analysis also suggests that stress redistribution to nearby faults after a major quake is limited to distances from the epicentre no more than two or three times the length ruptured by the original quake. That, says Parsons, means that even megaquakes shouldn't trigger large quakes more than a couple of thousand kilometres away.  "

For the first time in history, the Japanese government set a limit on radiation in seafood and began screening fish. India and China recently banned imports of food products from certain areas of Japan, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began conducting its own radiation screens on seafood imports.Monitoring food makes sense, according to radiation geochemist William Burnett of Florida State University in Tallahassee, but he warns against overreacting to the perceived risk of ocean contamination. “Stopping eating sushi, that's crazy,” he says, based on what is known about isotope accumulation in marine animals and reports on radiation in the sea near Fukushima. Although radioactive elements could spread quickly through the food chain, Burnett and others say it's unlikely that would lead to a significant risk for humans. What it could mean for ocean-dwelling organisms is another matter—one that scientists are eager to investigate.Many marine species are good at absorbing radioactive isotopes from the water, and experts across the world are beginning to prioritize studies they'd like to do in Japan once the situation stabilizes. “It's another opportunity to study impact on the environment, and many countries will use this opportunity,” says marine radioecologist Bruno Fievet of the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) in Cherbourg. “Probably we will see traces of this accident for many years,” he says.Little is known about the impact of radioactivity on many marine organisms, in part because they are remarkably resistant. Fievet says that a deadly dose of radioactivity for crustaceans and mollusks is orders of magnitude larger than a lethal dose for humans, which makes it dangerous and inefficient for researchers to conduct lab experiments. Harming organisms in the lab, Fievet says, requires levels of radioactivity that are “very, very high compared to what is observed in the marine environment at Fukushima.”The creatures' simple physiology and the salty environment also offer them some protection. Just as potassium iodide tablets can saturate the human thyroid and prevent radioactive iodine from binding, the abundant ocean salts reduce the absorption of radioactive ions by sea creatures.At the same time, Fievet adds, just because there's no immediate hazard is “not a reason not to worry.” Water close to the plant contains particulate radioisotopes, including cesium-137 and iodine-131, which organisms can incorporate into their bodies through their skin or food. Cesium-137 is more worrisome because its 30-year half-life means that it will be around for many decades. The resulting internal dose could induce mutations, stunt growth, and cause reproductive defects. Some organisms are exceptional at taking up isotopes and concentrating them in their bodies. Larger organisms that eat them may receive a high dose of radiation all at once, possibly increasing the risk of harm.In terms of cleaning up the ocean, however, this bioaccumulation could be a boon. Phytoplankton, the base of most marine food chains, can concentrate plutonium a million-fold as it sticks to the surface of their membranes. Larger organisms that eat phytoplankton can't assimilate plutonium, so they excrete it as concentrated fecal matter that sinks to the bottom of the ocean and away from the vast majority of marine life near the surface. Similarly, brown seaweed, a staple of miso soup and sushi bars, acts as an iodine sponge, concentrating the element 10,000-fold compared with the surrounding water. Some researchers have even proposed planting the ocean full of brown seaweed to soak up radioactive iodine, but Fievet says this idea has been more or less rejected because it would simply transfer the problem from water into seaweed.Most researchers believe that in the end the ocean will take care of itself through its vast size. Off the coast of Japan, the sea floor drops quickly, providing a large dilution factor. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports that over a span from the coast to 31 kilometers out, radiation drops 1000-fold. After dilution, says marine biologist Nicholas Fisher of Stony Brook University in New York, added radiation quickly becomes indistinguishable from the natural background level. “The bit introduced by man is a drop in the bucket,” he says.Fievet says that IRSN scientists have begun formulating studies they'd like to undertake with collaborators in Japan. U.S. radioecologists from a number of U.S. universities, the U.S. Department of Energy, and IAEA's Marine Environment Laboratories have also expressed interest in beginning long-term studies. “We are faced with a unique situation” in which an accident is having a direct impact on the sea, says Dominique Boust, director of IRSN's radioecology lab.In the meantime, Fisher says, “While it's nice to know the isotope concentration in water, it's more critical to know what it is in marine organisms.” The National Research Institute of Fisheries Science in Japan has begun screening a number of species and has found elevated cesium-137 in a few fish. Even so, research from weapons testing and the Chernobyl accident found that large fish that accumulate cesium-137 excrete it over time. Compared with other toxins that humans put into the marine environment, researchers conclude, the danger to Japan's fish from the radiation spill is very low. "

Firstly, there is the recycled fuel (not saying where it came from) that has long-lived transuranics in it. You understand -- not the extracted recycles ( which are useful) but the rejected part of the recycles.  These rejected nuclei are encased in a glass ""entombment"" and stashed away (not saying where). Then there is the BWR spent fuel.

Shukla and Nirupam Sen, retired Navy chief L. Ramdas, writers Arundhati Roy and Nayantara Sahgal, scientists M.V. Ramana and P.M. Bhargava, artists Krishen Khanna and Vivan Sundaram, and former vice-chancellors Mushirul Hasan and Deepak Nayyar, have in common?Also a few Brf postors who will brand any body, who as much as question their  point of view,  as anti-indian?he answer is, concern about the safety of nuclear power, highlighted by the still-unfolding disaster at Fukushima in Japan. This impelled these eminent individuals to sign a statement demanding a thorough, independent review of India's nuclear power programme, and pending it, a moratorium on further nuclear projects.The statement (available at cndpindia.org, sacw.net) saw people of different ideological persuasion coming together, including former Atomic Energy Regulatory Board Chairman A. Gopalakrishnan and Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament and Peace activists (including myself). Even Indian Institute of Science (Bangalore) director Prof. P. Balaram signed up, a rare thing for a top scientist to do.This appeal comes just as two workers at Fukushima have died. {Described as dead men walking, perhaps?}  Nuclear power zealots had predicted that the accidents wouldn't harm plant employees, leave alone the public.  {Not only that, they have dined the postors here with 1000 mSv dose, perhaps, according to one } Fukushima's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), admits that three other employees have suffered severe (?  ? ) radiation burns {   all that with some radiation dose!!}   and many others have been exposed to radiation. The public is at risk. Radionuclides have contaminated milk, vegetables and fish in Fukushima and nearby. {And 100,0000,000,000 have died in Cashemer alone } Radiation levels at the plant are 1,000 millisieverts an hour {  }, whereas the highest annual permissible dose for employees is 30 millisieverts. { I am sure, these guys also think that Bq is a banana from Uranus}  Water and steam have been released, containing iodine-131, caesium-137 and strontium-90. These have been detected thousands of kilometres away. { And cosmic rays  billions of light years can be detected here on earth }Iodine-31 concentrates in the thyroid, caesium-137 in many other tissues, and strontium-90 in bones.Fukushima's health damage will be revealed not through early deaths, but through slow, virtually endless low-radiation exposure, which produces cancers. Thanks to early evacuation, the Fukushima death-toll won't be as high as Chernobyl's (estimated at 34,000 to 70,000 deaths). { Not 985,000?    - lower number estimated is less than 100, BTW by some} However, the reactors contain 40 times the caesium inventory of Chernobyl. If only a tenth of this is released, its impact would be four times greater than Chernobyl's. {We know math!!  }According to estimates {of course, estimated by XXXX}  based on data from a UN agency, Fukushima has already released iodine-131 equal to 20% of that released from Chernobyl and half as much caesium-137. { Really ??}Fukushima happened not because of the earthquake and tsunami, but because these triggered mishaps in reactors already vulnerable to catastrophic accidents. All reactor designs can undergo core meltdowns. {described by  some here as  ""almost virgin""}   Natural calamities only make these more likely.Fukushima's reactors weren't designed for high-magnitude earthquakes and tsunamis. Their primary containment, the vessel holding the reactor, was weak.Besides, spent fuel was stored in the reactor building. Unlike reactors, spent-fuel pools don't have reinforced structures. The roof of Reactor 4 spent-fuel pool was blown off. The spent-fuel got heated and the water boiled off, releasing radioactivity. India's Tarapur reactors have the same spent-fuel storage design.The Fukushima crisis still remains uncontrolled. Three reactors suffered a partial core meltdown, one to the extent of 70%. Four of the six reactors, poisoned by seawater, must be scrapped.The immediate challenge is to keep the reactors cool and seal the cracks that water is leaking through. TEPCO claims its sealing efforts have finally succeeded. How reliable the seals are remains to be seen.Seawater radiation levels near Fukushima were millions of times higher than permissible. If the Fukushima staff is evacuated, the reactors could undergo a full meltdown...... Its denials are unconvincing.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has ordered a thorough review of India's nuclear installations, especially on their capacity to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis. But Nuclear Power Corporation Chairman S.K. Jain boasts: ""We have got total knowledge and design of the seismic activities"" and DAE reactors are planned for ""[the] worst seismic activities and tsunamis.""However, Dr. Singh said  ....This was a slap in the face of the DAE, now the laughing-stock of the global scientific community.....

They would involve heat exchangers and circulation pumps to drain reactor coolant water from the containment buildings, cooling it with seawater and then sending it back to the reactors, the sources said.TEPCO appears to have already placed orders for dozens of gasketed plate heat exchangers -- each measuring 3 meters high, 1 meter wide and 2 meters long -- for such systems, the sources said."

Traveling on miniature tank-like treads, the devices opened closed doors and explored the insides of the reactor buildings, coming back with radioactivity readings of up to 49 millisieverts per hour inside Unit 1 and up to 57 millisieverts per hour inside Unit 3. The legal limit for nuclear workers was more than doubled since the crisis began to 250 millisieverts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends an evacuation after an incident releases 10 millisieverts of radiation, and workers in the U.S. nuclear industry are allowed an upper limit of 50 millisieverts per year. Doctors say radiation sickness sets in at 1,000 millisieverts and includes nausea and vomiting. Another example of legal limits being arbitrarily jigged because the current limits would be just unworkable.It remains to be seen what will be the final impact of letting people be exposed to radiation far outside the older permitted limits."

He said the highest level of radiation recorded near the nuclear power station was 1,204.2 microsieverts per hour at 8:33 AM.Edano said this was probably because the air inside the reactor's containment vessel is being discharged in an attempt to decrease the pressure.Sunday, March 13, 2011 14:32 +0900 (JST)This would certainly account for higher radiation and findings of  isotopes of cesium and reportedly strontium."
1806,chaanakya,18 Apr 2011 18:46 ,"Robots detect high levels of radiationRemote-controlled robots have detected high levels of radiation inside the reactor buildings at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.The plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, on Monday released radiation data and photos taken by the US-made robots. The company conducted the survey using the robots on Sunday and Monday.This is the first time the situation inside the buildings has been made public since the March 11th disaster triggered a series of nuclear accidents. Workers have been unable to approach the buildings due to high radiation levels.TEPCO said the robots surveyed the first floor of the No.1 reactor for about 50 minutes and detected maximum radiation readings of 49 millisieverts per hour.A person staying in such an environment for 5 hours would be exposed to 250 millisierverts of radiation -- the legal limit for nuclear workers in emergency situations.The survey inside the No. 3 reactor lasted for about 2 hours, but the plant operator says the robots had difficulty moving around because of the debris. The maximum radiation reading was 57 millisieverts per hour.The power company says it hopes to find locations where workers can go to carry out decontamination tasks so it can implement its schedule for bringing the troubled plant under control.On Sunday, the utility presented a schedule for cooling down the reactors and significantly reducing radiation leaks within 6 to 9 months.Monday, April 18, 2011 18:58 +0900 (JST)Well apart from High radiation at the plant premises hampering the cooling efforts and other containment works,  TEPCO is in for a long haul of  6-9 months only for cooling the reactor and bringing down radiation level to significantly (?) lower level."

To prevent overflow, TEPCO is stepping up the inspection of the nuclear waste processing facility, to which it aims to transfer contaminated water.Underground water at the plant is also contaminated.On Wednesday, the level of radioactive substances sharply increased at facilities where underground water from the Number 1 and 2 reactors is collected.On Friday, workers kept on monitoring the situation.They say the level of radioactive substances has stabilized or decreased in every reactor from 1 to 6.So they say it's unlikely that highly radioactive water is still seeping into underground water.Monday, April 18, 2011 08:44 +0900 (JST)This explains the need for using robots to monitor radiation levels."

Commenting on the reason for their delayed arrival, a representative of the commission's secretariat explained that the commission had been busy following up inquiries from the government's disaster countermeasures headquarters and related government agencies.Deputy Fukushima Gov. Masao Uchibori reported the members' arrival at a meeting of the prefecture's main office for disaster countermeasures on the evening of April 17.""I talked with members for the first time on the 38th day from the day of the earthquake disaster. I told them to go to local areas, listen to victims and respond appropriately,"" he said.Commission members, who were dispatched as specialists providing emergency technological advice to the government's local headquarters for nuclear disaster countermeasures, did not attend the meeting of the prefecture's main office for disaster countermeasures or meet with Fukushima Gov.

1810,chaanakya,18 Apr 2011 19:09 ,"Experts doubt TEPCO's timetable for bringing nuke plant under controlExperts have called into question the feasibility of the controversial timetable unveiled by the Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) for bringing its crippled Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant under control.""I got the impression that the plan is only a nonbinding target. I fear it will be fairly difficult to achieve the plan as nuclear reactors and other equipment have not been brought under full control yet,"" said Hidekazu Yoshikawa, professor emeritus at Kyoto University, who specializes in nuclear reactor engineering.Kyushu University professor Kazuhiko Kudo is also skeptical about the viability of TEPCO's plan announced on April 17, which is aimed at making the reactors stable -- a process called a ""cold shutdown"" -- within six to nine months, with a ""step one"" period eyeing a steady decline in the radiation leakage dose within the next three months.""The 'three-month' target is a best possible scenario, and whether it can be achieved or not depends on how much water the utility can prevent from leaking from the pressure vessels and the containment vessels. It is imperative to install an external system to recycle cooling water as soon as possible,"" Kudo said.It has been pointed out that water leakages, due possibly to damage to the pressure vessels and the containment vessels, may be helping to stop water levels in the No. 1, 2 and 3 reactors from rising as much as expected. This is despite the continued water injection to cool down the reactors, which is preventing TEPCO from embarking on substantial work to achieve a cold shutdown. It is feared the fuel rods in the spent nuclear fuel pool in the No. 4 reactor have also been damaged.""While the sources of the water leaks must be located as quickly as possible, more urgent work needs to be done because the radiation doses at the facility are extremely high,"" said Takashi Sawada, vice chairman of the Atomic Energy Society of Japan.To bring about a cold shutdown within nine months, TEPCO's roadmap presumes that the pressure vessels of the No. 1, 2 and 3 reactors are sound and that the containment vessels other than that of the No. 2 reactor are all free of damage.""These presumptions are in themselves ridiculous as they haven't been confirmed as facts. The plan is nothing but pie in the sky,"" lambasted Keiji Kobayashi, former instructor at Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute.Furthermore, attempts to bring the crippled plant under control have been repeatedly suspended due to a spate of aftershocks affecting the region, prompting another expert to fear that a massive tsunami triggered by a possible ocean-trench earthquake could further delay restoration work.""The plant could be hit by a massive tsunami topping several meters in height. Restoration work needs to proceed while taking heed of preventing a secondary disaster from happening,"" said Takashi Furumura, professor of seismology at the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute.(Mainichi Japan) April 18, 2011"
1811,chaanakya,18 Apr 2011 19:25 ,"A piece of news I would have missed during last four days absence is that Govt of Japan perhaps ( not yet confirmed) is planning to dismantle TEPCO. This was before TEPCO cam out with a nine month plan for achieving cold shut down of the reactor. and EDANO announced that some of the evacuees may return to FUKUSHIMA in six month's time.This is interesting because it points to the possibility of power struggle and TEPCO's stranglehold on political and bureaucratic class and division among them. This nexus could have lead to TEPCO bypassing many safety related features and embark on cost cutting measures by resortin g to dubious engineering practices , pointed out in various postings and  commented also by Theo. Others might have chosen to ignore that as it proves culpability of TEPCO in this crisis. In fact many other plants have survived due to enhanced measures of safety implemented as a result of revision of quake and tsunami  related guidelines bu GOJ in 2006.Government considering plan to dismantle TEPCOSince it is claimed to be secret plan its authenticity is not confirmed.A secret plan to dismantle Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), the operator of the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, is circulating within the government.The proposal, which is associated with a faction of bureaucrats who have long supported liberalization of Japan's power industry, envisages the passing of a special measures law that would put the company under close government supervision before eventually bankrupting it and completely restructuring its remnants.There are also proposals to smash the company's powerful influence on politicians and the mass media and force executives to give all their pay and severance settlements to victims of the earthquake.However, a rival faction in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) and politicians with links to the power industry may try to fight or emasculate the radical proposals.Sources said internal government discussions about how to handle TEPCO began in earnest around March 28, as it became clear that trillions of yen would be required just to compensate residents of Fukushima Prefecture affected by the nuclear disaster. The plan to dismantle the firm was being circulated by the end of the month.At its center is a special measures bill placing TEPCO under government supervision and paving the way to pulling it apart.A former ANRE official who supports the plan said: ""The special measures law will be necessary when we consider the need for comprehensive reform of TEPCO's management, including the establishment of a third-party organ to certify compensation decisions, a way to come up with the funds to pay compensation, and the separation of the company's nuclear energy department.""According to an outline draft proposal, there would be four main measures within the bill.An independent committee would be established within the government to oversee TEPCO's management. It would monitor the selection of executives, the compensation process and management reform.The law would allow the government to guarantee all loans from financial institutions needed to pay for the disaster response at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.Business transactions, such as payments for fuel, would also be protected.Finally, the law would put a moratorium on the repayment of debt, including corporate bonds, from before the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.A key issue in handling the issue will be timing. If the government uses public funds to save the company before the compensation to be paid out is decided, the burden on the public is likely to be increased.Even if the central government injects capital into TEPCO in exchange for preferred stock, that stock would have a subordinate claim to the assets of the company compared with debt held by financial institutions and corporate bonds. Its claims would be the first to be pushed aside in bankruptcy proceedings.A government official said it would be folly to ""inject fresh water into polluted water, because that water would end up becoming polluted as well.""Instead, supporters of the restructuring plan want to keep TEPCO in its current form in the short term and use government guarantees to keep it running.Those guarantees would not extend to financial claims dating from before the finalization of the government bailout plan, including approximately 2 trillion yen ($23.6 billion) in emergency loans recently extended by major financial institutions.A government source said those loans had been ""something the private sector did based on its own risk assessments.""The plan expects bankruptcy proceedings to begin once the amount of compensation is settled and the total cost of handling the Fukushima accident can be estimated.According to the company's financial statements for the fiscal year ending in March 2010, TEPCO had 13.2 trillion yen in assets and 10.6 trillion yen in liabilities. If compensation exceeds the difference between those amounts, TEPCO would have excess liabilities. Some estimates put the cost of compensation and handling the Fukushima accident at approximately 10 trillion yen, meaning TEPCO is already effectively bankrupt.The plan envisages a drastic restructuring of TEPCO during the bankruptcy and rehabilitation process.During the bankruptcy proceedings, a financial dissolution plan would be compiled after most of the debt was finalized. That plan would likely include eliminating all the company's capital and asking financial institutions to forgive debt.To lessen the impact on the corporate bond market, the discounting of bonds would likely be less severe than the writing off of debt from financial institutions.The biggest issue at the rehabilitation stage is likely to be a proposal supported by some METI officials to separate the power generation and power transmission arms of TEPCO.When Britain privatized its electricity generation industry, it was separated into two distinct sectors: companies handling power generation and firms responsible for power transmission. The aim was to keep down the price of electricity by encouraging competition in the industry.In Japan, all nine electric power companies handle both power generation and transmission, and they have been fighting the idea of separating the two functions for years.Under the plan, TEPCO would first be made a holding company and subsidiaries would be established to separately handle power generation and power transmission. Conventional thermal and hydro power plants owned by the power generating arm would be gradually sold off to new entrants to the market. Selling off plants and profitable subsidiaries would lessen the financial burden on the public.Eventually, TEPCO would end up as a power transmission company on a far smaller scale than it is at present.Sources said separation into power generation and transmission companies would probably happen two or three years after passage of the special measures law.There are also proposals for a ban on political donations by TEPCO and its labor union. The power industry is known for its strong political connections, with key backers including Lower House member Akira Amari and other Liberal Democratic Party members, who make up the commerce lobby, and Upper House Democratic Party of Japan member Masashi Fujiwara, who has roots in the Federation of Electric Power Related Industry Worker's Unions.Another issue that may be addressed is TEPCO's influence over the mass media, maintained using a huge advertising budget, which was used to foster the widespread belief that nuclear plants did not pose a safety risk.There are also proposals to force all TEPCO executives to donate all of their remuneration and severance pay to victims of the nuclear accident, to cut corporate adviser posts, and to prevent retiring executives from getting jobs at related companies, a practice known as ""amakudari.""The fate of the plans may partly rely on bureaucratic politics, and, specifically, the relative influence of two rival bureaucratic factions within METI and ANRE.Around 2004, when Katsusada Hirose and Seiji Murata were METI vice ministers, a group arguing for liberalization of the electric power industry was in the ascendancy. But bureaucrats defending the status quo, under the patronage of Hideji Sugiyama and Takao Kitabata, who later served as vice ministers, have made a comeback and now hold a number of important ministry posts. The plan to dismantle TEPCO is associated with the liberalizing group.One high-ranking ANRE official emphasized that the plan had not yet been authorized, and a mid-level METI bureaucrat said, ""It is only being talked about by those in the Prime Minister's Official Residence and the National Policy Unit.""There is a strong possibility that the plan will be watered down by politicians in the Diet or emasculated by officials in METI and ANRE, which has been chosen as the lead agency overseeing the future of TEPCO.Only future action would tell if such a plan was ever conceived."
1812,chaanakya,18 Apr 2011 19:28 ,"Tsunami hit more than 100 designated evacuation sitesKYODOMore than 100 evacuation sites designated by local governments were swept away or inundated by the tsunami triggered by the March 11 earthquake just off the Tohoku region's coast, according to a tally compiled by Kyodo News.Many people are thought to have lost their lives after fleeing to those sites, believing they would be safe, but no data have so far been collected on the death toll at those places.There have been no moves so far among citizens to hold local governments responsible for designating those sites, apparently because the scale of the tsunami was beyond what had been foreseen.But calls will likely grow for a review of locations of evacuation sites along coastal regions. Municipalities throughout the country had picked around 70,000 such sites as of April 1, 2008, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.At least 101 designated sites were hit by the disaster in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima, the three Pacific coast prefectures struck hardest by the gigantic waves after the quake, according to the tally.Local governments in Fukushima Prefecture have not been able to grasp the extent of damage because the ongoing crisis at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant has made it difficult to conduct research in the area around the plant. The sum of tsunami-hit evacuation sites may well thus rise further.In Minamisanriku, Miyagi Prefecture, for instance, 31 of its 80 designated sites were hit. ""Most of them were washed away,"" said an official.In the same prefecture, Onagawa's 25 sites were set up at locations at least 6 meters above sea level, a lesson the town learned from the major tsunami that reached the region after the 1960 Chile quake. The March 11 tsunami, however, smashed 12 of the 25 sites.In Iwate Prefecture, the city of Kamaishi had four of its 69 sites damaged and the city of Ofunato six of its 58 sites. In the town of Yamada, public buildings were wiped out by the tsunami and fires, leaving at least a dozen people missing.Local governments designate sites for evacuation from tsunami and quakes. Many are public structures such as elementary and junior high schools or local assembly buildings, as well as shrines and temples. Some are upland parks or vacant land lots.In Otsuchi, Iwate Prefecture, Koganji Temple, located just under 1 km from the shore, was a designated evacuation site. The temple survived the big tsunami of 1896 and had held a disaster preparedness drill just one week before the March 11 tsunami.On March 11, neighbors gathered after a tsunami warning was issued. Deputy chief priest Ryokan Ogayu, 52, and his wife, Tomoko, directed people to move farther upland at the temple entrance gate but the temple was soon swallowed by waves.The couple were eventually rescued but their 19-year-old son, Hiroumi, and Tomoko's father-in-law and chief priest, Hideaki, 82, who were with the couple before the tsunami, are missing. There were also 30 others within the temple's premises, she said. The temple was later hit also by a fire.""We thought it was safe,"" said Tomoko, adding that it should be studied why it came to be designated as an evacuation site. If standards for selecting sites no longer fit the reality, they should be revised, she said."

1818,chaanakya,18 Apr 2011 20:12 ,"Radioactive sand causes mutations in human DNAThe study was carried out among residents of Kerala, a densely populated area at the southern tip of India, where thousands of traditional fishing families have lived for generations. The residents are exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average.The glistening black sand on the beaches contains radioactive materials such as thorium and monazite. Kerala has the world's highest level of natural radioactivity in a densely populated area, according to the researchers. The radioactive strip measures an area of ten kilometers by one kilometer.""Our family study encompasses several generations per family, and therefore we saw what was really happening with the new mutations,"" says Peter Forster, a molecular geneticist at the McDonald Institute, University of Cambridge, U.K.Forster and his team studied 988 individuals of 248 families that have been exposed to high and low levels of natural radiation throughout their lives, including five families with four generations. Residents from nearby low-radiation islands served as a control population.High-radiation and low-radiation localities sampled in this study. Radioactive areas are identifiable by the presence of black monazite sand, rather than the white nonradioactive sand elsewhere.For two years, Lucy Forster, of the University of Münster, Germany, and others on the team collected DNA samples in Kerala and analyzed them in the lab.The researchers looked at the DNA from mitochondria, the tiny energy producers of human cells that live outside the nucleus and have their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother and can be used to determine whether a mutation is passed on from the mother to her descendents.The scientists identified 22 mutations in the mitochondrial DNA sequences of families living in the high-radiation area. By comparison, a control population living on white sand nearby only had one mutation.Interestingly, these mutations were located at positions the researchers refer to as ""evolutionary hot spots,"" which mutate much faster than other positions during evolution, according to the findings published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The research doesn't necessarily suggest a link between the 22 mutations and disease. ""We intentionally analyzed a non-coding region of the DNA where mutations have no effect on health or on any other visible features,"" says Forster.The new findings may have implications for current radiation standards. ""It might be worth considering whether to lower the allowed limits for radiation workers of reproductive age,"" says Forster. The maximum allowed for workers exposed to radiation (in research or in nuclear facilities) is 50 times higher than normal.Previous studies indicate that there is no conclusive evidence that people living in places with natural radioactivity are at a higher risk for cancer and other health-related problems.There are similar natural radiation areas in southern China, Iran and Brazil, but the Kerala coast in southern India is believed to be the only high-radioactivity region with a high population density.There are studies which point to various conclusions some opposing each other.  It would be foolish to dismiss one or the other without further research and if and when a consensus is arrived at among the scientists and experts' community. Layman is bound to get conflicting ideas. Afterall we all know the blind experts describing elephant in the room."

In coastal panchayats, median outdoor radiation levels are more than 4 mGy y-1 and, in certain locations on the coast, it is as high as 70 mGy y-1. Although HBR has been repeatedly shown to increase the frequency of chromosome aberrations in the circulating lymphocytes of exposed persons, its carcinogenic effect is still unproven. A cohort of all 385,103 residents in Karunagappally was established in the 1990's to evaluate health effects of HBR. Based on radiation level measurements, a radiation subcohort consisting of 173,067 residents was chosen. Cancer incidence in this subcohort aged 30-84 y (N = 69,958) was analyzed. Cumulative radiation dose for each individual was estimated based on outdoor and indoor dosimetry of each household, taking into account sex- and age-specific house occupancy factors. Following 69,958 residents for 10.5 years on average, 736,586 person-years of observation were accumulated and 1,379 cancer cases including 30 cases of leukemia were identified by the end of 2005. Poisson regression analysis of cohort data, stratified by sex, attained age, follow-up interval, socio-demographic factors and bidi smoking, showed no excess cancer risk from exposure to terrestrial gamma radiation. The excess relative risk of cancer excluding leukemia was estimated to be -0.13 Gy-1 (95% CI: -0.58, 0.46). In site-specific analysis, no cancer site was significantly related to cumulative radiation dose. Leukemia was not significantly related to HBR, either. Although the statistical power of the study might not be adequate due to the low dose, our cancer incidence study, together with previously reported cancer mortality studies in the HBR area of Yangjiang, China, suggests it is unlikely that estimates of risk at low doses are substantially greater than currently believed.PMID: 19066487 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]Link:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19066487LinkSeveral studies have attempted to assess the health effects of the extra terrestrial radiation present in Kerala, India. The people who live in this region are exposed to much higher levels or terrestrial radiation than people living just about anywhere else in the world.One particular research study involved over 100,000 inhabitants living in or near Kerala. These people were interviewed about their lifestyle, occupation, housing, tobacco and alcohol use. Statistics were also performed on the incidences of cancer. A comparison between people in the highest radiation zones and those in lower, normal areas indicated there was no increase in the incidence of cancer in the people who lived in areas with more radiation.A similar study monitored the health of newborns in Kerala. Again the scientists found no correlation between a higher incidence of cancer and the higher doses of radiation.Since radiation causes cancer shouldn't people living in regions where they are exposed to higher levels of radiation have a higher incidence of cancer? The correlation seems to fit, { At comparatively  higher background rates the correlation seems to fit better as I have posted multiple times citing studies}  but the results of the Kerala studies prove otherwise. Is it possible that the people of Kerala have some sort of cancer protective gene or genes? Future studies are aimed at determining whether this may be a possibility."

You can mention it as much as you like I don't think it affects me a bit, but does it help in the topic going forward as of now?To be sure I have  objections to BED in the sense that it unconsciously leads to the inference that since banana is good therefore radiation is good and also the more banana the more goodness and in similar vein the more radiation the more goodness it accrues. Such a inference would neither be implied nor intended nor appropriate. It is like selling car by showing beautiful models. What models have to do with selling of car? But its the way sales works. That psychology is sought to be exploited here.  Why not find some other neutral alternative .Anyway I never meant to insult or mock you/others  unless it is intended by others first. One can say same point in without taking potshots as Vina and GP are accustomed to , as evidenced in many threads. In fact if you see my previous ( initial posts) I had requested mods to move nuclear related posts to septate thread as I knew  it needed separate treatment lest tsunami/quake related news got sidelined."

1827,chaanakya,18 Apr 2011 21:08 ,"Gov't under fire for disaster response; TEPCO chief heckled in DietMonday 18th April, 12:15 PM JST TOKYO —A blueprint for ending radiation leaks and stabilizing reactors at Japan’s crippled nuclear plant drew a lackluster response Monday, as polls showed diminishing public support for the government’s handling of the country’s recent disasters.The plan issued by Tokyo Electric Power Co over the weekend, in response to a government order, is meant to be a first step toward letting some of the tens of thousands of evacuees from near the company’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant return to their homes.Those forced to flee due to radiation leaks after a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami on March 11 knocked out the plant’s power and cooling systems are frustrated that their exile will not end soon. And officials acknowledge that unforeseen complications, or even another natural disaster, could set that timetable back even further.“Well, this year is lost,” said Kenji Matsueda, 49, who is living in an evacuation center in Fukushima after being forced from his home 20 kilometers from the plant. “I have no idea what I will do. Nine months is a long time. And it could be longer. I don’t think they really know.”Pressure has been building on the government and TEPCO to resolve Japan’s worst-ever nuclear power accident, and Prime Minister Naoto Kan is facing calls for his resignation.“You should be bowing your head in apology. You clearly have no leadership at all,” Masashi Waki, a lawmaker from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, shouted during an intense grilling of Kan and members of his cabinet in parliament Monday.“I am sincerely apologizing for what has happened,” Kan said, stressing that the government was doing all it could to handle unprecedented disasters.TEPCO’s president, Masataka Shimizu, looked visibly ill at ease as lawmakers heckled and taunted him.“I again deeply apologize for causing so much trouble for residents near the complex, people in Fukushima and the public,” Shimizu said.Meanwhile, polls by several Japanese national newspapers released Monday showed widespread dissatisfaction with TEPCO’s plan and how Kan’s administration has dealt with the nuclear crisis.“Nothing concrete,” said a headline in the Mainichi newspaper of the plan. “The nuclear timetable does not show enough consideration for the residents,” said the Nihon Keizai, a financial newspaper.A majority of those surveyed in the polls by the Mainichi, Nihon Keizai and Asahi newspapers expressed support, though, for tax increases to pay for reconstruction of areas devastated by the tsunami.Goshi Hosono, an adviser to the prime minister and member of his nuclear crisis management task force, said the government would closely monitor TEPCO’s implementation of its crisis plan and hoped it could be carried out ahead of schedule.The timetable’s first step focuses on cooling the reactors and spent fuel pools, reducing radiation leaks and decontaminating water that has become radioactive, within three months. The second step, for within six to nine months, is to bring the release of radioactive materials fully under control, achieve a cold shutdown of the reactors and cover the buildings, possibly with a form of industrial cloth.Nuclear safety officials described the plan as “realistic,” but acknowledged there could be setbacks.“Given the conditions now, this is best that it could do,” said Hidehiko Nishiyama of the government’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, adding that conditions at the facility remain unstable.Explosions, fires and other malfunctions have hindered efforts to repair the stricken plant and stem radiation leaks.“There is no shortcut to resolving these issues. Though it will be difficult, we have to go step by step to resolve these problems,” he said.Even with the announcement of the timeline, it remained unclear when evacuees might be able to return home.The area would need to be decontaminated, including removing and replacing the soil, Nishiyama said.Hosono said the evacuees would not have to stay in gymnasiums for such a long period, but would be moved into temporary housing.Some evacuees were unswayed by TEPCO’s plan.“I don’t believe a word they say,” said Yukio Otsuka, 56, a private school owner whose home is about three miles (five kilometers) from the power plant. “I don’t trust them. I don’t believe it is possible. We have really drawn the short stick on this one.”Activists criticized the delay in the roadmap’s announcement.“TEPCO has taken far too long to provide an indication of the direction it plans to take to bring the situation at Fukushima Dai-ichi under control,” said Philip White of the Tokyo-based Citizens’ Nuclear Information Center, a group of scientists and activists who have opposed nuclear power since 1975. “We hope TEPCO meets its targets, but there are many challenges ahead and many uncertainties.”The unveiling of the roadmap came two days after TEPCO - also under pressure from Kan’s government - announced plans to give 1 million yen in initial compensation to each evacuated household, with much more expected later."

Few points, I may add:1) You have right to your own opinion, and that can be respected but not your own facts.2) With all due respect, it might be helpful to understand basic fundamentals of statistics to understand what ""no correlation"" means. Particularly in this case, statistical analysis shows no validity of LNT hypothesis. As to : I am sure there are many studies pointing in both directions and unless consensus is achieved, the matter would remain inconclusive.If you are sure, why not cite a SINGLE reputable study instead of opinion pieces of what one may think. The people are living in Kerala (not to mention in Colorado, Idaho, Iran) for centuries. So there is no lack of sample data. The key point here is be quantitative. In US for example, cancer rate varies from state to state from 16% to 24% and it would have been easy to find correlation if LNT method indeed had some validity. The studies mentioned before had 100,000+ sample size for Kerala.. and there have been *many* studies, all leading to essentially the same point. I don't think Praful Bidwai will ever be convinced. He or you, for that matter, certainly entitled to hold any idea you wish. Others on the other hand, are also entitled to hold any opinion on their idea, they wish.Over and out.. on this point.P.S. We are not talking about some one saying ""radiation causes mutation"" as a study, what I am looking for is a clear cut study showing the relationship between low doses of radiation and  demonstrable/objective  health effects."

How does this compare with the deuteron fluxin a 100-muamp cyclotron beam (say of IIT mumbai) that covers an area of 1.0 cm^2.You will agree, that answer to this is hazar times easier than any heat-transfer or Rankine Cyle feasibility study... see if the neutron flux will be a problem or not.I will wait for your answer. If you want to suggest a solution, will not at least a basic  understanding of science is needed to test if the solution will work? Now, let us see, you are talking heat-transfer so at least you must have worked out how much heat is generated by spent fuel. The decay heat depends, obviously upon amount of fission products.  Will you be able to put a answer to Q1 I asked in the other thread.Of course, it up to you to answer. I am just curious what your answer will be."

Some may be my guesses but most, I think, are consistent with what the experts are saying. 1. As said before (actually right in the beginning - see my posts then) It is a long term process. Chernobyl burqa took something like 8 months. Radiation has to subside, calculation have to be made, plans have to be checked and double checked etc.2. Full (as much as full can be called) will take about 10-20 years. (See my post in the beginning again, or MITNSE type sites). This is the time frame to treat all the water , move all Cs, fuel rods, eent-pathar out, clean up soil etc, and burry it all. Expensive process, but nothing unexpected, even scheduled retiring  of NPP, one has to do that.3. 3 Months period -  hope fully (actually there are positive indications that the time frame is ok)  cooling pumps etc are restored, and normal ""cold shutdown"" condition is reached. 4. By this time, the decay heat would have fallen enough (according to best available data) and stable condition would have reached. This means - water temp would be below 100C with normal/stable cooling.5. At this time, perhaps, containers would be examined and any leaks would be  sealed to keep the inside inside. Next 5-6 months all reactors may be flooded in water by erecting swimming pool type walls or make the whole part an artificial lake  (There are some concerns, - earth-quakes related - to make sure the walls would be okay). - This is perhaps better deal than concrete burqa. 6. Radiation level will be closely monitored. Things will settle down in next 3 months or so. 7. Iodine half life is small, so 3 months will reduce the quantity by a factor or 1000x. Cs has relatively short biological half life (month or so) so food etc would be monitored. Soil may need to be cleaned up etc. But this can be done at its own pace.... Just some points...Take it for whatever it's worth "

The bottom line is that rates in some places at least are far too high for human workers to enter the plant. The readings point to a long and difficult clean up process. You can read more about what the numbers mean here.Over the weekend, remote-controlled robots entered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The robots took the first photos inside the units 1 and 3 reactors (right) and assessed radiation levels. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which runs the plant, sent Packbots, from the American company iRobot.Packbots are used for explosive ordinance disposal in Iraq and Afghanistan, but in the wake of the nuclear accident iRobot sent two to Fukushima, along with two larger Warrior bots. The robots are equipped with cameras and radiation detector equipment, and are even capable of opening doors (presuming they're not locked). Normally the robots are radio-controlled, but iRobot installed a fiber-optic link on the models at Fukushima, to make it easier to operate them in the harsh radiation environment that is believed to exist inside the plant.Click here for more on the role of robots at Fukushima. TEPCO sets out Fukushima crisis plan - April 18, 2011http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2011/04/fukushima_crisis_gets_a_flowch.htmlEver since a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on 11 March, activities at the site have been hasty, improvised, and often uncoordinated. For engineers, project managers (and reporters who cover large projects), nothing has made the chaos more pronounced than the lack of a flowchart. Yesterday that all changed: the world now has a brightly coloured chart of the next six to nine months at Fukushima.Flowcharts are omnipresent in the world of big projects. They impose order on the myriad little tasks needed to complete a spacecraft or particle accelerator. They ensure that the hundreds or thousands of people involved have a clear view of the goal, and where their own efforts fit in. They're often derided, but as a reporter, I find them invaluable.For the first month, Fukushima had no public flowchart. Instead, workers seemed to be pursuing an ad hoc strategy of flooding reactors and pumping out contaminated water. That made sense in the short term, but bringing the reactors under control is a mammoth task that will require careful planning and coordination. A flowchart is long overdue.The new plan from the owner of the plant, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), reflects the complex task ahead. It can be roughly broken down into three parts:First, workers will continue to cool the reactors, whose nuclear fuel is still generating significant amounts of heat. In the near term, the cooling will be done as it is now, with water pumped in through the Emergency Core Cooling system. But in the long term, TEPCO would like to restore a ""heat exchange function"", which I take to mean they would like to have some system for re-circulating water through the core. This would avoid the massive build-up of contaminated water that has been a problem at the site for the past few weeks.Second, but in parallel with the cooling effort, is a plan to deal with contamination on the site. The most pressing problem is the thousands of tons of radioactive water building up as a result of emergency cooling. Here, the utility seems to be taking a two-pronged approach. For lightly contaminated water the plan is to decontaminate it, possibly with zeolite filters of the sort we've discussed elsewhere. Higher level water will be stored in new tanks and other waste facilities at the site.TEPCO is also planning to build a structure or structures over the reactors, which will keep radiation in, and hopefully keep rain and wind out. These structures will initially be flimsy, but the company plans to design more substantial concrete buildings to cover the reactors. Finally, TEPCO is planning a coordinated monitoring system that will allow local residents to accurately gauge the risk they face as they begin to return to the evacuation zone.The entire plan should, theoretically, be completed in six to nine months. It's an ambitious schedule, but if it were successful, it would bring a degree of stability to the residents of Fukushima prefecture.It is very important to note that there is still quite a bit missing from the new plan. Most importantly, there is no mention of whether or how TEPCO might remove the roughly one thousand tonnes of nuclear fuel from the broken reactors before they are dismantled. This may be because radiation levels near the reactors are too high to contemplate further cleanup, or perhaps because the utility does not expect to be in charge of the next phase of the clean up."
1841,abhishek_sharma,19 Apr 2011 06:43 ,"Nuclear safety chief calls for reformhttp://www.nature.com/news/2011/110418/full/472274a.htmlLaurent Stricker, chairman of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), says that the disaster at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant should mark a turning point for an industry that many experts believe has become complacent about the safety of its reactors. Created in 1989, WANO is an international forum, headquartered in London, that brings together all nuclear power plant operators, along with governments and nuclear experts, to improve operational safety across the industry. Stricker is a nuclear engineer and former power plant director, and is also the senior adviser on nuclear affairs to the French utility company EDF.Should Fukushima prompt WANO to change its remit?Until now, WANO has addressed lessons learned from reactor operations, but not reactor design issues. I think in the future it should, in particular so that when operators modify their designs they draw more on analyses of past accidents.It is not easy to designate one reactor design as safer than another. Rather, one must look at the particular case of each reactor's implementation, and its location. A reactor exposed to the threat of a tsunami doesn't face the same risks as a reactor of the same design elsewhere.Population proximity is also very important. Japan, like many other countries, has several enormous nuclear sites near dense populations, so those demand even higher safety margins. After Fukushima, I believe that safety reviews should also consider the risk of accidents at several reactors at the same site at the same time. Often the current plans are only done for an accident in one reactor at a site.We also need to be prepared for events exceeding what a reactor was designed to withstand, and to learn how best to cope with accidents such as a loss of electricity supply and cooling capacity, as happened at Fukushima Daiichi. That means having the right emergency procedures and equipment, and regular emergency drills, often involving the local population. Some countries do this very well; others do it much less, or not at all.In October, WANO will bring together in China the chief executives of all the nuclear operators to discuss lessons learned from Fukushima, and any changes needed to WANO's mandate. WANO needs to be in a position to verify that every nuclear operating company has plans to cope with unforeseen accidents.Has the industry been overconfident that a serious nuclear accident is now impossible?Absolutely. I worry about overconfidence. People think we have good designs, we have good operators, we have good procedures and good safety authorities, so they think everything is fine.Does the International Nuclear Events Scale distort the true safety record of the industry, with 'near misses' being registered as low-level incidents rather than potential disasters?I think you are right. And it's true that the scale of severity is used in very different ways from one country to another. You also have differences in transparency from one country, and from one operator, to the next. At WANO, for example, we ask member companies to report incidents to us so that we can analyse them and share lessons from them. But between 5% and 7% of the power plants don't report any events in a given year. As an operator, I'm convinced that anyone running a nuclear power plant is bound to have something to report over the course of a year.Could greater international oversight improve safety?My point of view is that there are not enough plans in place to immediately help an operator in another country to cope with an accident.Also, for countries that are relatively new to operating nuclear power plants, peer review before plant start-up is essential because serious accidents have often occurred in new reactors shortly after start-up. WANO sends teams of 20–25 engineers from other nuclear plants to review the functioning of the new plant for about three weeks and to provide a confidential report. The International Atomic Energy Agency has a similar programme that does five or six similar reviews per year; WANO has greater resources and conducts about 40 of these reviews a year. At our meeting in China, I will propose increasing their frequency.I have also proposed that if operators fail to make progress on issues flagged by these reports as 'areas for improvement', then WANO should be authorized to dispense with its obligations of confidentiality.If there is another major accident, is nuclear energy finished?I fear so. As we have seen at Fukushima, an accident in one country has consequences for all nuclear operators elsewhere. Fukushima Plan: Achieving Cold Shutdown Could Take 6 Monthshttp://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/fukushima-plan-achieving-cold-sh.htmlOfficials with Tokyo Electric Power Co. have outlined their plans for ending the saga of the stricken reactors at the Fukushima Daichi power plant. In the first 3 to 6 months, according to the plan, crews will try to cool the reactors to a stable point, aiming for “cold shutdown” with temperatures within the reactors below 100°C. Then engineers will inject nitrogen into the pressure vessel surrounding each reactor. Using this inert gas should make it possible to minimize the use of water in the reactor vessel and reduce the risk of hydrogen explosions, which have already rocked three of the reactors. But crews will aim to use water to cool the outer containment vessel. The second step will focus on stopping the leakage of radionuclides into the air, essentially by fixing the outer walls of the damaged reactors or replacing them with freestanding, cubic containment barriers. There is no timetable for the government to ease restrictions on residents who live within the 20-kilometer-radius evacuation zone.The Japanese effort “seems to be on track, but [there’s] a long way to go,” says Lake Barrett, who helped lead the cleanup effort for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 3 decades ago at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.He says a big challenge for the Japanese is to start recirculating water they’ve used to cool the reactors; they have already created 10 million gallons of radioactive water in a once-through process called “feed and bleed."" ""They need to get those cores on recirculation and off of feed and bleed. It is drowning them with radioactive water,” Barrett says. By the end of the shutdown effort at Three Mile Island, Lake says, U.S. engineers were left with far less radioactive water, about 600,000 gallons."

So there is not even circumstantial evidence to indicate otherwise as of now.Bade - As you know but I may add, there is BIG difference between mutation and mutation leading to cancers or doing real harm. . Relationship between radiation and mutation is fairly well understood, more radiation causes more mutation (so that Kerala study about more mutation is expected) but dna repairs itself for virtually all the mutations.

This announcement is to notify the roadmap  that we have put together towards restoration from the accident. 1. Basic Policy By bringing the reactors and spent fuel  pools to a stable cooling condition and mitigating the release of radioactive materials, we will make every effort to enable evacuees to return to their homes and for all citizens to be able to secure a sound life. 2. Targets Based on the basic policy, the following two steps are set as targets:  “Radiation dose is in steady decline” as “Step 1” and “Release of radioactive materials is under control and radiation dose is being significantly held down” as “Step 2.”  Target achievement dates are tentatively set as follows:  “Step 1” is set at around 3 months and “Step 2” is set at around 3 to 6 months after achieving Step 1. 3. Immediate Actions Immediate actions were divided into three groups, namely, “I. Cooling”, “II. Mitigation”, “III. Monitoring and Decontamination.”  For the following five issues—“Cooling the Reactors,” “Cooling the Spent Fuel Pools,” “Containment, Storage, Processing, and Reuse of Water Contaminated by Radioactive Materials (Accumulated Water),” “Mitigation of  Release of Radioactive Materials to Atmosphere and from Soil,” and “Measurement, Reduction and Announcement of Radiation Dose in Evacuation Order/Planned Evacuation/ Emergency Evacuation Preparation Areas”—targets are set for  each of the five issues and various countermeasures will be implemented simultaneously. Please see the attachment for detailed actions. We would like to deeply apologize again for the grave inconvenience and anxiety that the broad public has been suffering due to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station.

1862,chaanakya,19 Apr 2011 18:24 ,"Nuke plant meltdown warning went unheededMeanwhile, the Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organization (JNES) released last fall a simulation in which a nuclear reactor would have a core meltdown and other consequences only 100 minutes after losing its cooling capabilities.The fact that the nation had been warned of the worst-case scenario is likely to pressure the government and electric power companies to review their nuclear designs and screening process.The JNES comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and is an independent administrative institution tasked with studying nuclear safety. It wrote a report in October last year after examining seven types of nuclear reactors and carried out simulations of quake-triggered severe accidents at the reactors.The pool for spent fuel at the No. 4 reactor of TEPCO's Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant is pictured in this Feb. 1, 2005, file photo. (Mainichi)It studied how a boiling water reactor (with an output capacity of 800,000 kilowatts) identical to the No. 2, 3, 4 and 5 reactors at the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant would react once it lost its power source and the function to cool the reactor core halted.The study shows that a meltdown began about one hour and 40 minutes after the water- pumping function stopped. About 3 hours and 40 minutes later, the pressure container broke down and about 6 hours and 50 minutes later the containment vessel also ruptured.At the Fukushima nuclear plant, the pressure within the containment vessel of the No. 1 reactor abnormally surged at 1:20 a.m. on March 12, about 8 hours and 40 minutes after the reactor's water-filling function failed. Radioactive steam was vented from the containment vessel and a hydrogen explosion occurred at 3:36 p.m. the same day.In the No. 3 reactor, the water injection function malfunctioned, prompting the release of radioactive steam and triggering a hydrogen explosion shortly after 11 a.m. on March 14. The reactor's cooling function equipped with the reactor's pre-warning device was believed to have been still operative for some time after the loss of its power source.As part of precautionary measures against severe accidents, power operators are required to take steps even if there is a low possibility of incidents that would induce such accidents. In the Fukushima nuclear disaster, emergency diesel generators lost electricity due to the tsunami. No one had projected a situation in which all emergency power generators could not be used for many hours.Tadashi Yoshida, a professor of reactor engineering at Tokyo City University, said, ""No one, including myself, ever imagined all emergency power generators would be wiped out. We could not imagine this worse-case scenario. We should radically review the design guidelines and the state's screening process.""Takeshi Matsuoka, a guest professor of system engineering at Utsunomiya University, said, ""In view of the huge damage and social losses from potential consequences, the government should have ordered them to draw up measures even if the chances of electricity loss were low. Members of the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan and other people in responsible positions have apparently lacked vision to utilize JNES's knowledge. The respective electric power companies must have had the resources to independently analyze the results of the JNES results."""

He was followed by Makoto Masuda, former head of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, and Hiroshi Kawasaki and Susumu Shirakawa, both former assistant directors of the energy agency, and one of TEPCO's six vice president positions is now apparently reserved for former ministry bureaucrats."

The concentration of the radioactive substances is to be reduced to one-one thousandth to one-ten thousandth of the current level. A similar system is already in place in France.Lauvergeon said it is most important to decontaminate the water at the plant, and that her company will try to do this in every possible way.TEPCO told reporters on the same day that it has adopted Areva's proposal. The company says it will first transfer the contaminated water into a waste processing facility at the plant, and then decontaminate 1,200 tons of the water per day. It hopes to use decontaminated water to cool the reactors.TEPCO hopes to start operating the decontamination facility in June.Tuesday, April 19, 2011 21:47 +0900 (JST)"

The total amount of contaminated water accumulating in the plant's premises is estimated to be a little less than 70,000 tons.The pools of water at the site are believed to be a side effect of a stopgap measure of injecting water into many of the plant's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools, which have lost cooling functions since the March 11 quake and tsunami, to prevent them from overheating.After decontamination these 70,000 tonnes of water could be sold in US as Fukushima Water  as it would have low radiation level which are beneficial.

People in Japan knew what the bargain was both for NPP as well as building settlements in Tsunami zones from historical records. There is always a bargain in any situation when one uses technology including driving cars, flying etc. So far the measurable evidence from high background radiation elsewhere and its impact on human health is inconclusive, and the exposure levels to the general population from Fukushima is well below the danger zone for a cumulative dose threshold over a lifespan. In fact they opposed it. But their voices went unheard in the face of money of Nuke lobby and power of the Govt. Japan had different reason to go Nuclear. It has no coal and oil reserve worth its name.  So lets say it is inconclusive . that's not the same as saying it is harmless as some would like us to believe.  It depends on the area. Certainly in some areas and plant premises and fukushima city and evacuation zone it would be higher for general public for whom limit is set 1 mSV in normal times and currently 10 mSv as per some report and 20 mSV by some other reports.  And when people are evacuated from the zone to be returned after indefinite period of time for no fault of theirs, how can one say that we can't attribute deaths to radiation since no one died. Do we wait for them to die to  understand that Nuclear Plant  accident radiation is harmful."

Some may be my guesses but most, I think, are consistent with what the experts are saying. 1. As said before (actually right in the beginning - see my posts then) It is a long term process. Chernobyl burqa took something like 8 months. Radiation has to subside, calculation have to be made, plans have to be checked and double checked etc.2. Full (as much as full can be called) will take about 10-20 years. (See my post in the beginning again, or MITNSE type sites). This is the time frame to treat all the water , move all Cs, fuel rods, eent-pathar out, clean up soil etc, and burry it all. Expensive process, but nothing unexpected, even scheduled retiring  of NPP, one has to do that.3. 3 Months period -  hope fully (actually there are positive indications that the time frame is ok)  cooling pumps etc are restored, and normal ""cold shutdown"" condition is reached. 4. By this time, the decay heat would have fallen enough (according to best available data) and stable condition would have reached. This means - water temp would be below 100C with normal/stable cooling.5. At this time, perhaps, containers would be examined and any leaks would be  sealed to keep the inside inside. Next 5-6 months all reactors may be flooded in water by erecting swimming pool type walls or make the whole part an artificial lake  (There are some concerns, - earth-quakes related - to make sure the walls would be okay). - This is perhaps better deal than concrete burqa. 6. Radiation level will be closely monitored. Things will settle down in next 3 months or so. 7. Iodine half life is small, so 3 months will reduce the quantity by a factor or 1000x. Cs has relatively short biological half life (month or so) so food etc would be monitored. Soil may need to be cleaned up etc. But this can be done at its own pace.... Just some points...Take it for whatever it's worth For once , i am inclined to agree with this. It would take 10-20 yrs and in my estimate plant is as good as gone.  What solutions would be provided would depend on  they want to proceed with it based on the real ground situation. Though not yet clear about fate of Plant 5 & 6 as they seems to be fine.don't agree much though on Point 6&7 , , need continuous monitoring.

1872,chaanakya,19 Apr 2011 22:46 ,"OPINION: How to minimize consequences of the Fukushima catastropheBy Alexey V. YablokovMOSCOW, April 15, KyodoThe analysis of the health impact of radioactive land contamination by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, made by Professor Chris Busby (the European Committee of Radiation Risk) based on official Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology data, has shown that over the next 50 years it would be possible to have around 400,000 additional cancer patients within a 200-kilometer radius of the plant.This number can be lower and can be even higher, depending on strategies to minimize the consequences. Underestimation is more dangerous for the people and for the country than overestimation.Based on Chernobyl experiences, it is necessary to understand that it may be impossible to quickly get back to life before the catastrophe and to accept the post-Fukushima realities as soon as possible.The main directions of actions that should be taken:1. Enlarge the exclusion zone to at least about a 50-km radius of the plant;2. Distribute detailed instructions on effective ways to protect the health of individuals while avoiding the additional contamination of food. Organize regular measurements of all people by individual dose counters (for overall radionuclides) at least once a week. Distribute the radioprotectors and decontaminants (substances which provide the body protection against harmful effects of radiation) of radionuclides. There are many of such food additives;3. Develop recommendations for safe agriculture on the contaminated territories: reprocessing of milk, decontamination of meat, turning agriculture into production of technical cultures (e.g. biofuels etc.). Such ''radionuclide-resistant'' agriculture will be costly (it may be up to 30-40 percent compared with conventional agriculture) and needs to be subsidized;4. It is necessary to urgently improve existing medical centers -- and possibly create new ones -- to deal with the immediate and long-term consequences of the irradiated peoples (including medical-genetic consultations on the basis of chromosome analysis etc.);5. The most effective way to help organize post-Fukushima life in the contaminated territories (from Chernobyl lessons) is to create a special powerful interagency state body (ministry or committee) to handle the problems of contaminated territories during the first most complicated years.I am sure that Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian radiation medicine and agriculture specialists, radiobiologists and radioecologists who have enormous experience in fighting radiation consequences will be ready to cooperate with Japan.(Alexey V. Yablokov is a councilor for the Russian Academy of Science and a principal author of ''Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment,'' published in 2009).==KyodoI was curious about his book so here is the wiki link on the bookhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl: ... nvironmentNeutrality of Wiki is doubted yet it makes some valid points.Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment is a translation of a 2007 Russian publication by Alexey V. Yablokov, Vassily B. Nesterenko, and Alexey V. Nesterenko. It was published by the New York Academy of Sciences in 2009 in their Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences series.[1]There is significant disagreement on the degree of long-term adverse impacts of the Chernobyl disaster, despite decades of environmental and heath effects research.[2][3] The environmentalist Amory Lovins has writtenThe United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation's 2005 estimate of about 4,000 Chernobyl deaths contrasts with this review of 5,000 mainly Slavic-language scientific papers the UNSCEAR overlooked. It found deaths approaching a million through 2004, nearly 170,000 of them in North America.[4]The book was not peer reviewed by the New York Academy of Sciences,[5] but has been reviewed in the Oxford Journal Radiation Protection Dosimetry[6] in February 2010.Two expert reviews of the book were commissioned by the Oxford journal Radiation Protection Dosimetry. The first, by Dr. Ian Fairlie[7] greets the book as a ""welcome addition to the literature in English. The New York Academy of Sciences [is] to be congratulated for publishing this volume. [...] In the opinion of the reviewer, this volume makes it clear that international nuclear agencies and some national authorities remain in denial about the scale of the health disasters in their countries due to Chernobyl's fallout. This is shown by their reluctance to acknowledge contamination and health outcomes data, their ascribing observed morbidity/mortality increases to non-radiation causes, and their refusal to devote resources to rehabilitation and disaster management."" Fairlie notes two shortcomings of the book: that it does not sufficiently investigate the large decrease in average male life spans throughout Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, in both contaminated and uncontaminated areas; and that it does not make enough effort to reconstruct estimated doses of contamination and discuss their implications for eastern and western Europe (though Fairlie agrees with the authors that studies should not be rejected for failing to contain dose estimates—a criterion commonly applied by western nuclear agencies such as the IAEA). Fairlie specifically concurs with Yablakov et al. on three points:The IAEA's exclusion of data where estimated dose is below a certain threshold (following ICRP recommendations) is contrary to normal practice, even the ICRP's own practice, and contradicts the linear no-threshold model (LNT). The ICRP's recommendation in this regard is inconsistent with LNT and its own practices.The IAEA/WHO have often sought to justify their dismissal of eastern European epidemiological studies by citing questionable scientific practices: but epidemiology is not an exact science, and the same shortcomings exist in western studies uncriticised by the IAEA. The IAEA also point to shortcomings with pre-Chernobyl Soviet cancer registries, but cancer registries in western countries had similar issues at that time.In observational epidemiological studies where certain data is already known and certain effects are expected, statistical tests for significance of the results are not normally required. Yet the IAEA has challenged such papers that do not include statistical tests and confidence intervals, and questioned whether the observed effects are due to chance. Eastern scientists are faced with a catch-22 situation whereby they either (correctly) leave out statistical tests, and are dismissed, or else apply the tests, leading western scientists to (incorrectly) conclude that there is no real effect.The second review (in the same volume), by Dr. Monty Charles,[8] is largely critical, noting several problems:The authors expressly discount socioeconomic or screening factors when considering increased occurrence of diseases, but this methodology does not seem to account for variations between territories prior to the accident.Their discussion of 'hot particle' poisoning is cursory, and is unclear regarding dosage figures.The chapter on health effects, 60% of the book, contains inadequate explanation or critical evaluation of many cited facts and figures, and in many instances related tables, figures and statements appear to contradict each other.A section abstract predicted numbers of casualties due to cancer, however the section did not contain any discussion to support these numbers.While Charles agrees with the importance of making eastern research more available in the west, he states that he cannot tell which of the publications referred to by the book would sustain critical peer-review in western scientific literature, and that verifying these sources would require considerable effort. Charles sees the book as representing one end of a spectrum of views, and believes that works from the entire spectrum must be critically evaluated in order to develop an informed opinion.In George Monbiot's recent exchanges with anti-nuclear activist Helen Caldicott and John Vidal on the matter of the total death toll of Chernobyl, Caldicott and Vidal made reference to Yablokov's book. Monbiot responded by saying:A devastating review in the journal Radiation Protection Dosimetry points out that the book achieves this figure by the remarkable method of assuming that all increased deaths from a wide range of diseases – including many which have no known association with radiation – were caused by the Chernobyl accident. There is no basis for this assumption, not least because screening in many countries improved dramatically after the disaster and, since 1986, there have been massive changes in the former eastern bloc. The study makes no attempt to correlate exposure to radiation with the incidence of disease.The passage Monbiot is referring to comes from Charles' review, and actually relates to the 2006 Greenpeace report on Chernobyl, not the book by Yablokov et al.[8]Read the book here if you are a member of NYAS ( I am not)http://www.nyas.org/publications/annals ... 3f44b3bfc1"

Cohen analyzed 4438 lung cancer deaths, in comparison with the ""nearly 1,000"" in the UK study.[Cohen BL. Questionnaire study of the lung cancer risk from radon in homes. Health Phys 1997;72(4):615-622. ""First-time measurements of radon levels in homes, self-selected by occupants, were accompanied by questionnaires asking about people who had lived in the house and died of cancer. Responses were received before-measurement results were available. The ratio of lung cancer deaths to deaths from other cancers was plotted as a function of radon level in the house. The results seem to indicate essentially no dependence of this ratio on radon exposure, in sharp contrast to the strong increase with increasing radon exposure predicted by the theory which should have been easily observable. Possible explanations of the discrepancy are discussed. Use of two alternative control groups increases the discrepancy with theory. This work has no connection with the recent test of the linear nonthreshold theory in the low dose region by the same author.""]But Praful Bidwai and their chelas will keep harping on the hypothesis and 985,000 deaths, merely because their model says so. /sigh/"

Here is a news item:Entergy files suit to keep plant openEntergy Corporation has filed a complaint with the US District Court in a bid to prevent the state of Vermont from forcing the closure of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in 2012. Vermont Yankee (Image: NRC) The suit filed by Entergy subsidiaries Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear Operations follows the March 2011 decision by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to renew the plant's operating licence to March 2032. The single boiling water reactor plant has been in operation since 1972. The state of Vermont remains opposed to the operation of the plant beyond the expiry of its original licence, in March 2012. The NRC's licence renewal decision, reached after an in-depth review, would normally be sufficient to ensure that a plant could continue to operate. However, in the case of Vermont Yankee, state approval is also needed for it to extend operations – a condition of the purchase of the plant by Entergy in 2002. Under a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed at the time, the two Entergy subsidiaries had agreed they would seek a certificate of public good from the Vermont Public Service Board if seeking to operate the plant beyond 21 March 2012. Entergy contests that a law passed by the Vermont General Assembly in 2006 repudiated the MoU, breaching the agreement and excusing the two Entergy subsidiaries' obligation to further comply with that specific provision. ""The 2006 state law took the decision about Vermont Yankee's future away from the Public Service Board, a quasi-judicial expert decision-maker, independent of legislative control,"" said Entergy Wholesale Commodities president Richard Smith. In so doing, it ""placed Vermont Yankee's fate in the hands of political decision-makers,"" who could deny the plant's continued operation for unsupported or arbitrary reasons. ""This is not what we signed up for in 2002,"" Smith added.Entergy says it has made considerable efforts to achieve the necessary state approvals to allow the continued operation of the plant without resorting to litigation, including filing for a certificate of public good, offering Vermont utilities favourable terms for long-term power purchase agreements, offering to negotiate a date for commencement of decommissioning activities at Vermont Yankee earlier than the 60-year SAFSTOR period permitted by NRC regulations, and exploring the potential sale of the plant. The company says its recent attempts to sell the plant were stymied by political uncertainty in the state, and ""more specifically, due to the stated intent of Vermont officials to shut down the plant."" Smith described litigation as by far the last preferred approach, but the action was taken following a 30 March meeting between Entergy and state governor Peter Shumlin in which the governor reiterated his opposition to the continued operation of Vermont Yankee beyond March 2012. The suit contends that the state of Vermont is violating the Atomic Energy Act in asserting that it can close a federally licensed and operating nuclear power plant, and the Federal Power Act in making an agreement to provide power to Vermont utilities at preferential wholesale rates a condition of continued operation. Meanwhile, Governor Shumlin accused Entergy of ""attempting to rewrite history."" Shumlin states that the 2006 law clearly outlined the requirements for continued operation of a nuclear power plant in the state. ""When it purchased Vermont Yankee, Entergy clearly agreed that it must obtain a new state licence to operate beyond March 2012, and that it would not attempt to claim preemption regarding the state's licensing decision,"" he said. ""Vermont has a proper role in granting or denying state approval for Vermont Yankee,"" he added. "

1877,Amber G.,20 Apr 2011 07:30 ,"Plans for Fukushima basement pumpingPlans to remove contaminated water from Fukushima Daiichi 2 should see it moved at the rate of 480 tonnes per day. Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) has released details of the arrangements for dealing with the mass 25,000 tonnes of water that has accumulated in the basement of the turbine building of unit 2 at the damaged nuclear power plant. This leak to sea has now been plugged, water levels are rising within the building and must be dealt with The water has a high level of radioactive contamination which is assumed to have come from direct contact with damaged nuclear fuel in the reactor core. Somehow this water appears to have has left the reactor coolant circuit and massed in the bottom of the turbine building. There it prevents workers from repairing cables that could enable the return of normal cooling and maintenance systems. The 25,000 tonnes of accumulated water contains 3.0x106 becquerels from iodine-131 as well as 1.3x107 becquerels from caesium-137 per cubic centimetre. This leads to unacceptable dose rates at its surface of over 1000 millisieverts per hour. This water had previously been leaking directly to sea through a 20 centimetre crack in the wall of a connected shaft adjacent to the sea. This was sealed a few days after its discovery and as a result the water level within this building has now begun to rise. About 168 tonnes of fresh water is injected to the reactor core each day to maintain adequate cooling. Tepco cannot confirm, but it is widely assumed that some of this water goes on to accumulate in the turbine building basement. Although units 1 to 4 at Fukushima Daiichi have water in their turbine buildings, only that in unit 2 suffers this high level contamination. Hydrogen explosions earlier in the accident destroyed the top sections of the roofs of units 1 and 3. However, in unit 2 loud noises accompanied apparent damage to the torus suppression chamber, leading to speculation that this may form part of the route for water to take from the reactor core. With water levels rising in unit 2, Tepco has made efforts to seal any potential leakage route from the lower turbine building, which is not normally a radiation-controlled area. The company will also inhibit any potential leakage by maintaining pressures in the building to levels below ground water pressure and running pipes through other reactor buildings where possible. Preparations are now in progress to pump this water at the rate of some 480 tonnes per day into a centralized waste treatment building, whose normal contents have already been cleared out. In an extraordinary measure two weeks ago the Japanese government approved Tepco to dump some 11,500 tonnes of very mildly radioactive water from the treatment facility and other places to sea. This released a total of 1.5x1011 becquerels of radioactivity, the same amount as contained in just ten litres of the basement water. The treatment facility can securely hold about 10,000 tonnes of the water. It will initially use coprecipitation methods to decontaminate the water but by June these will be complimented by ion-exchange equipment and additional storage tanks. Tepco said it plans to have a closed loop for cooling unit 2 ""by around July"" meaning that the decontaminated fresh water will be re-injected for cooling. Eventually it should be possible to drain all the water and dispose of the buildings. "

The agency had previously only described the nuclear fuel as having been at least 3 percent ""damaged.""According to Nishiyama, damage to reactors can be described in three phases of increasing severity. In the first phase of initial damage to a reactor's core, the metallic casing surrounding the fuel pellets are damaged but the pellets remain intact. The second phase involves some melting of nuclear fuel. In the third phase, what is known as a meltdown, all the fuel pellets melt and accumulate at the bottom of the containment vessel.The agency said it now believes the fuel pallets have melted because of the high levels of radiation detected at the Nos. 2 and 3 reactors. Melting fuel pellets also likely led to a hydrogen explosion at the No. 1 reactor, Nishiyama said.Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of the crippled plant, has said the cores of the Nos. 1 to 3 reactors have been damaged by 25 percent to 70 percent. But the agency emphasized that these figures are only estimates.""We can't say for sure about how much has melted until the rods are actually taken out,"" Nishiyama said.(Apr. 20, 2011)Looks like they are slowly releasing the info.

Lately, the world has been rocked by more than its usual share of the biggest earthquakes ever accurately recorded: the magnitude-9.0 “megaquake” that just struck off Japan; another one that hit off Indonesia 6 years ago; and sandwiched between them, the great magnitude-8.8 Chilean quake of 2010. Before these three, however, nothing like them had been seen for 40 years.Chile 1960. The largest quake on record, a magnitude 9.5, was part of a 1950–1965 cluster.CREDIT: APCould these three big quakes be physically connected? Could the first of them somehow have touched off a cluster of great earthquakes spanning the Pacific? And if so, has this cluster played itself out? Experts differ. “Our position is this could be continuing,” says seismologist Charles Bufe, scientist emeritus at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Golden, Colorado. On the basis of statistical testing, he says, “I think we're in an increased hazardous situation for these very large earthquakes” around the world.But Andrew Michael, a seismologist at USGS in Menlo Park, California, says his own statistical tests tell a different story. “I simply can't find any reason to reject the random hypothesis,” he says. That is, he cannot prove that anything but chance is responsible for huge quakes coming on one another's heels.Seismologists recognized some time ago that the largest earthquakes are not evenly sprinkled throughout the 110-year-long seismic record. In a 2005 Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America paper, Bufe and his USGS Golden colleague David Perkins, a statistician, assessed a big-quake cluster that ran from 1950 through 1965 (see graph). It included seven of the nine greatest quakes of the 20th century (the big jump in the middle of the graph), among them all three of the century's megaquakes —quakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater. But after 1965, Bufe and Perkins noted, 36 years passed without even a quake of magnitude 8.4 or greater.Stepping up again.Two clusters of the biggest quakes appear as steps (center and right) in this plot of cumulative earthquake size.CREDIT: UPDATED FROM C. AMMON ET AL., SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS 81, 6 (NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2010)In the same 2005 paper, Bufe and Perkins thought they had an inkling of a second cluster getting started. A magnitude-8.4 quake off Peru in 2001 pointed to a coming cluster, they wrote. In a note added just before the journal was printed, they drew attention to the then-recent magnitude-9.1 Sumatra megaquake of December 2004, which was shortly followed by a magnitude-8.7 quake just to the south. The two quakes “confirm that we have entered a new period of … probable temporal clustering of mega-quakes,” they wrote in the note. Sure enough, the great Chile quake followed 6 years later, and then came last month's Japanese Tohoku megaquake (smaller steps on right of graph).No one knows how even a megaquake could have triggered another large quake on the other side of the Pacific, but Bufe and Perkins don't think they just got lucky. They have now made 100,000 computer runs randomly generating simulated earthquake records to see how often such tight clusterings might crop up purely by chance. “It turns out to be 2% of the time,” Bufe said at a press conference at last week's annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America (SSA) in Nashville. “That is very significant.”Many seismologists are not so confident. “There's nothing wrong in pointing [clustering] out,” says seismologist Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, but “you can't really do statistics on such a small data set.” And seismologist Richard Aster of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro said at the SSA press conference that “if the data are sliced just right, you can get numbers that sound interesting, but there are other methods that are just as appropriate that find no [statistically significant] clustering.”Michael, who, like Bufe and Aster, presented assessments of clustering at the meeting, says Bufe and Perkins's claim results from “a serious statistical mistake.” He said at the press conference, “We can't run experiments, so we're stuck testing our hypotheses on the same data we developed them on.”That limitation requires statistical tests that are more general and less closely tied to the existing seismic record than those Bufe and Perkins ran, Michael said. After performing several such tests, he added, “I find the data are very well explained by the random model” over a range of magnitudes. In the case of megaquakes, Michael said, the problem could be the dearth of megaquakes in the record: “Maybe there really is clustering, but there's not enough data yet to prove it. Without a specific physical mechanism to test, the only way out of this is waiting for more earthquakes.”If Bufe and Perkins are right, Michael may not have long to wait. “The probability of a magnitude-9 or larger event—based on our model—in the next 6 years is 24% if these [past quakes] are random,” Bufe said at the press conference. “If these are clustered, the probability is 63%.”The dispute is not deterring most researchers. As earthquake physicist Emily Brodsky of the University of California, Santa Cruz, puts it, “It would be naïve of us to assume this is all random and not worth investigating.” A Map of Fukushima's Radiation Riskshttp://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/a-map-of-fukushimas-radiation.htmlA new map from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) shows the long-term radiation risks to people living near Japan's ailing Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.DOE-sponsored aerial surveys began measuring radiation around the plant about 10 days after the reactor was hit by a tsunami on 11 March. The maps released before, however, have been reporting current radiation levels. Now DOE has projected what the first-year dose would be to people living around the plant up to about 80 kilometers away (see map). The analysis, released on 18 April, takes into account the fact that radiation levels are slowly falling—mainly due to the decay of iodine-131, which has a half-life of 8 days. It shows the high end of external exposures—what people would receive if they didn't evacuate after the accident and didn't follow advice to stay indoors.In the red swath of land northwest of the plant where weather deposited a lot of fallout, potential exposures exceed 2000 millirems/year. That is the level at which the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would consider relocating the public. The area includes the places outside the 20 kilometer evacuation zone where Japanese officials advised that people evacuate last week. (Yesterday, Japan announced it will begin enforcing a ban on entering the evacuation zone itself.)Although 2000 millirems over 1 year isn't an immediate health threat, it's enough to cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults and one case in 100 1-year-olds, says Owen Hoffman, a radiation risk expert with SENES Oak Ridge Inc. in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Still, there are parts of the world—in Guarapari, Brazil for example—where natural background radiation levels are even higher. Also worth keeping in mind is that the normal disease rate is much higher: four in 10 people will eventually develop cancer without exposure to extra radiation, Hoffman notes.Japanese officials will need to decide whether people should be allowed to return to these areas (and hot spots with even higher radiation levels) and explain the risks, says Hoffman. ""It depends on how much hardship is associated [with long-term evacuation]. They will have to balance social and economic considerations against future health risks.""Credit: US DOE"

The report calls for a long-term spent fuel U.S. repository but says the country can get by for the short term with interim storage of fuel rods at plants or other facilities. By instituting a carbon price, the report says, ""nuclear becomes either competitive or lower-cost than either coal or natural gas.""Cost studies by faculty scientists at MIT provide the underpinning of the findings, which suggest that advanced reactor systems in the future might be able to recycle waste. But it says the U.S. Department of Energy's research program on nuclear energy, budgeted in 2011 for $737 million, needs to grow to at least $1 billion per year to explore more advanced conceptions of nuclear power.The report appears ahead of one from the White House Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future due out in June. And it doesn't address the Fukushima crisis triggered by the 11 March earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Had the panel had time to do so, says MIT nuclear engineer Charles Forsberg, who served as executive director on the project, ""I don't think it would have changed any of the major conclusions of our report. We're looking at long term fuel cycle issues versus short term safety issues, which are what came out of Fukushima.""The new report is considered a good guide to what the influential Blue Ribbon panel is expected to say on issues related to the fuel cycle.Some of the Blue Ribbon commissioners were part of the MIT panel's advisory board and provided extensive input. ""We didn't hear any loud shouting or screaming from them when we briefed them on the report's conclusions,"" says Forsberg. It's not known whether the Blue Ribbon panel, which is holding its cards close, will include an analysis of the Fukushima disaster or recommendations that stem from it. The panel's next public meeting is on 13 May, but no agenda has been posted.A ""Postscript"" to the MIT report, added since last fall's preliminary report, says that the Fukushima event will probably make nuclear power more expensive and focus more attention on safety and spent fuel. But it makes no related policy recommendations, saying the Japanese disaster only strengthens the report's call for more research on spent fuel storage.""We're very explicit in this report. We say, 'You need a spent fuel policy,' "" says Forsberg. Highly packed spent fuel pools at the Japanese facility have caught fire, lost coolant, and released unknown quantities of radioactive material, underscoring the need to remove as much fuel from overcrowded pools as possible. It notes that a storage facility that could hold spent fuel for several decades while it cools could free up space in reactors' pools, lowering the risk of overheating, loss of coolant, and fires. ""In that sense, the report reinforces the Fukushima [message] on spent fuel,"" says Forsberg. ""We're saying, 'You know, guys, this is one more reason you need a spent fuel policy.' ""The 258-page report included input from more than a dozen graduate student theses in physics, economics, and engineering. "

1920,Sanku,27 Apr 2011 11:42 ,"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/world ... usion.htmlCulture of Complicity Tied to Stricken Nuclear PlantTOKYO — Given the fierce insularity of Japan’s nuclear industry, it was perhaps fitting that an outsider exposed the most serious safety cover-up in the history of Japanese nuclear power. It took place at Fukushima Daiichi, the plant that Japan has been struggling to get under control since last month’s earthquake and tsunami.In 2000, Kei Sugaoka, a Japanese-American nuclear inspector who had done work for General Electric at Daiichi, told Japan’s main nuclear regulator about a cracked steam dryer that he believed was being concealed. If exposed, the revelations could have forced the operator, Tokyo Electric Power, to do what utilities least want to do: undertake costly repairs. In Japan, the web of connections between the nuclear industry and government officials is now popularly referred to as the “nuclear power village.” The expression connotes the nontransparent, collusive interests that underlie the establishment’s push to increase nuclear power despite the discovery of active fault lines under plants, new projections about the size of tsunamis and a long history of cover-ups of safety problems. "
1921,amit,27 Apr 2011 14:05 ,"I suppose after all the various stalwarts and websites that have been quoted on this site, even the New American has become halal to quote. In this article, author Ed Hiserodt, who wrote a book called What if Radiation is Actually Good for You?  , has some interesting things to say.The situation in Japan is grim. Estimates of the dead or missing — and by now this latter group must be moved into the dead column — is above 25,000 souls. A half-million residents are homeless, with many in danger of starvation since roads and railroads have simply disappeared. Yet the world’s media pays only lip service to the plight of Japanese citizens. It is almost entirely focused on the disabled nuclear reactors and the “leaks” of radiation that have had, and will have, virtually no effect on human health.[b]Note: In the Fukushima prefecture itself a dam burst minutes after the earthquake and swept away 1,800 homes. Perhaps somebody on this thread - particularly those who are untiringly dredging all manner of negative reports they can trawl from the Net which badmouths the Japanese - could try to find something which could give an indication of what percentage of the roughly 25,000 dead, died on account of this dam? My rough estimate, even if one person per home died and nobody else who happened to be on the path of that water were killed, then we have score: Dead by dam burst in Fukushima: 1,800. Dead on account of radiation in Fukushima: 0. Interestingly, many of the expatriates “escaped” to areas where the background radiation was higher, in some cases much higher, than the areas in Japan they were evacuating owing to radioactive releases. An April 1 Bloomberg article by Stuart Biggs and Yuriy Humber gave the current background radiation measurements in Tokyo compared with other areas. Even after the releases in Japan, the amount of background radiation in Tokyo is still below the world average. The article quoted Bob Bury of the UK’s Royal College of Radiologists, “The situation in Japan looks set to follow the pattern of Chernobyl, where fear of radiation did far more damage than the radiation itself.”If we analyze for a moment the MSNBC.com story “Japan faces another dilemma: Radiation-contaminated bodies,” {thank God this piece of thrash wasn't posted here!}  we should remember that exposure to radiation does not make one radioactive, e.g., you don’t become radioactive from an X-ray. So any contamination would have had to settle out from the atmosphere onto the bodies. One might ask how the radioactive particles know how to zero in on the corpses and avoid the area that surrounds them.UConn physics professor emeritus Howard Hayden points out in his newsletter, The Energy Advocate, that the joke is on the Californians who are now gobbling down potassium iodine pills to saturate their thyroids in an attempt to block an accumulation of radioactive iodine. The “K” in KI pills is potassium, a small percentage of which is radioactive Potassium 40. In an attempt to avoid barely detectable amounts of Iodine 131, they are ingesting easily measurable amounts of bone-seeking Potassium 40. Actually this radiation won’t bother them either, although the pills are not gentle on the digestive system and give the same symptoms — nausea and cramping — as does real radiation sickness, which has afflicted no one in Japan, let alone thousands of miles away in the United States.The next quote is a keeper, should be posted as a sticky on this thread!Fear of radiation is a learned behavior. Moreover, it’s not something we learn from personal experience or observation. We have no way to sense it and must be told by others that we are in danger. As noted above, we receive plenty of information from the media on the dangers of radiation, and this is nothing new. Professor Bernard Cohen of the University of Pittsburgh looked at the New York Times Information Bank, which allows access to numerous publications, and found over the period 1974 to 1978 that there were about 120 stories per year on automobile accidents that killed some 200,000 people. But there were 200 stories per year on radiation that killed no one. Do you know anyone who died or was sickened by radiation? Do you know anybody who knows anybody who was such a victim? The odds are a million to one against it.Note: Tragically last year two of my relatives died in automobile accidents. Does that mean I should stop driving my car?Aside from death and radiation sickness resulting from extremely high doses of radiation, the only other known negative effect of radiation on humans is an increased risk of cancer. While certainly real, this threat seems overblown. Professor John Cameron, of the University of Wisconsin Medical School, points out that there were only about 400 excess cancer deaths in the tens of thousands of exposed individuals in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.If a large-scale, real-life sampling of radiation survivors didn’t validate hypotheses of skyrocketing cancer rates, though many of the affected people suffered acute radiation exposure, why then do we hear terrifying reports about the number of cancer deaths we can expect from the recent partial meltdown in Japan, where no one has been reported to have faced acute exposure? It is because of a statistical hypothesis known as Linear No Threshold theory, or LNT.Linear No Threshold theory assumes that there is a linear relationship in the amount of danger posed by increasing levels of radiation. Let’s use aspirin to demonstrate LNT at work. Assume that 100 tablets is a 100-percent fatal dose of aspirin. (That is roughly the case for a 200-pound man.) Linear No Threshold theory would predict that 50 tablets would cause a 50-percent mortality rate, 10 tablets would result in 10-percent mortality, and a single tablet would cause one percent of the users to die. We can pretty well agree that this doesn’t happen with aspirin, but we are told that it does for radiation.High doses of radiation, for example 100,000 mrem, are carcinogenic and generally follow the LNT. But there is a growing consensus among health professionals that no such risk occurs below 10,000 mrem. Anti-nuclear activists and the media haven’t caught on to this, however, as the following example shows.Let us assume that the risk of cancer increases by 10 percent for anyone exposed to 100,000 mrem of radiation. If we extrapolate this linearly to zero, then at 10,000 mrem we have a one-percent increase in cancer. At 10 mrem, there would be a 0.001 percent increased risk of cancer. Now comes a hypothetical release of radiation that blankets the country of Japan with a dose of 10 mrem, the U.S. average for 10 days from natural sources. With a population of 127,000,000 people and a mortality of 0.001 percent, the LNT predicts 1,270 increased cancer deaths. Of course the media would pick up on this fact as gospel, needlessly frightening the citizenry with fictitious threats of cancer and death.So what will be the likely outcome of the nuclear meltdown, and the subsequent release of radioactive elements, in Japan? Once pumps are fully operational and structural damage to the nuclear power plant is repaired, the level of radiation from venting the containment vessels and from uncovered spent-fuel cooling ponds will quickly drop, as will airborne particles. Within a few months, the 131I deposited on the ground will decay to zero. Some 137Cs (cesium) will remain detectable on the ground, but at present it appears to be only a tenth the amount of that from the Chernobyl incident — and the amount from Chernobyl was on the same order of magnitude as the natural radionuclides in the soil.Of course, anti-nuclear activists will predict thousands of cancer deaths based on the LNT, which will not happen, but no matter. Fear is the objective. As we have already seen, the Fukushima “disaster” will become the rallying cry against nuclear power. Few will remember that the plant stayed generally intact despite being hit by an earthquake with more than six times the energy the plant was designed to withstand, plus a tsunami estimated at 49 feet that swept away backup generators 33 feet above sea level. Wonder how those windmills would have stood up.We've already seen the above being played in a well-orchestrated fashion on this thread haven't we?"

The company said that it has made various recent equipment upgrades to enable the continued safe operation of Palo Verde including the replacement of components such as steam generators, reactor vessel heads and low-pressure turbines in all three units. APS also reached an agreement in 2010 with local cities guaranteeing the supply of sufficient cooling water for the plant through to 2050. The company is also modernising the plant's cooling towers. The NRC said, ""After careful review of the plant's safety systems and specifications, the staff concluded that the applicant had effectively demonstrated the capability to manage the effects of plant aging and that there are no safety concerns that would preclude licence renewal. In addition, NRC conducted inspections of the plant to verify information submitted by the applicant."" The renewal of the operating licences of the Palo Verde units brings the number of reactor licences renewed by the NRC to 66 out of a fleet of 104 reactors. The renewed licence of unit 1 will now expire in June 2045; unit 2's expires in April 2046; while that of unit 3 will run until November 2047. APS chairman and CEO Dan Brandt commented, ""The ongoing operation of Palo Verde is important to a reliable and affordable energy future for Arizona."" He added, ""For many more decades, Palo Verde will supply billions of kilowatt-hours that are safe, clean, low cost and secure."" ""As our response to recent events in Japan demonstrates, Palo Verde and the entire US nuclear power industry are committed to continuous learning and improvement to enhance safety,"" Brandt said. ""The NRC's approval of the licence renewal is a mandate for even greater commitment to safety at Palo Verde."" According to APS, power generation operations to date at Palo Verde have offset the emission of almost 484 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (the equivalent of taking up to 84 million cars off the road); more than 253,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide; and 618,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxide. The company noted, ""If Palo Verde were to cease operation at the end of the original licence, replacement cost of natural gas generation - the least expensive alternative - would total $36 billion over the 20-year licence renewal period."" The three units at Palo Verde are capable of generating nearly 4000 MWe. The plant supplies about one-third of the base-load power used in Arizona. The plant is owned by a consortium of seven utilities in the southwest of the USA. As well as operating Palo Verde, APS - with a 29.1% stake - is the largest shareholder in the plant"
1926,Amber G.,28 Apr 2011 22:05 ,"Indian response to safety callsIndian leaders are preparing to reassess some aspects of nuclear policy following the Fukushima accident and violent protests against a proposed nuclear plant at Jaitapur.  Yesterday the Indian government announced it would table a new nuclear safety law to create an autonomous nuclear regulatory body in the country and it would invite the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) operational safety review team (OSART) to help with future Indian nuclear industry safety reviews and audits. These measures would bring it into line with practice around the world, where nuclear safety is recognised as an area where neither business nor politics should have influence. The Indian government also said it would incorporate ""standalone safety systems"" in the design of each reactor in Jaitapur in Maharastra. The move follows intensifying demonstrations near the planned site, with one person being killed and 20 others injured on 18 April when police opened fire on an angry local population which attacked a police station in parallel with a planned demonstration at the plant site. In addition, India's environment minister Jairam Ramesh, a member of the government's dominant Congress party, had been shifting in his public statements over nuclear safety in general and Jaitapur in particular. In his most recent pronouncement, on 23 April in Ludhiana, Punjab, he said: ""The [Jaitapur] nuclear plant issue is a wakeup call after Fukushima and we cannot ignore the panic of the residents."" Furthermore, he advocated a ""pause button for the time being"" on approving new nuclear plants. On 15 April, he clarified his position on Jaitapur: he had not ""called for a re-think, I have called for a deeper thinking."" India has plans to increase its nuclear power capacity from the present 4780 MWe to 20,000 MWe by the year 2020 with the expansion of capacity to include 2500 MWe of fast breeder reactors and 8000 MWe of light water reactors. However, the Japanese crisis and the Jaitapur dispute have caused anxiety in the industry. Madhukar Vinayak Kotwal, senior executive vice president – heavy engineering for Larsen & Toubro, said that he was concerned that misinformation was being spread through the Jaitapur protests. ""I just hope that the protesters do not derail the entire nuclear program, which is vital for the energy needs of the country,"" he told World Nuclear News. Indeed some protesters are insisting on complete rollback. ""All the new nuclear plants that are being proposed should be scrapped and all the existing nuclear plants be gradually shut down,"" said Neeraj Jain, an organiser for India's National Alliance of Anti-Nuclear Movements. He said his group's strategy was aimed at persuading the central government that nuclear power is so unpopular, it supports the industry at its electoral peril. ""It has to come from the prime minister's office and only public pressure can force a change like in Germany,"" he said. However, in Maharashtra state, the chief minister Prithviraj Chavan (also a Congress party member) has already ruled out any possibility of abandoning the Jaitapur proposal. ""We are determined to complete the project and that too on schedule,"" he told Mumbai journalists on 21 April.   Kameswara Rao, energy and utilities leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers India, stressed that there was positive political capital associated with India's nuclear industry and that this could win the day in government assessments of future policy. He noted India's indigenous nuclear program had a good safety record and the imported reactors that will form part of the planned capacity expansion use the latest technology. He backed the government's latest announcement, saying there is a need for an independent nuclear sector regulator in India, periodic reassessments of safety, and more safety related information in the public domain."

The same procedure is being considered for the plant's two other stricken reactors.But engineers are holding back from executing the plan following tests yesterday, Nikkei.com reports, because of concerns that adding water to the containment vessel might create a negative pressure inside it that would draw in air and so perhaps trigger a hydrogen explosion. The weight of the water could also stress the containment vessel and lead to structural damage if an aftershock hit the reactor. Any leaks in the containment vessel could also worsen local contamination; attempts to remove highly contaminated water from the reactor basements continue to stall with more water leaking back into them than is being pumped out.Nikkei.com also reported that concerns about a possible leak in the fuel pond at reactor 4 have resurfaced. US supercomputer centres are offering Japanese colleagues compute time in a show of solidarity. The NSF's Teragrid reports on how its centres are trying to help with the emergency response in Japan by offering supercomputing resources. Keith Baverstock, a radiobiologist at the University of Eastern Finland's Kuopio Campus, has an editorial in the BMJ calling for the health lessons from nuclear accidents to be more thoroughly explored. He doesn't seem impressed with the international response to the Fukushima accident here.India has decided to delay approval of four new reactors, the Wall Street Journal reported today, signalling perhaps a tougher regulatory line. Editorial: Chernobyl 25 years onNotes: Cite this as: BMJ 2011;342:d2443http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d2443.fullLessons have not been learnt and the full public health implications are unknownOn 26 April 1986, a nuclear incident occurred in the then Soviet Union in a place called Chernobyl. Radiological data garnered after the United Kingdom’s Windscale (Sellafield) nuclear incident in 1957 had been used a decade earlier to set emergency reference levels to protect the UK public after such events. [1] These would be used to determine evacuation and food control policies in the immediate aftermath of an incident. In 1979, the Three Mile Island incident in the United States did not pose a threat to the UK, but it was clear in 1986 that Chernobyl might. Unfortunately, not all the UK authorities recognised this possibility, so when Cumbria and southern Scotland received fallout about a week after the incident the state of preparedness was less than optimal—the first radiological assessment appeared 20 days later, [2] but it contained errors that went uncorrected for three years. [3]The situation was much worse closer to Chernobyl: the fallout was serious and extensive, but the Soviet authorities initially denied that an incident had occurred, then acknowledged a small one, and finally—by evacuating more than 100 000 people from their settlements—acknowledged the full seriousness of the situation. Throughout Europe chaos reigned for several weeks: bans on milk were enforced in some places but not others, suspicion of contamination was enough to prevent trade in commodities, and conflicting official advice about travel was rampant. The European Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO/EURO) quickly evaluated the available data to formulate rational risk based advice to member states. In the immediate aftermath a programme was developed recognising the need for harmonisation and rapidity of response. An early visit made to the worst affected areas by Professor Lennart Levi of the Karolinska Institute identified an epidemic of stress related disease attributable to public anxiety. This subsequently became known as the psychosocial effect, [4] and is arguably Chernobyl’s most serious health detriment to date, notwithstanding more than 6000 thyroid cancers in those exposed to iodine-131 as children and more to come. [5] A lack of trusted and timely information in the public domain exacerbates the public health effects of such incidents.The events taking place at Fukushima in Japan over the past weeks are similar to the situation immediately after Chernobyl. Although information abounds, little of it is usable, [6, 7] especially in terms of determining the potential effect on public health, and its truthfulness is doubtful. In the first days the engagement of the international organisations (WHO and the International Atomic Energy Agency) to ensure harmony in response to the incident was notable by its absence, the dedicated Nuclear Emergency Project Office in Helsinki set up in 1998 as part of EURO’s post-Chernobyl response having been closed in 2000.Institutional failure aside, attempts by the international research community to learn and implement the public health lessons of Chernobyl have been less than effective. Although useful information on the sensitivity of a child’s thyroid to iodine-131 has been collected (and stable iodine prophylaxis was used at Fukushima), more knowledge is still needed. [8] Recently, an in-depth review of health related research carried out by experts under the auspices of a European Commission project (Agenda for Research on Chernobyl Health (ARCH); http://arch.iarc.fr) referred to the coverage at the international level as “uncoordinated . . . forming a patchwork rather than a comprehensive, structured attempt to delineate the overall health consequences of the accident.”Looking forward, the ARCH group’s strategic research agenda recommends that a lifespan study—in part bringing together cohorts already under study in the most affected countries, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine—is funded by the European Commission. [9] Latency periods for diseases caused by radiation generally extend from 10 to 60 years, so much could still be learnt and “no evidence of health damage” after comprehensive investigation would be a valuable result.The health implications of Chernobyl have, since the incident occurred, been the “battle ground” for the lobbies for and against nuclear power, which seek to interpret the effects or absence of effects to their own advantage and are apparently unwilling to find the truth. Apart from exacerbating the psychosocial effects on those directly affected, this situation has prevented a comprehensive evaluation of the importance of the event to public health. A determined attempt to “close the Chernobyl book” was made in 2006, which sadly some UN agencies signed up to.[10]Chernobyl can still help us understand the public health consequences of radioactive fallout and the consequent exposure to low doses of ionising radiation over prolonged periods. It represents the other side of the coin from the information gathered from the atomic bombings in Japan in terms of the consequences of exposure to high doses over extremely brief periods. The Japanese and American governments are supporting long term ongoing studies of a lifespan cohort of people who were exposed.Many have been unconvinced by arguments that Chernobyl would be the final nuclear incident, and they have been proved correct. Now it is time to act, both to ensure that the protection of the population exposed to fallout from Fukushima benefits from the experience of Chernobyl, and that the long term health effects of Chernobyl are subject to appropriate and ongoing study.Provenance and peer review: Commissioned; not externally peer reviewed.FootnotesCompeting interests: The author has completed the Unified Competing Interest form at http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf (available on request from the corresponding author) and declares: no support from any organisation for the submitted work; no financial relationships with any organisations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.References↵ Baverstock KF, Vennart J.

The Yomiuri Online news web site reported in Japanese this evening that Toshiso Kosako, a radiation safety expert at the University of Tokyo, feels the standards are too lenient and that his advice has been ignored.On 19 April, the ministry of education announced a ""provisional idea"" for schoolyards contaminated by radiation emanating from the ravaged Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The ministry cited a recommendation by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), based in Ottawa, Canada, that sets an acceptable level of between 1 and 20 millisieverts (mSv) per year for individuals. In its Application of the Commission's Recommendations to the Protection of People Living in Long-term Contaminated Areas After a Nuclear Accident or a Radiation Emergency , ICRP recommendation reads:""The reference level for the optimization of protection of people living in contaminated areas should be selected in the lower part of the 1-20 mSv/year band.""Japan's education ministry figured that children could spend 8 hours a day in a schoolyard with as much as 3.8 microsieverts per hour of radiation and then 16 hours a day inside a building with 1.52 microsieverts per hour and stay within a 20 mSv per year limit. Some 800 groups and 34,000 individuals have signed a petition demanding the withdrawal of the education ministry's 20 mSv per year standard, according to a coalition of citizens' organizations that will present the petition to the government on 2 May.""Setting this (radiation exposure) number for elementary schools is inexcusable,"" says Kosako, according to Yomiuri Online. His resignation is expected to put additional pressure on the government to rethink its decision "

Old plants, though, are a different story.Exelon's proposed acquisition of Baltimore-based Constellation Energy, announced yesterday, would add five nuclear reactors at three plants to the 17 reactors at 10 plants that the Chicago-based company already runs. Exelon's total nuclear capacity would climb from 17,047 megawatts to nearly 19,000 if the projected $7.9 billion deal is completed.......he reason, industry representatives and critics agree, is that the existing plants remain very profitable, even with the decline in electricity prices that followed the market crash and recession in 2008.The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's main trade organization, ranks current nuclear plants as the cheapest source of U.S. electricity, with operating, maintenance and fuel costs of just over 2 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009, compared to 5 cents for electricity from natural gas-fired plants and 3 cents for coal generation. Exelon said its generating plants returned average margins of 3.76 cents per kilowatt-hour last year, despite lower power prices, and two-thirds of Exelon's overall generation capacity comes from nuclear plants.""These [nuclear] plants, which are fully depreciated, were purchased at a discount and are, in fact, cash cows,"" said industry critic Mark Cooper, a senior fellow at Vermont Law School's Institute for Energy and the Environment.<snip .. for details see the article>"

Glad to know and Japan's Health ministry is pretty sure, the seven women will appreciate and be impressed by the statistics of Zero deaths due to the disaster.  OTOH it will be others who may be worried about how any small suboptimal health condition in these seven women will be attributed to the exposure.

1938,Amber G.,01 May 2011 02:32 ,"Also in the news:No significant damage to fuel at unit 4A visual inspection by remote controlled camera has shown no significant damage to the used fuel pond of Fukushima Daiichi unit 4.  There had been fears of serious damage to nuclear fuel stored in the pond after a series of fires and explosions in the vicinity. Highly radioactive and heat-emitting used nuclear fuel is stored for a few years in the ponds before transfer to a larger storage pond shared by all six reactors at the site. However, the reactor was in a period of maintenance with the full core temporarily stored, requiring very much more cooling than the years-old fuel. This contributed to problems at the pond as water heated up and evaporated after the tsunami of 11 March disabled cooling and water top-up systems. At least two fires as well as an explosion occurred in the area of the pond around 15 March, although at that time radiation levels prevented workers from making a direct check on the pond's status. Engineers became worried that the pool had dried out, the fuel overheated and zirconium cladding reacted with water to produce hydrogen, but this visual inspection initially discounts that scenario by showing no serious damage of the kinds that would be expected. Some debris was scattered in the pond as a result of the damage to the building but it is thought that fuel integrity has been maintained. Tokyo Electric Power Company continues to regularly top up the water level in unit 4 as well the others on site. At unit 4 this is done with a concrete pumping truck dubbed an 'elephant' due to its long flexible delivery tube."

Doctors understand these dangers. We work hard to try to save the life of a child dying of leukemia. We work hard to try to save the life of a woman dying of metastatic breast cancer.

They consistently ignore internal emitters — radioactive elements from nuclear power plants or weapons tests that are ingested or inhaled into the body, giving very high doses to small volumes of cells. However, doctors know that there is no such thing as a safe dose of radiation, and that radiation is cumulative. The mutations caused in cells by this radiation are generally deleterious. We all carry several hundred genes for disease: cystic fibrosis, diabetes, phenylketonuria, muscular dystrophy. As we know from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it takes years to get cancer. Leukemia takes only 5 to 10 years to emerge, but solid cancers take 15 to 60. Furthermore, most radiation-induced mutations are recessive; it can take many generations for two recessive genes to combine to form a child with a particular disease, like my specialty, cystic fibrosis. We can’t possibly imagine how many cancers and other diseases will be caused in the far future by the radioactive isotopes emitted by Chernobyl and Fukushima. Well, there is now more unscientific challenge.For many years now, physicists employed by the nuclear industry have been outperforming doctors, at least in politics and the news media.   Physicists had the knowledge to begin the nuclear age. Physicians have the knowledge, credibility and legitimacy to end it.  unless physicians too sell their soul to new clear lobby."

It is quite easy and silly to use phrases like 'pseudo/scientists sold to nuclear industry' to denigrate others, it is more difficult, but useful, to learn some gyan and understand   things which are important to a nation. In any case, NY Times is a reputable newspaper but it also routinely publishes (specially in op-eds) articles from Musharraffs, Pakis, Mishras ityadi ..ityadi.. countless articles about how Indian terrorists are worse than Pakis and other disgusting stuff.So for anyone who has  swayam pragya,  it would be easy to judge the article on its own merit. Don't forget, this Austrailian is the one who calls Indians (and those in Australasian govt who wants to trade Uranium with India) ""Idiots on a pill"".  To me, it does not give a ""heart burn"", more like disgust, very much like zaid hamid's kasab=amar singh type nonsense. What is sad, that BRF members are using her statement to take potshots at people who have used their time and skill to educate aam adami and members of this forum.  Coming back to the author,  she is all over in the media..Here is a clip,   where she says how 1 pound of Pu is enough to kill every one on earth. A theory, almost as credible as Zaid Hamid's Kasab=amarsingh.. (For perspective, from 1950's bomb testing alone, there is TONS of Pu scattered over the earth due to those testing). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKD8QbnoNv4On NYTimes article, she is a little careful and says 'published in NYSA',  other times she routinely calls is NY Science Academy study when she talks about 1,000,000 deaths due to cancer  caused by Chernobyl. (and extrapolates that millions more will die in Fukushima)  What dishonesty! (As , if  an Indian News media interviews and publishes views of Musharraf, she would have attributed it .as ""Indian Media says there are 1000,000,000,000,000 troops killing freedom fighters in Cashmere""...) Also , if you really admire how great this ""If you love this plane"" physician is, read her writings about irresponsible India who 'refuses to sign NPT and ready to start a nuclear war ityadi ityadi..As said before, NO NYSA study has ever endorsed that 1,000,000 number. NYSA gone out of its way to remove the misunderstanding. (see the reference in my previous post). It, however,  will not stop true believers from peddling the same discredited story again and again.. while taking potshots at people who have dedicated their life to understand and educate others.  What a shame!Honestly, this message is not 'tit-for-tat' kind. It will be silly for people to do another == . As said before, Ignorance Kills. It is not good for India.

My own son went to Japan a few weeks ago, and radiation was least  of his (or ours) worries. I don't eat fish (being Jain and all that) but those scientists had no ignorance-caused fear. Not that one does not take radiation seriously... that's why one monitors the level of I and Cs..but a few Bq in spinach is not much more scary than a few Bq in a banana.

1945,Amber G.,01 May 2011 21:46 ,"One well-known  gem from  from Helen Caldicott's article (LA Times a few years ago) - which has become a classic. (Interesting that she is being lionized by some in BRF  )A Friends of the Earth study showed that a nuclear  plant must operate for 18 years before realizing one net calorie of energy.Here are some critiques and letters from other scientists who tried to question the inaccuracies in her articles...I asked Helen Caldicott to respond to the several critical letters about her article in the Los Angeles Times. Like the adversaries ofNapoleon, she is eloquent, but thrives on vagueness. Her claims often don't survive a careful comparison with the facts and she seems to want to avoid a detailed discussion of the disputed points. Rather than defend the original specific points in her article that were disputed by her critics, she chose to attempt to shift attention to other topics, such as their organizational affiliation and herviews on nuclear weapons. Important topics, no doubt, but I would have more respect for her tactics, if she would either admit the errors in her original article or offer a rational defense and explain why her critics are mistaken. ..Her response is basically an appeal to emotions and does little to refute the specific points mentioned by her critics... To see the specific points raised, and utter inaccuracies of here article read, for example:Comments on Caldicott Letter - By Robert Holloway In her response, Helen Caldicott listed several references that she claims support her view that low doses of radiation are ""6 to 8 times more dangerous that originally estimated"".  Let's consider her reference number 3, on the epidemiological study of Rocketdyne workers.  As usual with the scientific claims of Helen Caldicott, the study does not provide strong evidence for her position.  Actually the study showed that Rocketdyne radiation workers had a lower incidence of death from ""all causes"" and alsoa lower incidence of death from cancer, than the U.S. population and also in comparison to other worker groups. Let's consider the actual percentages. Compared to the U.S. population, Rocketdyne radiation workers had a 32% lower death rate from ""all causes"" and a 21% lower death rate from ""all cancers"". Compared to a similar worker control group, Rocketdyne radiation workers had a 38% lower death rate from ""all causes"", and a 11% lower death rate from ""all cancers"". The number of radiation workers from which thesepercentages are derived is over 4,000 which allows a high degree of confidence that the differences are real and not due to chance. or see this:Helen Caldicott confronts her critics without resorting to reasonMichael C. Baker, of Los Alamos, noted that Caldicott claims to be concerned about public health but the clean use of nuclear energy could prevent the thousands of deaths caused by the burning of fossil fuels every year in this country alone. She claims the release of Cesium, Plutonium, and Strontium, will cause thousands if not billions (  ) of painful deaths {won't some one notice if billions had painful death??} , but doesn't explain how these elements would be released. Caldicott responded to Baker, Should I defend myself against attack by members of the nuclear industry from Los Alamos where new and better nuclear bombs are currently being designed for use in third world countries {read India}  now that the Cold War is over? Why is this evil thinking and action countenanced by you people when such weapons would invoke the incineration and vapourisation of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings?Again we have Caldicott attacking persons and institutions, without showing us what is wrong with the argument. She alleges that new bombs are being designed in Los Alamos for use in third world countries. Even if this was true, how does the very fact prove that Baker is wrong? Caldicott simply employes an extended ad hominem fallacy to dispute Baker's criticism.Professor Bernard L. Cohen, a Physicist at the University of Pittsburg criticized Coldicott's alligation that nuclear power does nothing to cut CO2 emissions. According to Cohen, Coldicott misrepresent her sourse, ""it is not supported, as she implies, by the Friends of the Earth (FOE) study she cites."" Cohen also notes that Coldicott also stacks the deck by ignoring important facts, her claim ""is belied by the fact that France, which derives 70% of its electricity from nuclear power, has far lower per capita carbon dioxide releases than any other industrialized nation.It is odd that some have casted her as a heroine and a scientist while posting  her NYTimes article.Just curious, if JwalaMukhi still considers her a heroine...and finds merit in her article."

If the microbiologist/epidemiologist/virologist advises for eg, advises that the method of transmission for a virus is by sneezing/touch and you need to cover your nose & mouth or that it is NOT contagious and that it cannot spread, will a Physician say NO (how will a Physician know about it, unless he reads what the epidemiologist writes about the disease transmission etc in detail?) to what an biologist says and come up with his own theory ?Well, in that case, he/she is not a Physician, but a quack!"

1970,chaanakya,04 May 2011 21:53 ,"TEPCO neglected radiation checks in building where two women absorbed high dosesTokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) failed to check the levels of radiation inside a key operation center at the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant before two female workers were exposed to high levels of radiation there.The two workers have recently been exposed to radiation higher than the legal limit for female workers -- lower than that for men -- of 5 millisieverts over a three-month period. For about two weeks after the March 11 earthquake, the utility did not check the radiation levels inside a special quake-resistant building where the two workers were exposed. About 200 workers use the building on the premises of the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant each day as a base to deal with the ongoing crisis.The building was opened for use in July 2010 as an emergency response base. Located about 200 meters northwest of the No. 1 nuclear reactor, it was built to withstand earthquakes measuring the strongest quakes on the Japanese seven-point scale. However, its structure allows small amounts of radiation to leak through vents. When designing the power plant, the utility had not envisaged the hydrogen explosion that actually damaged the doors of the building and permitted radioactive substances to flow in inside.TEPCO said the delay in preparing a ""buffer area"" where workers were supposed to take off their protective gear was a factor behind its failure to prevent radioactive substances from coming into the building. One of the women in her 50s suffered internal radiation exposure of 13.6 millisieverts (and external exposure of 3.95 millisieverts), while another woman in her 40s had internal exposure of 6.71 millisieverts (and external exposure of 0.78 millisieverts) -- numbers which suggest most of their exposure came from what they inhaled in the building.TEPCO said it had been aware that the levels of radiation inside the building were high. But it then said, ""We initially thought that way because the levels of radiation outside the building were high."" TEPCO started checking the levels of radiation in the building on March 24 -- a day after it stopped female workers from working there.Since then, TEPCO has taken steps such as setting up small rooms equipped with air cleaners at entrances and putting lead sheets over the windows to shut out radiation. TEPCO has also been checking male workers on their internal radiation exposure. Male workers are allowed to be exposed to up to 250 millisieverts of radiation per year.""We should've had workers wear masks earlier. I believe the fact that radioactive substances entered the building after the hydrogen explosion will be an important lesson for us. We want to assess the way TEPCO handled the situation as quickly as possible,"" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency.TEPCO and their supporters , Sankuji what will you do to keep them honest?"

It hopes to install it in the Pacific Ocean near the troubled Fukushima nuclear plant at the end of May.TEPCO says it will fill a metal container with zeolite, a mineral that absorbs radioactive materials. The company will use a pump to continuously inject seawater into the container.Radiation levels have remained high in the waters around the Fukushima plant even after TEPCO managed to plug a leak of contaminated water 4 weeks ago. On Monday, 5,800 times the national limit of radioactive iodine was detected in samples collected near a water intake for the Number 2 reactor.TEPCO says it can't deny the possibility that contaminated water is still leaking and it will continue to closely monitor the situation.The utility has already set up silt fence barriers and thrown sandbags containing zeolite into the sea.It hopes to set up the new device inside a silt fence to decontaminate the seawater.Wednesday, May 04, 2011 02:13 +0900 (JST)Let us remember that Ramana garu talked about Zeolite on this forum first in connection with Fukushima Disaster , even before TEPCO started using it."

You see, that for health effect ""per year"" is really silly as it is the dose which matters.. (at least according to LNT, of other theories as the first order of accuracy). Of course, other matters  (such as which part of the body, age of the person, general health, luck etc) are more important..but saying ""3 mSV /year"" (in stead of 3 mSV) for health effects, shows utter ignorance about science rather than getting ""somewhere"" . IOW,  cancer probability does not depend (according to LNT) whether one gets that 3 mSV dose in a year or a day or an hour. It is the total dose which matters.   Next question is can the time and intensity be linearly scaled for health effects, that is unclear. i.e., if x(intensity) and if y(duration), could they interchange to yield same are similar health effects.  That is unclear.This part will not remain unclear if you go back and see my or others posts (and /or any good reference given in them or by doing your own search.

Fukushima Daiichi 1 yesterday In some ways unit 1 has been the worst hit by the accident sequence started by the tsunami of 11 March. It is thought to have suffered damage to about 55% of the fuel in its core, compared to 35% at unit 2 and 30% at unit 3. It was the first to require venting to control containment vessel pressure and the first to see a hydrogen explosion. It was also the first to be cooled by an emergency method using seawater injection. This basic method continues at units 1 to 3, although fresh water has been used for some time to avoid damaging pumping systems. Tepco had hoped to bring normal systems back into operation within days of reconnecting external power - they had been working normally in the period between the earthquake and tsunami - but has not been able to achieve this so far. Twelve workers re-entered the reactor building of unit 1 yesterday for about 90 minutes and in that time installed four ducts to carry air through an exit to a filtration system, and four more to take it back to another area. With this cycling and filtering of the air, conditions should be more workable within about three days and within about a week Tepco engineers want to begin work on a longer-term circuit for the passage of injected cooling water. The maximum radiation level in the building was about 93 millisieverts per hour, which would have used a large part of the emergency budget of 250 millisieverts overall dose to each worker. Earlier robotic surveys had revealed general radiation dose rates of 10-49 millisieverts per hour across the building, although one area was as high as 1100 millisieverts per hour. "

Mossman, Marvin Goldman, Frank Masse, William A. Mills, Keith J. Schiager, Richard L. VetterIn accordance with current knowledge of radiation health risks, the Health Physics Society recommends against quantitative estimation of health risk below an individual dose of 5 rem(1){50 mSV}  in one year, or a lifetime dose of 10 rem {100 mSV}  in addition to background radiation. Risk estimation in this dose range should be strictly qualitative accentuating a range of hypothetical health outcomes with an emphasis on the likely possibility of zero adverse health effects. The current philosophy of radiation protection is based on the assumption that any radiation dose, no matter how small, may result in human health effects, such as cancer and hereditary genetic damage. There is substantial and convincing scientific evidence for health risks at high dose. Below 10 rem {100 mSv} (which includes occupational and environmental exposures) risks of health effects are either too small to be observed or are non-existent.Current radiation protection standards and practices are based on the premise that any radiation dose, no matter how small, can result in detrimental health effects, such as cancer and genetic damage. Further, it is assumed that these effects are produced in direct proportion to the dose received, i. e., doubling the radiation dose results in a doubling of the effect. These two assumptions lead to a dose-response relationship, often referred to as the linear no-threshold model, for estimating health effects at doses of interest. There is, however, substantial scientific evidence that this model is an oversimplification of the dose-response relationship and results in an overestimation of health risks in the low dose range. Biological mechanisms including cellular repair of radiation injury, which are not accounted for by the linear, no-threshold model, reduce the likelihood of cancers and genetic effects.Radiogenic Health Effects Have Not Been Observed Below 10 Rem {100 mSV}<snip> Edited later: I had the above quote before (March 22).Here is the url of the position paper: (June 2001):http://www.ans.org/pi/ps/docs/ps41.pdf"

So we have to do the work by using some shielding,’’ Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told a press conference.By opening the double-entry doors, air containing about 500 million becquerels of radioactive substances is believed to have been released into the atmosphere from the upper part of the No. 1 reactor building, which was damaged in a hydrogen explosion that occurred at the early days of the nuclear crisis.Seven TEPCO workers and two nuclear regulatory agency officials went into the reactor building around 4:20 a.m. and measured radiation and other conditions inside for about 30 minutes. The nine were exposed to radiation between 2.7 millisieverts and 10.56 millisieverts, the agency said.Under the current plan, TEPCO will fill the No. 1 reactor’s primary containment vessel with water to a level above the nuclear fuel inside, and start operating by June an air-cooling device aimed at reducing the temperature of the water circulating around the reactor.Now that workers have entered the No. 1 reactor building, TEPCO plans to have them install and adjust instruments to measure the water levels in the reactor’s containment vessel, and place a heat exchanger.Restoring the cooling systems of the plant’s reactors, which were lost in the wake of the March 11 quake and tsunami, is seen as vital to end the country’s worst nuclear crisis, as the current emergency measure of continually injecting water from outside has created vast pools of highly radioactive water within the plant.The nuclear agency and"

Fukushima No. 2, which is situated on the Pacific coast about 10 km south of its crippled sister facility, Fukushima No. 1, successfully completed a cold shutdown after being hit by the March 11 quake and tsunami, which temporarily disabled its cooling systems.Because plant manager Tokyo Electric Power Co. faced a severe power shortage in the Kanto region after the disaster, attention is focusing on whether the utility will attempt to restart the four-reactor No. 2 power station.While the final decision rests with the utility, the government has decided to take full account of the feelings of local Fukushima residents, who were forced to evacuate en masse as radiation began leaking from the No. 1 complex, the source said.The decision on whether to restart the No. 2 plant will be put off until the No. 1 power plant is stabilized, according to the source. Tepco said last month it would take at least six to nine months to stabilize the damaged No. 1 complex. This is being told  on brf ever since the tsunami/quake hit Fuk-D-1/2Discussions on the matter could eventually evolve into the possibility of decommissioning No. 2's reactors or keeping them ""suspended"" for an extended period of time, given the deep loss of public trust in nuclear energy since the disaster at the No. 1 plant.The government said it is considering the matter without the premise of resumption, apparently in an attempt to portray itself as putting safety first and economic concerns last."

As the entire nation is earthquake prone, Kan's request is expected to have ramifications for other nuclear plants in coastal areas.The Hamaoka plant has long been the focus of controversy because of predictions by scientists that a huge earthquake could occur at any time. But the plant has continued to operate as the debate has gone on. The predicted Tokai earthquake would be caused by plate movements somewhere off southern Shizuoka Prefecture. Historically, major earthquakes have occurred every 100 to 150 years in the area.Did I hear some chatur ramlingam  telling us that nuke experts  design nuke  plants taking into account the events that take place during last 100-150 years or so?

(Mainichi)ULAN BATOR, Mongolia -- Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the U.S. Department of Energy have secretly been advancing plans to construct the world's first international storage and disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel in Mongolia, it has been learned.The deal would enable Japan and the U.S., which lack disposal sites of their own, to counter efforts by Russia and France to market nuclear technology internationally by selling reactors and the disposal of nuclear waste services together as a set. Parties involved in negotiations acknowledged the secret plans when interviewed by the Mainichi.In return for the deal, Mongolia would receive nuclear power technology from Japan and the U.S. However, the nuclear crisis sparked by the earthquake and tsunami at the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant has pressured the Japanese government to rethink its nuclear power policies, and the move to burden a third party with the task of disposing of nuclear waste is likely to draw criticism.Sources familiar with the plans said negotiations started in late September last year at the initiative of U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman. Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade handled talks, which were facilitated by the fact that there are no immediate prospects of Japan or the U.S. being able to settle on nuclear waste disposal sites of their own and Mongolia wants technological support to construct nuclear fuel processing plants and nuclear fuel storage facilities.Nuclear power generation, which emits little carbon dioxide, is seen as being effective in battling climate change. And the marketing of nuclear plants is big business -- a single reactor sells for hundreds of billions of yen. The Japanese government regards the overseas sale of nuclear power plants as a pillar of the nations' growth strategy. It has already tied a deal with Vietnam and is in negotiations with India and Turkey. However, Russia and other countries have gone a step ahead by marketing their reactors and the collection of spent nuclear fuel together as a set, which has put Japan and the U.S. on the back foot.Japan entrusts the reprocessing of its nuclear fuel to Britain and France. It is working on constructing nuclear reprocessing facilities in the Aomori Prefecture village of Rokkasho, and the village has facilities to temporarily store high-level radioactive waste, but it remains very difficult for the nation to accept spent nuclear fuel from other countries. As the situation stands, the nation's plans to decide on a final disposal site within Japan by 2035 are likely to prove difficult to achieve.The U.S. has also struggled with the issue. In 2002 the administration of former President George W. Bush decided on Nevada as a final disposal site, but in 2009 the administration of President Barack Obama suspended the plans in response to local opposition and the problem has been left up in the air.To make up for their weakness of not being able to receive spent fuel, Japan and the U.S. agreed on the idea of building a storage and disposal facility in Mongolia, which lies on solid ground. The facility would be built several hundred meters below the ground.The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry believes that by materializing the plan, it could support the international nuclear power business of companies such as Toshiba and Hitatchi, which build nuclear reactors.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says that Mongolia may have more than 1.5 million tons of uranium deposits, and if these are developed, the country could rank among the world's top three suppliers of uranium. By promoting the deal with Mongolia, Japan and the U.S. hope to secure a stable supply of uranium.Nuclear waste can be transported internationally if countries through which the fuel is transported and the countries receiving the fuel give their consent, and if methods set by the IAEA and other relevant parties are followed. Negotiations on building the facilities were kept secret as it was feared that if the plans came to light at the negotiation stage, then China and Russia -- countries through which the fuel could pass -- might interfere and protests could erupt from Mongolian residents.In February this year, the three countries were due to sign a comprehensive diplomatic agreement in Washington, but the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which learned of the project shortly beforehand, argued that governmental debate over the project had been insufficient. As a result the signing was put off. After that Japan was struck by the March 11 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, and a date for signing the deal has not yet been determined.Japan's nuclear power plant policies have come under scrutiny since the March 11 disaster, but even if all nuclear power plants in the country were decommissioned, a disposal facility would still be necessary. However, the idea of providing technical support to a third country in return for it accepting nuclear waste could be criticized as an approach similar to Japan's past promotion of the construction of nuclear power plants in Fukushima in return for local funding.Par upadesh Kushal Bahutere."

But the temperature at the bottom of the reactor stood at 150.6 degrees Celsius as of 5 AM Tuesday, marking a rise of 34.1 degrees over the past 10 days.The power company suspects that not all the water was reaching the reactor because some of it may have been entering a pipe that branched off.So it decided to pump water through another pipe that had been used to inject water into the reactor before.The construction work to change pipes for water injection is to begin on Tuesday afternoon. If all goes smoothly, the water will be pumped through the pipe starting on Thursday.The water level inside a tunnel connected to the reactor was 76 centimeters from the tunnel opening on the ground surface as of 7 AM Tuesday--a 16 centimeter rise over the past 10 days.The level continues to exceed the 1 meter mark, which the utility firm has set as the benchmark to begin transferring contaminated water.The firm plans to quickly prepare to transfer contaminated water from the No.3 reactor turbine building and the tunnel.Tuesday, May 10, 2011 12:44 +0900 (JST)"

He also pledged efforts to create a more energy-efficient society.Kan admitted that the government shares responsibility for the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, along with its operator Tokyo Electric Power Company, as the government had promoted nuclear power generation as a national policy.He added he would give up his salary as prime minister until the crisis has ended.Tuesday, May 10, 2011 19:13 +0900 (JST)"

There are 13 commercial reactors in the prefecture.Japan Atomic Power said it will check the emergency core cooling systems (ECCS) and examine fuel assemblies in the core while the No. 2 reactor is down.The check of the ECCS is a reaction to Fukui Governor Issei Nishikawa's call for the plant operator to develop extra safety measures against quakes and tsunami while reactors are offline."

2050,arnab,11 May 2011 10:08 ,"Since we are looking at trends, here is one from China. Do read it all - overwhelming clarity.Meng Si: The Fukushima radiation leak prompted a variety of reactions around the world. In China, a number of government departments stressed that the incident would not change the country’s determination or plans to press ahead with nuclear power. What’s your view?Jiang Kejun: There will be a short term impact, but not a long term one. In the short term, nuclear approvals will slow down, and it could be several months before the current moratorium is lifted. I think the public focus on nuclear power is a good thing – the Fukushima incident has brought everything out into the open, helping everyone to develop a better understanding of the energy they use. In the end, people will realise that nuclear power is the safest energy source.MS: How do you reach that conclusion?[/b]JK: [b]It’s not my conclusion – you only need to look at the data. The Japanese government is extremely conscientious, and if we haven’t yet been told of workers suffering radiation exposure on a large scale, then it hasn’t happened.The Three Mile Island accident in the United States caused very few deaths, some illnesses. There are huge variations in the figures for Chernobyl: the International Atomic Energy Agency says fewer than 50 people had died [by 2005] as a result of the incident, while some environmental groups put the figure at 90,000 or even well over 100,000. But even if you use the higher figures, when you average it out, nuclear power is still extremely safe. I remember a report by a journalist who, after researching nuclear power in depth, came to the conclusion that it was the only source of energy he could trust, because it has the strictest approval and monitoring standards. It’s like trains and planes – you’re much less likely to die on a plane, but when there is an air crash it gets lots of attention. Compare nuclear power with other energy sources. When it comes to chronic diseases, coal is the worst. Mining disasters aside, each year sees more than a thousand cases of silicosis, and the numbers get even worse if you add in related cancer cases. There are issues like this with all fossil fuels. Even around Fukushima, the radiation impact is limited. Some of the numbers might sound bad, but the situation is still some way from the worst case scenario.MS: There is a view that if this can happen even in cautious Japan, then there is a huge question mark over China’s nuclear management. What would you say to that?JK: The technology Japan uses is somewhat outdated, while the nuclear technology now being used in China is the most advanced in the world. When the Daya Bay plant was built, with extensive safety measures, it was the best in the world. I think the problems in Japan have more to do with where the authorities decided to locate the plant in the first place than whether Japan was or wasn’t careful. And actually it’s not just Japan – globally, those deciding the location for major projects often fail to take into account all sorts of factors. For example, dams in China are thought to be designed to withstand the sort of disaster that only occurs once every few centuries. But the 9.0 magnitude earthquake in Japan shows just how hard it is to predict the severity of such an event. When we talk about nuclear safety, it’s important to remember that it’s essentially a technological matter, and that standards for the nuclear industry are among the highest of any industry in China. China’s nuclear technology can be said to be very safe. MS: But isn’t that based on a relative concept of safety? As our knowledge increases, isn’t it true that what is considered safe today might not be in the future?[/b]JK: It is a relative concept, yes, but personally I’m in favour of nuclear power. It isn’t that I particularly like nuclear, but I like coal and hydropower less because the problems with those energy sources are bigger. And even wind power, for example, which is widely considered a clean technology, can also have a negative impact on birds and ecosystems.[b]Today there are many NGOs opposing nuclear power, but they don’t have the data to support their position. Nobody wants accidents to happen, but what else are we going to use if not nuclear power? If you look at the whole process, fatalities caused by nuclear power per unit of electricity generated are one hundredth those caused by hydropower, and about one twentieth those caused by coal power – and that’s just fatalities, the differences in other areas can be even larger. MS: Why do you think the public were so alarmed by the Fukushima accident?[/b]JK: [b]I think the media performed badly in this case. First, they failed to go out and get the basic facts about nuclear power. To discuss this subject, you need a very strong technical background – you can’t just talk about it in the same terms as anything else. But at the start, journalists just repeated what they heard, throwing in all sorts of different opinions, and the reports made the situation sound terrifying. The average member of the public is unable to differentiate between them.One error, at the very start, was that it was often reported that radiation levels were “10,000 times” over the legal limit. Actually they weren’t, they were 10,000 times higher than background radiation levels. What does that mean? The media didn’t explain that, in Tokyo and where the plant is located, background radiation is 0.04 microsieverts, and so 10,000 times is 400 microsieverts. Just compare that with the radiation caused by an X-ray. [One X-ray causes exposure of 1,000 microsieverts, according to the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention].In fact, radiation levels around nuclear-power stations tend to be comparatively low – levels of radioactive substances around coal-fired power plants are 10 times or more those near nuclear plants. Europe has plenty of money and doesn’t want to use coal. Have any of these anti-nuclear environmental groups asked people whether they would be more willing to live near a nuclear-power plant or a coal-fired one? Personally, I would opt for nuclear.So when the media reports these sorts of stories, they need to think about their own role and responsibilities, acquire the necessary background knowledge and provide the public with accurate information. MS: Disregarding government subsidies, what are the market prices for nuclear, coal and hydropower, and what will the future trends be?[/b]JK: [b]Currently nuclear power doesn’t really need to be subsidised. The order of expense is: photovoltaic solar power as the most expensive, then offshore wind, onshore wind, natural gas, nuclear, coal and hydropower. The costs of nuclear already include waste handling and safety management.Coal will become more expensive in the future, due to pollution issues – nitrogen and sulphur scrubbers will be needed in power plants. There won’t be much change in nuclear-power prices, though the cost of the safer third-generation reactors are likely to fall by about 20%. There is huge potential for solar power to get cheaper, maybe by 50% over the next 10 to 20 years. However, there is not much scope for wind power to get cheaper – by the end of 2010 it had already fallen to a little over 3,000 yuan (US$462) per kilowatt. MS: Does handling nuclear waste account for much of the cost of nuclear power? There is public concern that this will turn into a permanent burden. JK: Nuclear-waste storage today is very safe. There are still some problems that need to be worked out, but they are all within a controllable and acceptable range. Fourth-generation nuclear reactors will increase fuel usage rates by several dozen times and at that point very little waste will be produced. Actually, we are already capable of processing nuclear waste, it’s just the cost is high, and so we store it. MS: Germany has announced closure of seven nuclear power plants and many expected a power shortage – but no large scale power cuts seem to have happened. JK: Since the shutdown, many industrial sectors have complained that this is a blow for them. Germany is already preparing to import coal from the United States, which is tantamount to exporting pollution and fatalities to a different country. I think Germany has not made a wise choice, and in the long term, this will damage the competitiveness of the nation as a whole.http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/sh ... le/en/4281"

(Fifty-four reactors currently supply about a quarter of Japan's electrical energy needs - this 'Nuclear landscape' graphic shows where they are).Japan's energy mix - and the plan it's just scrapped.That pre-Fukushima enthusiasm for nuclear, as Nature’s reporter Jeff Tollefson explained in his April examination of the country’s energy policy (‘Japan faces power struggle’), was because it seemed the best way to reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports, and to meet the country’s ambitious goals to cut carbon emissions – 25% from 1990 levels by 2020, and 80% by 2050.According to the Guardian, Kan said Japan would have to compile its new energy policy in a report for the International Atomic Energy Agency in June. The prime minister didn’t provide any details, but said the country needed to look more at renewable energy (like solar, wind, and biomass), and on conserving energy – though Japan’s streamlined economy is already among the most energy-efficient in the world.The New York Times notes that the energy review is “the second time that Mr. Kan has suddenly announced big changes in Japanese nuclear policy without the usual endless committee meetings and media leaks that characterize the country’s consensus-driven decision making.”Last week, Kan requested that the Hamaoka nuclear plant be shut down; after which utility Chubu Electric Power suspended operations at the plant, which sits in an area considered overdue for a large earthquake.Kan also said he was preparing for a commission that would undertake an “independent, open and comprehensive” investigation into the Fukushima disaster, and added that, from June, he would return his prime ministerial salary until there was prospect of a resolution at Fukushima.

Japan to shut down ‘dangerous’ Hamaoka nuclear reactors - May 09, 2011http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/05/japan_to_shut_down_dangerous_h_1.htmlJapan is to shut down a nuclear power station branded the world’s most dangerous, despite fears that the closure could affect local industry.The Hamaoka plant in Omaezaki, south-west of Tokyo, sits near a major fault line and concern about the plant has spiked in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. Japan’s prime minister Naoto Kan last week said there was an 87% chance of an 8.0 quake in the area in the next 30 years, and requested that owners Chubu Electric shut down reactors at the site.Today the company said it would stop the operation of reactors 4 and 5 at Hamaoka. Reactor 3 was already closed and operation will not be resumed, it added. Reactors 1 and 2 were already shut down.Restarting the reactors will wait at least until the company has built additional defences against natural disaster, including a sea wall.The Hamaoka plants supply much of the electricity to the local region and some are worried that power outages stemming from the shut down could affect production in Japan’s industrial sector.“This news is triggering uncertainty not just about Chubu Electric, but the whole utility sector,” Yoshinori Nagano, a senior strategist at Daiwa Asset Management, told the BBC. “Investors are concerned that on the back of this news, other reactors currently under inspection may not resume operations soon.”Japan’s government may step in to compensate Chubu, which has already warned that the plant closure could hit its finances hard (Reuters 1, Reuters 2)."

The situation changed in 1973 when Oil crisis plunged Japan in deep energy trouble. Their plants were mostly relied on Oil imports. At that point they decided to go for Nuclear Power.With time lot of restrictions were relaxed and plants came up in areas where it should not have come.The corporate-govt lobby nexus is very strong there and Govt can not survive without their support. Top level is always mired in scandals and changes are too often. Nato Kan would not survive once this crisis is over. Public opinion  seems to be gaining ground against Nuclear power but too early to say if TEPCO and other companies would not try to resuscitate despite odds.So it is too early to say if Japanese would follow East or West. I think despite all westernization they are deeply Asian and religious and remember history, proud of that as well."

2072,chaanakya,11 May 2011 20:29 ,"TEPCO seeks public funds to help pay damages billThe Yomiuri ShimbunTokyo Electric Power Co. President Masataka Shimizu on Tuesday asked the government for financial support to help the utility make compensation payments for damage caused by the ongoing crisis at its Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.Shimizu visited the Prime Minister's Office in the morning and lodged a formal written request for financial assistance.In talks with top government officials, Shimizu explained the utility's restructuring plan in an attempt to win support from the government.Shimizu proposed eight TEPCO executives, including Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata and himself, be required to forgo all remuneration for the time being.""Although as a prerequisite [for government support] we have to maximize our cost-cutting efforts, we hope the government will support us,"" Shimizu said in a meeting with government officials, including Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano and Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Banri Kaieda.TEPCO's written request stated that as a result of the nuclear crisis, the utility would depend more heavily on thermal electric power generation this fiscal year, which would cost the company close to 1 trillion yen in additional fuel and other expenses.The document also said TEPCO would have to raise about 750 billion yen to redeem corporate bonds it has issued and to repay some of its debt.Shimizu asked the government to swiftly map out a framework for providing financial support to TEPCO.""It's a matter of time until we run short of money, and that could adversely affect not only our payment of compensation but also our efforts to ensure a stable power supply,"" he said.The president said TEPCO would raise as much funds on its own as possible by selling assets, including marketable securities and real estate.As for the salaries of executive directors, Shimizu said the firm would slash them by 60 percent, rather than 50 percent.Kaieda told reporters Tuesday: ""We were informed about TEPCO's detailed self-restructuring plan. But there are several more [points] we want TEPCO to include.""The government is hammering out an outline for the compensation plan, and Kaieda said the draft might be finished by Friday.===Govt may acquire stockThe government may acquire shares of Tokyo Electric Power Co. so as to increase its involvement in the utility's management in connection with its compensation payments to those affected by the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant accident, a high-ranking government official has told The Yomiuri Shimbun.By holding TEPCO's stock and carrying out a management reshuffle, the government aims to oversee the implementation of the compensation payments.To be specific, a new institution, which the government is considering establishing to deal with the compensation payments, would underwrite the utility's new shares to be issued in the form of preferred stock.Under this scenario, the government will acquire the right to have the preferred stock converted into common stock with voting rights in the future.The government held a meeting to discuss the framework of the compensation payments on Monday, for the fourth day in a row. As there has been a succession of critical voices raised over the inadequate efforts of corporate restructuring by TEPCO, the meeting failed to reach a consensus.Should the decision on the framework of TEPCO's compensation payments be put off further, some fear it could trigger credit insecurity in the utility and may bring about ill effects on the stock and corporate bond markets. By having the state get involved in TEPCO's management, it may be able to fend off this credit uneasiness.(May. 11, 2011)"
2073,chaanakya,11 May 2011 20:36 ,"Suspension of Hamaoka nuke plant sparks battle between common sense and outdated thinkingThe suspension of operations at the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant in Shizuoka Prefecture, which is widely regarded as vulnerable to a powerful earthquake and tsunami, will adversely affect production and employment in central Japan. Moreover, the move will certainly contribute to public opinion against nuclear power generation and spark demands that other nuclear power stations be also closed.However, is the decision to shut down the plant really a reckless move? Rather, calls for the continued consumption of electric power by all means should be called irresponsible.Nearly 100,000 residents near the tsunami-hit Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant have been evacuated from their hometowns and deprived of their jobs, and are at a loss what to do. Those who are remaining in their neighborhoods around the plant fear possible contamination of the air, water and soil from radiation leaking from the crippled plant.Agricultural products from Fukushima and fish caught off the prefecture are not selling well because groundless rumors that such products are contaminated with radiation have spread throughout the country. Moreover, the nuclear reactors at the plant are still out of control.The accident at the Fukushima plant is very different from the Chernobyl nuclear crisis. The Chernobyl accident occurred while nuclear fission was under way but the Fukushima crisis took place after nuclear fission had been stopped.The Fukushima accident is merely the result of the inability to remove the remaining heat from nuclear fuel. However, this remaining heat has caused such a serious crisis.Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), the operator of the plant, claims that it can place the power station under control if the external electric power grid to cool down the reactors is restored. TEPCO and the government's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) share the view that the biggest lesson learned from the crisis at the Fukushima plant is that the loss of external power sources to cool down reactors can cause such a serious situation.In the meantime, the public has learned another lesson from the accident -- how much damage can be caused by radioactive waste generated at nuclear power plants and the difficulties in bringing such troubled power stations under control. These issues had been common knowledge among those opposing nuclear power plants, but only became widely known to the public following the accident.A documentary film titled, ""Into Eternity,"" about a final radioactive waste burial facility in Finland called ""Onkalo,"" is now being screened in Japan. It was released following the crisis without any prior advertising, but theaters where the film is being shown are full almost every day -- a far stronger reaction than its distributor had expected.Onkalo is the only final radioactive waste disposal facility under construction in the world. Finland, which relies heavily on Russia for energy, needs nuclear power plants, and public consensus has been formed on the need to build a permanent nuclear waste burial site.However, it will take 100,000 years before high-level radioactive waste becomes harmless. No structure has lasted for such a long period. No one can guarantee that the burial site will never be damaged by war, crustal changes or floods.Moreover, the advancement of civilization and languages hundreds of years into the future is beyond people's imagination. The film raises questions on how people can tell their children and grandchildren about the risks that buried radioactive waste poses to the environment and whether the project is feasible or not.Japan is pursuing a nuclear fuel cycle and a method for the final treatment of waste generated in that process, but has been unable to draw a clear roadmap toward that end. Japan is far more irresponsible than Finland in that its prospects for treating radioactive waste are unclear. Still, it has been generating a massive amount of nuclear waste. One cannot help but wonder whether Japan's practice is justifiable.It is true that Prime Minister Naoto Kan's announcement that the government would ask Chubu Electric Power Co. to stop operating the Hamaoka plant came very suddenly. Some political analysts describe Kan's actions as a populist performance while others call it a surprise move aimed at containing his political foes. However, these comments fail to get to the heart of the issue.The point here is the tug-of-war between those who aim to continue generating and using electric power by all means and those who are attempting to change the trend of the times.Everybody knows it would be unrealistic to immediately stop all nuclear power plants. Nevertheless, it is unjustifiable to demand that the operation of the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant continues because there are also other dangerous nuclear power stations in Japan. The operation of all other dangerous nuclear power plants should be restricted from a mid-term perspective.It is a battle between the common sense of those who look straight at the crisis in Fukushima Prefecture and review Japan's reliance on nuclear power generation and the outdated thinking of those who disregard the plight of Fukushima residents and want to continue the current energy policy merely by force of habit.

2074,chaanakya,11 May 2011 20:49 ,"Disastrous pattern of academic-gov't collusion must not be allowed to continueI am struck with a sense of deja vu as the crisis at the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant continues. National policy founded on a thirst for economic growth that has put the interests of industry first, and actions taken by politicians who have only lent their ears to experts whose views support their goals, has caused much irreparable damage over the years. If this destructive chain of action is not stopped, we are bound to face further tragedy.A group of 16 pro-nuclear scientists led by a former president of the Atomic Energy Society of Japan (AESJ) and former members of the Nuclear Safety Commission (NSC) of Japan held a press conference on April 1. In it, they said that the amount of radioactive material stored in the reactors at the Fukushima plant far exceeds that which was stored at Chernobyl, and that even if we are to avoid immediate dangers, the Fukushima plant would require close monitoring for many years to come. These remarks, which were coming not from anti-nuclear activists but from pro-nuclear experts, were evidence that nuclear energy proponents were finally acknowledging the seriousness of the current situation.It was 14 years ago that Kobe University professor emeritus and seismologist Katsuhiko Ishibashi wrote a paper warning of the possibility of a nuclear accident, like the current one, triggered by a massive quake or tsunami. In the May issue of the monthly magazine Sekai, Ishibashi mentions how NSC Chair Haruki Madarame and Toshisho Kosako -- a radiation expert and professor at the University of Tokyo who resigned from his post as a senior nuclear advisor to the government on April 30 over the government's handling of the crisis -- reacted to his paper at the time.{not unlike what we see here and still some want to call it black swan event, probably they are in love with the phrase}According to Ishibashi, Madarame disputed the various concerns that were raised, and characterized Ishibashi as a nuclear layperson, saying, ""We've never heard of Ishibashi at the AESJ."" Kosako also lambasted Ishibashi's claims, saying, ""There is absolutely no possibility of massive amounts of radiation being released... When publishing papers, it is common for academics to be cautious about covering subjects on which they lack expertise. In his paper, Ishibashi makes unfounded statements about a topic outside his specialty."" {similar to responses we see here}There are countless examples of seals of approval given to scientists' views that support the implementation of government policy, while those challenging the government are dismissed and silenced.Take the case of Minamata disease. In 1956, a research team at Kumamoto University determined that the disease afflicting local residents was caused by ingesting heavy metals that had accumulated in seafood from Minamata Bay. Three years later, a research team at the then Ministry of Welfare compiled a report concluding that the disease was caused by eating seafood tainted with methylmercury.The government, however, citing scientists who offered various theories on the cause of the disease, including spoiled fish, refused to acknowledge that environmental pollution was the culprit. This allowed chemical company Chisso Corp.'s acetaldehyde factory to continue releasing toxic effluvia into local waters, while Minamata Bay area residents continued to eat poisoned fish, giving rise to an explosion of Minamata Disease patients. In 1965, a similar factory operated by Showa Denko Corp. in Niigata Prefecture caused a ""second Minamata Disease crisis.""The government officially admitted in September 1968 that the disease was caused by methylmercury, but by then factories similar to the ones in Kumamoto and Niigata were already obsolete and out of operation. In other words, Minamata disease was recognized as the cause of the tragedy only after industry no longer had any use for the factories emitting the toxins.The time when asbestos contamination was making headlines all over the country fits the same pattern. The Environment Ministry appointed an academic to chair an asbestos health hazard committee -- an academic found later to have served as an advisor to the Japan Asbestos Association for 13 years, during which time he'd questioned restrictions on asbestos use in a promotional video. He subsequently stepped down from the committee post.{some scientists having incestuous relationship is not a news, we heard how one scientist did research to help company against claims of coal miners and in the process he also found radon raidation had no effect or omething like that, why do we trust such interested parties?}It was also not too far in the past that major public works projects such as the construction of a small dam at the mouth of the Nagara River and the Isahaya Bay reclamation project were promoted by the government citing backing of experts who claimed the environmental impacts of such projects would be ""minimal,"" only to see major destruction being wreaked on the ecosystem. { there are experst who will always GUBO for petty benefits and compromise public trust posed in them}The crisis we currently face with the Fukushima power plant is the direct result of the collusive relationship between industry, government and academia.Mitsuhiko Tanaka, a science journalist and former nuclear engineer, points out in Sekai that based on data of the Fukushima plant's water levels and pressure, it is possible the No. 1 reactor lost its coolant due to quake damage to pipes in the pressure vessel. {there are few here who hold that plant survived quake, full facts are yet to emerge}Tanaka also speculates that the reason for the explosion at the No. 2 reactor after hydrogen accumulated near the pressure suppression pool at the bottom of the reactor building -- despite the gas being lighter than oxygen -- is that hydrogen leaked into the pool through pressure-suppression pipes, and was released through cracks in the pool caused by the quake, eventually reacting with surrounding oxygen.In other words, Tanaka believes the nuclear reactor had suffered major damage even before the tsunami hit. While nothing has been done to verify or dispel such possibilities, there already have been murmurs within the industrial community that Japanese nuclear power plants will be safe as long as anti-tsunami measures are implemented.Are we going to maintain our dependence on nuclear energy? Are we going to stop the nuclear reactors beginning with the riskiest ones, or get rid of them all at once? It is time for every Japanese citizen to ask themselves these questions and take action. By now, we know all too well how dangerous it is to leave these questions to government.

2076,chaanakya,11 May 2011 20:56 ,"Gov't, experts must release criteria for radiation safety around nuke plantUniversity of Tokyo Professor Toshiso Kosako is pictured during a press conference held at the Diet building on April 29, 2011, following his resignation as a special nuclear advisor to the Cabinet. (Mainichi)""Resigning was the worst choice, wasn't it?"" says an e-mail I received from one of my colleagues late last week. It referred to the resignation of University of Tokyo professor and radiation expert Toshiso Kosako as an adviser to the Cabinet Secretariat.Kosako tearfully criticized the government for what he calls its ""lax"" response to the crisis at the tsunami-hit Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant when he announced his departure at a news conference. My colleague fears that Kosako's abrupt and emotional announcement could fuel local residents' concern about radiation leaks from the crippled power station.There are two kinds of health hazards that radioactive material can cause -- immediate tissue damage from high levels of radiation, and chromosomal damage that increases the risk of cancer in the future even if the amount of radioactive material is small.Radiation in areas dozens of kilometers away from the plant is far below the level that could immediately damage tissues. Therefore, the government asserts that the radiation ""will not pose an immediate threat to human health.""On the other hand, if people are exposed to even a small amount of radiation, experts say it will slightly increase the risk of cancer in the future. Children in particular are vulnerable to radioactive substances. This is what residents of Fukushima Prefecture are worried about.However, if children living in Fukushima Prefecture suffer from cancer in the future, it will be impossible to prove a causal relationship between their exposure to radiation and the disease. Even experts are divided over whether and how far the Chernobyl nuclear crisis will affect the health of nearby populations from a long-term perspective. In short, health hazards that radiation can cause have not been clarified.We need to consider how to deal with such a slight rise in health hazards caused by radiation, but there is too little information available to make that judgment.Professor Kosako voiced objections to the government's repeated assertions that the situation is safe. However, his warning that the situation is dangerous without showing clear evidence also fuels the public's anxiety.Both the government and experts like Kosako are required to show the public clear criteria for judging whether the situation is safe or dangerous. It is Fukushima Prefecture residents, rather than Kosako, who really want to cry over the ongoing nuclear crisis. (By Etsuko Nagayama, Tokyo Science and Environment News Department)"

A researcher who had spent many years studying nuclear power said, ""The fact is no one really knows what's going on inside the Fukushima nuclear reactors."" According to that researcher, it's possible that a great deal of the nuclear fuel in the reactors has already melted, which would mean the situation is even more serious than what the Tokyo Electric Power Co. has reported.In response to that researcher's comments, a politician speaking for the government said, ""I wish you wouldn't say things on television that could make people needlessly worried."" Indeed, I think we should avoid doing things that make people watching television feel needlessly anxious or afraid.However, was the worry the politician referred to really ""needless""? Among our worries, are there not sometimes ones that we cannot avoid confronting, or that are even necessary to our lives?"

The utility also says it detected 1.5 milli-sieverts per hour of radiation on the surface of water in the pit, which indicates contaminated water may be leaking into the sea.TEPCO is investigating the make-up of the water and considering burying the pit to stop possible leakage.On April 2nd, the utility confirmed that highly radioactive wastewater was leaking into the sea from a crack in a pit outside the No.2 reactor.That leak was stopped 4 days later, after workers sealed the crack with a special chemical known as liquid glass.

Japan currently has the third largest solar PV capacity installed, generating slightly more electricity than geothermal, but only rates fifth in terms of installation per capita. In 2008, according to Reuters, Japan produced 1.92 million kilowatts of solar power, of which 80% came from people's homes.Though Japan's environment minister said on Tuesday that the Pacific coast of northeast Japan was suited for wind installation, and could eventually generate the more power than is currently being produced by the nation's nuclear plants, severe weather, grid constraints and economic stagnation have been holding this renewable back.Japan has the third largest geothermal energy potential in the world after the U.S. and Indonesia. But in terms of harnessing that heat and turning it into power, Japan only ranks 8th, after countries with drastically smaller populations, like Iceland and New Zealand.Yes there are issues, but where are there no issues? This is a very good way forward."

But it's a nice tactic on a thread where most people don't have the time to actually click on the link and read through and depend on the poster to highlight the important portions.This is also from the article.Last year, Kan's government announced plans to build 14 new reactors that would expand that production to meet 50% of the nation's electricity needs. Japan is world's third largest consumer of electricity, and, as the largest importer of liquified natural gas and coal and third largest consumer of oil, has long relied on non-domestic fossil fuels for the majority of its electricity production. In an island nation without its own natural resources or space, nuclear seemed like the right way forward in order for Japan to distance itself from the volatility of the oil markets and to meet its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% of 1990 levels by 2020.The government has not yet backed down from that target, but it is certainly one of the things that will now be up for debate in forging a brand new energy policy. Kan, in sentiments later echoed by Environment Minister Ryu Matsumoto, said that new direction would focus on other renewables like wind, solar, hydro and geothermal, and conservation.Being up for debate is not the same as announcing a stop or step back from nuclear. Note there's no mention of not building those 14 new plants or closing down the existing 54 plants (save of course Fukushima). Or even news that such a move would be considered.Japan is going to invest more on renewables, that's really good news. But it's the third largest electricity consumer in the world and needs a lot of energy. The day when the actually announce the cutting back or scraping of nuclear power plants will be the day to sit up and take notice, IMO."

So the water level is really low but the rods have already collected at the very bottom and are hence just about covered. Wonder how long this dangerous balance can last?

Hamaoka powers regions that include Aichi, home to Toyota Motor Corp headquarters. Hamaoka is the only plant so far where the government has asked that operations be halted until the utility can implement safety measures. Chubu Electric has already drawn up plans to build a 40 to 50 foot seawall along a mile long stretch off the Pacific coast. But completion of that wall is expected to take about three years. The inspection of Hamaoka and all of Japan's 54 nuclear plants was prompted by the disaster at the troubled Fukushima Daichi nuclear plant following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The Japanese are doing what any democratic country with concern for its people would do. Taking a step back and re looking at safety measures and enhancing them as in the case of Hamaoka.To infer from that they are shutting down all the nuclear plants permanently takes a particular kind of leap in faith."

2096,chaanakya,12 May 2011 21:38 ,"Nuclear fuel at Fukushima No. 1 reactor melted after full exposureThursday 12th May, 02:38 PM JST TOKYO —Water inside the troubled No. 1 reactor of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was at an unexpectedly low level, not enough to cover the nuclear fuel, hinting that a large part of the fuel melted after being fully exposed, Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Thursday based on data obtained by adjusted gauges.But the plant operator said the water at the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel holding the fuel is keeping the melted fuel cool, assuring that the company is succeeding in preventing the reactor’s fuel from overheating by injecting water from outside.Based on the latest data after workers adjusted gauges for measuring the water level at the reactor, water could not be confirmed inside the pressure vessel at a point 5 meters below where the top of the 4-meter-long fuel rods normally are, according to TEPCO.The water level is far lower than earlier thought. Measurements taken before the gauge adjustment indicated that about 1.5 to 1.7 meters of the fuel rods were exposed and not submerged in water.Still, the surface temperature of the pressure vessel was relatively low, measuring between 100 C and 120 C.The utility had earlier estimated that 55% of the reactor core at the No. 1 unit has been damaged. It is unknown how much fuel melted and dropped to the bottom, but the fuel is unlikely to be at its original position.TEPCO has been trying to check the levels of water inside the No. 1 reactor’s pressure vessel and the outer primary container so that it can move ahead with a plan to flood the container with water up to the level above the fuel and create a system to stably keep the fuel cool.But the latest finding on the situation inside the unit—one of the six at the plant crippled by the March 11 massive quake and tsunami—suggests that a significant amount of the water injected into the reactor core to keep the fuel cool as an emergency measure was leaking out to the primary container.A TEPCO official said the company will review its plan to flood the primary container up to the level above the fuel.Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the government’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said even if the container is not flooded with water, creating a system that would enable coolant to circulate around the reactor is possible by using the water that now exists inside the vessel and primary container."

It's now been revealed that contaminated water levels in the No. 3 reactor's turbine building were already alarmingly high by Sunday.Tokyo Electric Power Company plugged the leak with concrete after it found highly radioactive water flowing into the sea through a pit.Radioactive cesium 620,000 times higher than the government-set safety limit was detected from the leaked water.The contaminated water was streaming from the outlet of a pipe for electric cables.The leak is thought to have stemmed from pooled water in the turbine building of the No. 3 reactor.TEPCO says it found that waste water levels in the facility had risen to a point where leakage was feared on Sunday.The company says it doesn't know when the leak began, but that it will investigate if the monitoring of water levels was appropriate. The problem raises the question of whether the utility wasn't able to prevent the latest leak.The utility is planning to soon begin transferring radioactive water accumulated in the turbine building to a provisional storage facility. It is now checking for other possible leaks.Highly radioactive water poured into the sea from a crack in a pit outside the No.2 reactor in early April.On Thursday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the renewed leaking of radioactive materials into the sea was extremely regrettable.He says the government apologizes to the local residents, the fishing industry and neighboring countries.Edano also said he had instructed TEPCO to investigate how the leak occurred, and that the company must take measures to prevent another episode.Thursday, May 12, 2011 13:09 +0900 (JST)"

2099,chaanakya,12 May 2011 21:46 ,"Water likely leaking from No.1 reactorTokyo Electric Power Company says water may be leaking from breaches in the No.1 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, causing a sharp drop in the water level inside the reactor.Tokyo Electric sent workers inside the building to adjust the water gauge of the reactor.The utility had suspected the gauge wasn't working properly because the water level hasn't been rising despite pumping in 150 tons of water daily to cool the reactor.On Thursday morning, it was found that the water level was more than one meter below the bottom of the fuel rods, suggesting a large volume of water is leaking into the containment vessel.The utility company also believes that the water is leaking from the containment vessel into the reactor building. This is because the estimated volume of water inside the containment vessel appears to be less than what leaked into it from the reactor.Tokyo Electric says temperatures at the bottom of the reactor are between 100 and 120 degrees Celsius, suggesting that the fuel has fallen and is being cooled in the water below.The utility says it does not believe the fuel has completely melted and spilled through the bottom of the reactor. It adds that instead, the fuel appears to be being cooled inside the reactor.Tokyo Electric says the company will now have to review its ongoing procedure of filling the containment vessel with water to cool the reactor.It says it will reveal a new plan on Tuesday next week when it is set to announce a revised schedule for containing the emergency.Work to cool the reactors had made the most progress in the No.1 reactor, with the volume of injected water being increased. The cooling of the reactors is the most important step in the containment process.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters that the reactor appears to be stable because it's been steadily cooled for a long period. But he said the condition of the reactor must be reassessed as some figures from the gauge are contradictory.The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said that if the latest data is accurate, it seems parts of the fuel have melted and accumulated at the bottom of the reactor. But it added that it believes the fuel rods are being cooled.Thursday, May 12, 2011 15:08 +0900 (JST)"

They are currently undergoing regular inspections or plan to be inspected soon.Later this week Chubu Electric Power Company will shut down 2 of its reactors at the Hamaoka plant. The move follows a government request to do so, due to concerns about the plant's earthquake readiness.All told, 35, or about two-thirds, of Japan's commercial reactors will have been shut down by the end of May.During the next few months, 5 more reactors will have to be shut down ahead of regular inspections.If the utilities decide to keep these 40 reactors offline for the time being, Japan will have about 75 percent of its reactors shutdown this summer.Thursday, May 12, 2011 18:28 +0900 (JST)"

Earlier in the day, it said the amount of water inside the troubled reactor was unexpectedly low -- not enough to cover the nuclear fuel -- hinting that a large part of the fuel melted after being fully exposed.The finding is raising concerns that the company will face difficulty achieving its plan to bring the damaged reactors to a stable condition known as a ''cold shutdown'' in about six to nine months, observers said."
2103,chaanakya,12 May 2011 22:07 ,"Local concerns could delay nuclear operations throughout JapanMunicipalities hosting nuclear power plants are now so nervous about potential accidents that 42 of Japan's 54 commercial reactors could be offline during the peak electricity demand period this summer.That situation could lead to power outages spreading throughout Japan.Electric power companies are not legally bound to gain the approval of local communities before resuming reactor operations. However, the companies have signed safety agreements with prefectural and municipal governments that make it difficult to resume operations without their consent.Considering the protracted problems at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, local governments are now opposing such plans..............................Fukui Prefecture has 13 commercial nuclear plants, the most in the nation. Operations at six have been been suspended for inspections and three others will halt operations for inspections in July.Eight reactors in Fukui Prefecture have been operating for more than 30 years. The prefectural government has asked the central government for measures to deal with such old reactors.Regular inspections are required at nuclear reactors about once a year. Operations of 14 reactors have been halted for such inspections. Seven were scheduled to restart by late April, but electric power companies have yet to pull the switch.Six other reactors are scheduled to undergo regular inspections by this summer. And 15 reactors are not operating because they were damaged by the March 11 Great East Japan Earthquake.If the 42 reactors are shut down in the summer, it would deprive Japan of about 20 percent of total electricity now generated.One reason for the delay in resuming operations is that the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) has asked for emergency safety measures in light of the accident at the Fukushima No. 1 plant."

The areas measured were divided into 1- to 2-square-kilometer zones.According to the map, about 800 square kilometers are contaminated with accumulated cesium-137 of 600,000 becquerels or higher per square meter.

2105,chaanakya,12 May 2011 22:15 ,"Kan slams nuclear energy, goes greenPrime Minister Naoto Kan said his administration intends to dump plans to get half of the nation's future energy needs from nuclear power and instead place greater reliance on renewable energy sources.""I believe there's a need to start from a clean slate in discussing the basic energy plan,"" Kan said at a news conference May 10.The prime minister was referring to a plan approved last year to construct at least 14 additional nuclear reactors by 2030--a move that would ensure that about 70 percent of all power generation would be free of carbon dioxide emissions.While nuclear energy was expected to account for more than 50 percent of the power generated, the remaining 20 percent would come from renewable energy sources.Kan said further discussions would now be needed on the basic plan, indicating the possibility that approval would not be granted for the construction of new nuclear reactors.Kan said: ""While nuclear energy and fossil fuels have been the two main pillars of electric power, we will include renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and biomass, as a major energy component. We will also create an energy conservation society.""The prime minister added that further measures would be implemented to improve the safety of nuclear power.However, central government officials have yet to specify what forum would be used to discuss revision of the energy basic plan as well as any timetable for discussions.Kan also said he would for go his pay as prime minister from June until the situation at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant is resolved. He currently receives about 1.72 million yen ($21,000) a month, with 930,000 yen being the amount he is paid for serving as prime minister.Kan also abruptly turned his back on the nuclear power industry, saying, ""I would like to express my apologies because in addition to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the plant operator, the central government also bears a major responsibility for having promoted nuclear energy as a national policy.""He also indicated an independent committee would be established to look into nuclear accidents.He said three principles would be emphasized in the creation of the new committee: independence from traditional nuclear energy administration; openness to the public and international community; and comprehensiveness in its coverrage of the technology, structure and organization.The committee's main task would be uncovering the cause of nuclear accidents.When asked about compensation for the nuclear accident in Fukushima, Kan said: ""We are now proceeding with establishing a compensation plan. While primary responsibility lies with TEPCO, the central government will also assume responsibility to ensure appropriate compensation is provided.""Regarding measures announced by TEPCO to reduce expenditures, Kan said: ""We believe that is part of the efforts that will have to be made.

2107,chaanakya,12 May 2011 23:36 ,"Well previous post, but seems it needed to be reposted in full with link to busby's article intact. In the hope that it is read and understood before drawing conclusions. Of course some members would be myopic  while advising others to read.Well they said they had no time to read or understand. The argument questions LNT, ALARA and LSS studies while agreeing to ICRP model in respect of external radiation but questioning the leaving out  internal emitters ( due to inhalation of radionuclides such as cesium, plutonium etc. )Sorry for repeating but then needs to be read again.Here is a good explanation of radiation, units employed to measure it, its impact and the controversies surrounding it.http://www.llrc.org/agency/subtopic/kingscliffeaugeanbusby.pdfThough of posting few snippets but decided against it. 116 pages needs to be read in full to understand the jargons being posted here and limits being used with mathematical precision in relation to human health.Here is the abstract of the sweedish study  of 2006. It is paid copyrighted one so not posting in full. Only citasation abstract.Keywords:caesium-137;ionising radiataion;nuclear power;low dose;epidemiology;environment;background radiation;cancer;GIS;cohortAbstractBackgroundAfter the Chernobyl accident in 1986, as much as 5% of the released caesium-137 was deposited in Sweden due to a heavy rainfall 2 days after the event. A study of increased incidence of malignancies was initiated after the accident.MethodsThe cohort included 1,137,106 inhabitants who were 0–60 years old in 1986 and lived in 8 counties of Sweden with the highest fallout of caesium-137. With the dwelling coordinate, GIS-technique and a digital map on caesium-137, each individual was matched for the exposure. Adjustments were made for several potential confounding factors. During the follow-up 33,851 malignancies was recorded 1988–1999.ResultsExposure categories were: 0–8 (reference), 9–23, 24–43, 44–66, 67–84, and ≥85 nGy/hr. The corresponding adjusted Mantel-Haenszel incidence rate ratios for total malignancies during follow-up amounted to 1.000, 0.997, 1.072, 1.114, 1.068, 1.125, respectively. The excess relative risk per 100 nGy/hr with the same adjustments and time period was 0.042 95% confidence limit 0.001;0.084. An excess for thyroid cancer or leukemia could not be ruled out.ConclusionIncreased incidence of total malignancies possibly related to the fallout from the Chernobyl accident is seen.This is what is contested hotly by many.One point I would like to make here is that deaths related to nuclear accident ( attributed to it) are unlike train accident deaths. Some may die of accidents due to  blast at plant or may not. Few might die of exposure beyond limits, while many would die later of various reasons .Scientific studies exists to show that those deaths  are so  removed that causative link with radiation is difficult to establish based on certain radiation risk models. On the contrary seperate body of Scientific studies exist which tend to link them{this is why I am asking amit also to give causative link before claiming deaths due to coal  based on some study. you can't apply dual standards in your arguments. it would fall flat}I was surprised to find that regulatory authorities revised minimum safe radiation limits ( many concepts are explained in detail in the link) based on emerging evidences which could not be refuted by established conventional wisdom.  the exposure levels permitted by policymakers have continuously been readjusted throughout the last 80 years as every new discovery both in science and in epidemiology has shown that radiation exposure is more dangerous than previously thought. This process of discovery continues today although the dose limits are stuck at their 1990 levels. This is because the current official radiation risk models have not incorporated the most recent discoveries since to do so would force a complete reappraisal of the current use of nuclear power and the historic harm done by releases of radioactivity in the past Contemporary radiation risk models are so inaccurate for internal exposures that even some official risk agencies (IRSN) have pointed this out: yet they continue to be employed by governments and used by polluters to justify their past and present behaviour. There is now sufficient scientific proof of this in peer reviewed publish literature.  The weight of scientific belief about the dangers from internal radiation began to change in the mid 1990s with interest on the increasing evidence from nuclear site  clusters   and Chernobyl effects which clearly showed that the contemporary risk models were somehow false by a very large amount. Between about 1996 and 2000,  evidence began to emerge from the laboratory for genomic and bystander effects Since the then current ICRP model was based on genetic damage and a linear relation it was implicit by 2000 that this basis was completely incorrect. This, and various  other epidemiological evidence (which had now to be re-assessed) led to the  Committee Examining Radiation Risks from Internal Emitters and the ‘Radiation Science Wars’ of the early 2000s. The critical impact of the 2003 report of the European Committee on Radiation Risk, and the clear demonstrations in  epidemiological evidence from the Chernobyl; affected territories (infant leukem minisatellite mutations, cancer in Sweden, Belarus and Ukraine) that the ECRR predictions were close to what was seen was a turning point in a paradigm shift that continues today.  It is so clear to a rational audience that I have persuaded all of the courts or  juries that I have given presentations to. It is only the biased scientists of the nuclear  military  project and the economic and military vested interests that continue to support the conventional model. Part of the problem is that the area of radiation risk in not one area but many. Each expert or employee sees only part of the picture. The physicist sees the world as energy transfer and mathematics. The epidemiologist sees  the effects but doesn’t understand the physics and assumes absorbed dose is a real  parameter, a given. This was the problem with the late Sir Richard Doll, who I spoke  with about this. Doll based everything on absorbed dose and died believing that the Sellafield leukaemia cluster was not of radiological origin. The biochemist also  assumes absorbed dose is meaningful but here we are approaching reality if we are  prepared to think through the ionisations and their position on the target DNA. I  met very few experts in this field who see the whole picture; yet it is the whole picture that is necessary if one wishes to understand the issue. Each expert is an expert in one  filed, and can pass the buck: the epidemiologist says that the cancers are there but  they cant be due to radiation because the physicists say the dose is too low. The late  Martin Gardner, the Sellafield epidemiologist,  tried to get round the dose problem by assuming it was dose to the fathers sperm that was the trouble: he never questioned the paradigm, he never questioned is dose was a real thing. The physicists in their turn use dose: they invented it. They say that the Hiroshima studies show the cancers are  only there when the dose is high, but they don’t see the chemistry, they don’t know the stuff gets inside you and binds to the DNA they aren’t interested in such messy stuff, you cant use mathematics there.  No one asks the chemists because why would they? The chemists do chemistry? What do they know about dose?  But if dose isn’t appropriate or real (and it isn’t) the whole house of cards collapses The LSS were not begun until 1952. This was another flaw, since seven years of epidemiological data would be missing from the study and in addition, those selected into the study would have been healthy survivors: many of the victims of radiation would have died in the five years before the study began (Stewart and Kneale, 2000). It is clear from [b]reports of Japanese scientists that there were many deaths and leukemias occurring in the irradiated cities in the interim period and studies of the increases in cancers in the cities using external control data give higher cancer yields than the LSS yields which effectively employed internal controls[/b] (Kusano 1953, Busby 1995, Busby 2006, Sawada 2009). Long before then America's Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) urgently needed to regulate the growing nuclear industry. The AEC pressed the National Council for Radiation Protection (NCRP) to develop safety standards. An especial concern was the quantity of novel elements which, being alpha emitters, would present internal radiation hazards. Separate sub-committees addressed internal and external radiation. The external sub-committee completed its work quite quickly but the other was slowed down by the many complexities of internal contamination. The problem is that while physicists can tell you the ergs from any radioactive decay, they don't have much clue about where internal radioactivity goes inside the body, how long it stays there or what biological damage it's doing. Impatient with the delays, NCRP's Executive closed down the internal committee in 1951, and stretched the report of the external committee to cover internal radiation.  The problem in the court of scientific opinion (and indeed in a court of law) with cancer causation is that there is generally a time lag between cause and effect, and since there are many mutagenic causes, it is difficult to make a connection which is unassailable in logic. In the case of the Sellafield childrens’ leukemia (and other similar clusters) despite the fact that they lived near the most radioactively polluted site in Europe, and that radiation is the only known cause of childhood leukemia, it was argued that the ICRP Hiroshima model did not predict the risk and so it must have been something else.Adding further5.4 Effects on future generations ....to give advice on the disposal of radioactive waste...focused on the long term. The consideration was of the 100,000 year time scale. The members of CoRWM very rightly wanted to ensure that future generation would not be affected by what we do now. I did some calculations and reported that the main problem was the Uranium and Thorium series nuclides and plutonium. These are very harmful as they bind to DNA and in the case of U-238 carry the extra photoelectronhazard, so the U-238 doses have to be multiplied by 1000 to get the biologically effective dose at the DNA. The pit will still be there in the year 100,000. So will a very large amount of the radioactivity. If they remain in the bags and don’t pass ithe water table to be ingested, the uranium and thorium series nuclides will be there in secular equilibrium with the parent nuclides in the year 100,000, or even in the year 1,000,000. If they do pass into the water, they will poison those who drink it. The plutonium also will be there and so will several other transuranics. The result of the collection of this stuff into the pit is that it will inevitably contaminate humans and also will deliver external doses to humans and animals and plants. It is plain silly to suggest otherwise through mathematical sleight of hand, smoke and mirrors. The result will be given by a collective dose calculation taken forward through thousands of generations and leading to genetic diseases and cancer in our descendants."

There is a saying, but it is self-evident..If you repeat 2+2 = 959599595 , even a million times, it is still false.And if you start  (or put them in middle)  with such an erroneous  step ,  final results need not be credible. I am amazed, that some one will take this seriously (specially considering the scientific background of most of the people here who can easily judge the validity by looking at the contents..)Okay. Sorry for all the editorial comments, Let me just point out one or two items, which I noticed.Take 4.1 line 1It gives the definition of Roentgen as: Exposure: The quantity of radiation which causes a defined number of ions in dry airFirst, it is not  an unit of Radiation in general  (as other units given in the table, like Rad, Gray etc), just ionizing-radiation  (Eg x-rays, or gamma-rays ...NOT, for example, from neutrons.)I can see, people defending this sloppiness, but any introductory text book  (even my message here in brf (see here)  or even wiki is not that sloppy.(For those who want to get technical details, ""R"" which measures charge (and not energy) is not really a good measure  for radiation absorbed - In fact, ""R"" has become obsolete among the current generation of scientists)But next part, takes the cake, it says ""# of ionizing pairs""   .. Arre baba, R  is defined as radiation required to  liberate  ""electric charge""/(unit volume) . and not # or  ion-pairs.  Even wiki gets it right. (I just checked) (BTW the electric charge  in the above definition is 1 esu which  approximately  may give about 2.1 x 10^9 pairs in ordinary air) (Which is why no one measures other than gamma/X-ray rays radiation in R)(Sure, normally there are certain number of ion pairs per unit charge.. but if I have to specify price of   U, I will say Rs x/Kg ... not Rs x/(per cake) )  Of course, as pointed out before,Table 4.2 still shows, value in mSV (1000 -  Based on erythemal (skin reddening)  X-ray dos   ).. Sv unit wasn't even there (it was introduce much later - decades later) Paper does not give, any link, or even say how Roentgen's was converted in Sv  or even the basis where one gets that number.And BTW, Roentgen  unit was not there either in 1927!     (It got adopted in 1928)Neither, it gives a link, or basis, where it gets, (For ""Statutory annual radiation dose limits to members of the public over the  radiation"")  1 mSv with ""  huge  evidence of harm from internal exposures at lower  doses    )  { Where this ""huge"" evidence comes, or what exactly is this limit, author does not say  )Folks, Just wanted you to know.  You can make up your own mind about credibility of this report, which gets.. even the basics wrong."

2110,Amber G.,13 May 2011 06:20 ,"Retyping..  Wrt to comment on the paper by Busby, PhD (http://www.llrc.org/agency/subtopic/kingscliffeaugeanbusby.pdf Folks, here are just two examples from around pp 16. Disclaimer: I have seen the intro of Dr  Busby in his paper, this,  by no means to diss him, or Institutions which he is associated with. This  is just to show gross errors and sloppiness in the previous mentioned paper.I encourage people to read the following (along with any standard sources) post, along with the paper to get the context.  I know Chaanakya respects this author, that is fine. The views are mine and mine alone. If more insults like “banana experts""  come my way,  so be it, but I do hope that if people like to comment or ask questions, these questions  should be technical  and based on contents of my post rather than personal attacks.I do believe, that this will also give some insight to most of the readers to gain more understanding on some of the technical    issues involved and background, so if interested  read more, and take it FWIW.Example 1:Here are more details on  Rontgen unit from the paper: (I was wondering how he got it so wrong in Table 4.1)   The energy transfer unit developed by the physicists was the Roentgen (R) adopted by the International Congress on Radiology in 1928. The unit was defined as the amount of radiation needed to produce a given number of ions in dry air in an ionization chamber, …First, it is NOT energy, but rather charge/unit volume .. BIG difference.. that’s why one measures only gamma (or xrays) exposure in Roentgen and not, say neutron radiation.  For Beta rays, electron charge is fixed  but energy vary! This is why,  later,  Rad and Gray (which measures, energy absorbed) were used. With Biological effect , Rem (and Sv) were introduced. Also the definition of R was 1 esu/unit_volume (Not # of Ion pairs)Another sloppiness , Author ignores the difference between ""exposure"" and ""energy absorbed"" and equates (  .. without even bothering to explain anything!) ..1 R = 1 Rad !!. Cause of    1 R is  ROUGHLY equal to (for calculation purposes)   energy absorbed of  1 Rad,   only for gamma rays, in dry air.   Even there, depending on the text book one uses, the factor is something like 0.877 and not 1. .. (And I am not even mentioning that, while for R, one goes by per unit volume - while for Rad it is energy/Kg   --- remember, some human beings are not made of air -- different materials with same volume may have different mass  ityadi ityadi..  )Example 2:  (Has been quoted by Chaanakyaji before, so may look familier)For example, one cup of boiling water at 100 degrees centigrade contains the same energy, the same number of Joules, as a bucket of water at the temperature of twenty degrees. An energy transfer to a person of one waterthrow unit could encompass either a cupful of boiling water in..Never mind, use of “cup” and “bucket”  (why not x liter).. but it shows complete ignorance of concept of energy in water. No, it is not out of context, it only gets worse….Example was not even necessary.  I looked at a few pages more, in  virtually every page one finds gross errors. Can some one confirm, if this was published in a peer reviewed journal? Which one?"

Vavilov Institute of General Genetics Russian Academy of Sciences, Gybkin st. 3, Moscow 119991, RussiaMutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis; Mutation Research 671 (2009) 52–57The monitoring carried out after the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) showed increased frequencies of chromosome aberrations in somatic cells of permanent residents of territories with radionuclide contaminations, “liquidators” of the accident and their children [1–9]. This is accompanied by increased morbidity, frequent cases of congenital malformations in newborns and oncopathologies [10,11].Investigations carried out in the last decades have led to the discovery of the phenomenon of radiation-induced genomic insta- bility, first experimentally and later confirmed in people living on radionuclide-contaminated territories [12–23]. Genomic instabil- ity is destabilization of the genome, both spontaneous and induced by external factors. It can manifest itself as chromosome aber- rations and gene mutations. Genomic instability occurs in the progeny of mitotically dividing cells and results in the disturbances of the functions of cells, tissues, organs and systems of the human organism. The basis of this phenomenon can be potential DNA changes realized/expressed in subsequent cell divisions [24].Radiation-induced genomic instability can be transmitted trans- generationally from one or both irradiated parents and is expressed in somatic cells of their children [25–31]. The phenomenon of trans- generational genomic instability was also revealed experimentally in the different animal model [32–36]. It is known that the mutagenic effect of low doses of ionizing radiation differs from the effects of medium and high doses [37–40]. Exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation is more frequent than exposure to high and medium doses, and its consequences are less studied. Hence it is particularly important to study the genomic instability and its transgenerational effects in children of irradiated parents after low-dose radiation exposure.Earlier, we have demonstrated the phenomenon of transgenerational radiation-induced genomic instability in children born to irradiated fathers (“liquidators”) and non-irradiated mothers [30]. In addition studies were done in children born and living on terri- tories contaminated with radionuclides whose parents were both irradiated as a result of the Chernobyl accident in different periods of their ontogenetic development [30].To further elucidate the phenomenon of transgenerational genomic instability in somatic cells of those children, experiments were undertaken to model induced genomic instability by using the in vitro low-dose [gamma]-irradiation of peripheral blood samples from both children and their parents.[...]It is known that the action of low-dose ionizing radiation is characterized by the absence of a dose threshold, by biological amplification of induced genomic changes, by a non- linear dose–effect relationship, and by an increased sensitivity to endo/exogenous factors [37–40]. Therefore, the results of experimental investigation of genomic instability and its trans-generational phenomenon after exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation are somewhat different as compared to the results for medium- and high-dose exposure.In children born to irradiated fathers and in children living on territories contaminated with radionuclides whose parents were both irradiated the AGFs were similar, but significantly higher than in the control (Table 1). Therefore, radiation-induced genomic instability was observed not only in the organism of children from radiocontaminated territories but also in the organism of non-irradiated children born to irradiated parents. The following consideration should be taken into account in order to understand the causes of this phenomenon.In the children from contaminated areas the intrauterine and postnatal development proceeded under conditions of chronic low- dose ionizing radiation. They were exposed to radiation even at the prezygote stage of development as their fathers and moth- ers were irradiated in the pubertal period during the accident at the ChNPP and before conception of the children they lived on the contaminated territories under conditions of chronic exposure to long-lived	isotopes 137 Cs, 90 Sr and others. In this period of onto-genetic development the formation of the reproductive systems occurs in the organism. The children of irradiated fathers (liquidators) were exposed at the stage of paternal gametes. Although the fact of transgenerational genomic instability in the offspring of irradiated fathers has been documented, the mechanism of this phenomenon is poorly understood.The phenomenon of transgenerational genomic instability is confirmed by a statistically significant increase in the somatic cells AGF observed after fractional and single irradiation of lymphocytes at low doses in the children of irradiated parents as compared to the children of non-irradiated parents (control). An increased radiosensitivity of aberrant cells is observed after 60 Co [gamma]-irradiation of lymphocytes in vitro at a medium dose of 1.5Gy in children of patients subjected to roentgenochemotherapy, in children of liquidators and in children evacuated from radioactively contam- inated regions as compared to children of non-irradiated parents [28].[...]Modeling of genomic instability after irradiation in vitro at low doses showed:(1) that children of irradiated parents had significantly higher AGF than children of non-irradiated parents, which confirms the transgenarational genomic instability in their organism;(2) that single-break aberrations of the chromosomal type pre- dominated in mitosis 2 as compared to mitosis 1 (elimination of double-break aberrations), pointing to the reality of genomic instability in succeeding cell generations;(3) that prolonged exposure of the human organism to low-dose radiation affects radiosensitivity of cell genomes.Taken together, this may be a prerequisite for increased morbidity in children and for transgenerational transmission of genomic instability to succeeding generations. Further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism of transgenera- tional genomic instability."

Chaanakya - can you tell from that, in which peer reviewed paper, the paper you are vouching for its credibility is published? Thanks in advance..From:http://www.chrisbusbyexposed.org/index.html.  This website has been created in order to counteract the web attacks on Chris Busby's credibility which have been increasing recently in proportion to his success in creating serious questions about the health effects of ionizing radiation and about the health effects of exposure to Uranium Weapons.  The attacks are from many named individuals  (example Roger Helbig) and from those who write under an anonymous pseudonym (example Richard D) and when stopped under one pseudonym, just change their identity and continue. This website will take each of these people and each of the attacks, and respond. For a long time, we ignored these attacks, but this was an error. It has now become necessary to deal with these people because the attackers have now stepped up their level of energy. Phone conversions and private research reports are being accessed, and attacked as soon as they are written. This is now affecting funding applications for research grants, the ability to publish in peer-review journals, and legal court cases. Chris Busby's CV is available on this siteOver the next few weeks, Chris Busby will address these issues and his attackers one by one. Chaankaya, if you Dr Busby's email address, you may invite him to BRF.  In any case I do not see him addressing any issues, at least not yet."

Low doses of radiation may be a concern and needs to be researched further. You are right in saying your disclaimer and I do subscribe to that as well. The problem is even peer reviewed paper is trashed without reading as one swedish study posted by me earlier. And when posted they ask whether it is peer reviewed and in which journal.Your quoted paper , with the disclaimer, makes at least one point. That low doses of radiation due to irradiated parents ( remember irradiated breast milk) lead to some consequences not wholly desirable.I am , also , not sure about plutonium binding, but substanced have tendencies to accumulate in certain areas of the bodies, such as Sr which gets into bones and Cs in Muscles, (subject to any corrections)"

Sorry for all the editorial comments, Let me just point out one or two items, which I noticed.Take 4.1 line 1It gives the definition of Roentgen as: Exposure: The quantity of radiation which causes a defined number of ions in dry airFirst, it is not  an unit of Radiation in general  (as other units given in the table, like Rad, Gray etc), just ionizing-radiation  (Eg x-rays, or gamma-rays ...NOT, for example, from neutrons.)I can see, people defending this sloppiness, but any introductory text book  (even my message here in brf (see here)  or even wiki is not that sloppy.(For those who want to get technical details, ""R"" which measures charge (and not energy) is not really a good measure  for radiation absorbed - In fact, ""R"" has become obsolete among the current generation of scientists)But next part, takes the cake, it says ""# of ionizing pairs""   .. Arre baba, R  is defined as radiation required to  liberate  ""electric charge""/(unit volume) . and not # or  ion-pairs.  Even wiki gets it right.

2146,chaanakya,13 May 2011 11:32 ,"^^ theo , no issues there. ThanksGov't finally decides to help TEPCO with compensation burdenFriday 13th May, 09:20 AM JST TOKYO —The government agreed Friday on a scheme to help Tokyo Electric Power Co bear its massive compensation burden resulting from the ongoing nuclear crisis at its Fukushima plant, by approving the creation of a new body to facilitate payments and monitor the company’s streamlining efforts.The decision, delayed for a day due to disagreement inside the ruling party, is expected to ensure swift payment of the estimated trillions of yen in damages over the country’s worst nuclear accident, in which the release of huge amounts of radioactive substances has affected local residents and industries.The government is expected to introduce necessary bills to the Diet during the ongoing parliamentary session to create the envisioned institution, which would play a role in injecting public money into TEPCO to save it from being crushed by debt.The latest development came as TEPCO decided to accept all the conditions the government presented to the company after it asked for state support due to fears of a capital shortage.Under the conditions, TEPCO will not set an upper limit on compensation payments in advance, will make maximum cost-cutting efforts and will accept an investigation into its management by a third-party panel set up by the government in a bid to ensure thorough cost-cutting and strict asset evaluation.As for the envisioned institution, the government will issue and allocate to it a type of bond that gains no interest and can be cashed when necessary so it can secure funding to support TEPCO, according to a draft government plan.The new body would seek contributions from electricity firms that own nuclear power plants other than TEPCO and is also expected to function as an insurance entity to prepare for possible future nuclear accidents.But concerns linger that the scheme may lead utilities to pass on the costs to consumers through electricity bills.The nuclear disaster triggered in the wake of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northeastern Japan has forced many residents around the Fukushima Daiichi plant to evacuate from their homes, and damaged the agriculture, livestock and fishery industries in the region.With TEPCO still struggling to bring troubled reactors under control, the total cost of compensation and expenses for decommissioning the six-reactor complex is not yet clear.Some precedence for Nuclear Liability bill for India.And  some factoring of cost for NPPs"

Approval will enable Tokyo Electric Power Co. to announce its consolidated financial results for fiscal 2010 on May 20.TEPCO is expected to post a net loss of 700 billion yen to 800 billion yen for fiscal 2010.The company's results will also include an extraordinary loss of about 1 trillion yen for waste disposal related to the ongoing nuclear crisis.The utility is expected to pay about 200 billion yen in compensation annually, plus about 1 trillion yen per year to operate thermal power plants after suspending operations at nuclear power plants.It will also need about 1.5 trillion yen to decommission the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant and about 250 billion yen to restore equipment in disaster-stricken plants to normal operations.To fund these heavy financial obligations, the utility is expected to jack up electricity rates 16 percent, while Japan's eight other power companies will chip in an amount equivalent to a 2-percent hike in their respective service areas."

2166,chaanakya,13 May 2011 15:31 ,"Melted nuclear fuel shows TEPCO's data lacks credibilityMelted nuclear fuel inside the No. 1 reactor of the crippled Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant has been found at the bottom of the reactor's pressure vessel, indicating there is a likelihood of a hole up to several centimeters in it, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) announced.Many fuel rods at the reactor are under water and in a stable condition. But TEPCO's failure to detect a massive leak of water and to accurately measure water levels is likely to force the utility to review a road map that calls for bringing the plant's damaged reactors to a stable condition, known as a ""cold shutdown,"" in about six to nine months.TEPCO concluded that a large portion of fuel had melted inside the pressure vessel after workers double-checked the amount of water and found the water level inside the No. 1 reactor to be very low. TEPCO measures the water level by checking the differential between about 5 meters above the top of the 4-meter-long fuel rods and about 1.5 meters from the bottom of the fuel rods.TEPCO had initially announced that the water level was about 1.6 to 1.7 meters from the top of the fuel rods. But new data revealed that the water level was at a point more than 5 meters below the top of the fuel rods.The temperature at the lower section of the pressure vessel stood at a reasonable 100 to 120 degrees, leading the utility to speculate that a large portion of the fuel rods had previously melted, sank to the bottom of the vessel and were cooled.Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA), said the latest data has more credibility than previous data.But Tadashi Narabayashi, a professor of reactor engineering at Hokkaido University, said, ""It is problematic that TEPCO kept releasing data as if the water gauges were functioning properly. I wonder what a road map based on such data really means.""He said that most fuel was probably at the bottom of the pressure vessel and is being cooled. He cited a possibility that equipment which drives the control rods and other devices is penetrating and probably damaging the bottom of the vessel.TEPCO officials said at a news conference on the night of May 12 that the pressure vessel's bottom appeared to have a hole measuring a total of several centimeters from which water and the fuel were likely leaking.The question remains when the fuel melted and sank to the bottom. Nuclear fuel starts melting at an extremely high 2,800 degrees Celsius.Hisashi Ninokata, a professor of nuclear engineering at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, speculated that the nuclear fuel probably melted when the fuel rods emerged from water immediately after an explosion of high calorific value. He said the current volume of calorific value is low and the fuel above water can be cooled with steam.In the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in which a core meltdown occurred in its Unit 2 reactor, it took the plant operator and U.S. authorities 14 years to clean up radiation due to the difficulty in removing the melted fuel rods.Ninokata said, ""This time, workers cooled the reactors with sea water and there is a fear that salt has accelerated the pressure vessel's corrosion and damaged the unit. There is also a possibility of the melted fuel and metal from the cover pipes being mixed and solidified, making efforts to remove them (to shut down the reactor) a challenging task.""NISA defines a fall of melted fuel rods to the bottom of a pressure vessel as a meltdown. TEPCO acknowledged that it is a meltdown if the fuel rods are not in their original form.Haruki Madarame, chairman of the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan, said at a news conference on May 12, ""It was not surprising because we predicted a melting of the fuel rods at an early stage. We don't think all of the fuel rods are under water judging from temperatures inside the pressure vessel. We want to do more analysis."""
2167,brihaspati,13 May 2011 17:53 ,"Chaanakya ji,my standard disclaimer was meant to address the three main approaches I have found on ""nuke"" threads about material published in peer-reviewed papers from journals - if the content or focus or conclusion of such papers go against whatever be the collection of agenda of certain ""posting"" positions. The disclaimer need not reflect my own assessments about peer-reviewed papers from journals published more or less well-established publishing houses like Elsevier, Kluwer, Wiley, etc. I am regularly involved in reviewing for several journals from the first two, and I know that it is not so easy to pass off dubious material. Moreover the procedure to contradict published material that you think is dubious - is pretty well-established. I am sure those who ""trash"" such papers, or find the authors ""perfidious"", are also aware of the regular channels and procedures to get their grievances addressed. Either they know that they themselves have not really thought it through, or are not confident enough about their own counter claims, or it is perhaps a simple case of the much lighter effort needed to paint the authors black for their supposed ""ideological proclivities/perfidies/"" rather than going through the pain of writing up a counter-paper and see it through the review process.If it was ""history/political science/philosophy"" type of subject I would have conceded about personal ideological proclivities possibly affecting the group paradigm about topics - and hence opposed to say alternative opinions hwich they would suppress from getting aired if they have had a stranglehold on ""publishing"" filters. But in ""exact"" or rather ""numerate"" sciences, such manipulation would be very very difficult.The transgenerational passing on of genomic instabilities is a relatively new find, and seems so far to be specifically more associated with persistent low level irradiation at a level higher than ""background"" which started off from accidental or unforeseen release of nuclear material into the environment due to human activity. Obviously it is not attributable to things like tsunami/earthquake. I will report also similar peer-reviewed papers about similar finds that see possible correlation with burning coal - as and when I find them. The environs of Fukushima should be subjected to similar investigations and follow up on this potential mutational hazard that appear to be transmitted through gametes and therefore whose effects may persist over many generations."

So ultimately the proposal really is supporting all of the compensation by public money.Tana ji saar,no issues with the security requirements.

Sorry for all the editorial comments, Let me just point out one or two items, which I noticed.Take 4.1 line 1It gives the definition of Roentgen as: >>>Exposure: The quantity of radiation which causes a defined number of ions in dry air<<<First, it is not  an unit of Radiation in general  (as other units given in the table, like Rad, Gray etc), just ionizing-radiation  (Eg x-rays, or gamma-rays ...NOT, for example, from neutrons.)I can see, people defending this sloppiness, but any introductory text book  (even my message here in brf (see here)  or even wiki is not that sloppy.(For those who want to get technical details, ""R"" which measures charge (and not energy) is not really a good measure  for radiation absorbed - In fact, ""R"" has become obsolete among the current generation of scientists)But next part, takes the cake, it says ""# of ionizing pairs""   .. Arre baba, R  is defined as radiation required to  liberate  ""electric charge""/(unit volume) . and not # or  ion-pairs.  Even wiki gets it right. (I just checked) (BTW the electric charge  in the above definition is 1 esu which  approximately  may give about 2.1 x 10^9 pairs in ordinary air) (Which is why no one measures other than gamma/X-ray rays radiation in R)(Sure, normally there are certain number of ion pairs per unit charge.. but if I have to specify price of   U, I will say Rs x/Kg ... not Rs x/(per cake) )  Of course, as pointed out before,Table 4.2 still shows, value in mSV (1000 -  Based on erythemal (skin reddening)  X-ray dos   ).. Sv unit wasn't even there (it was introduce much later - decades later) Paper does not give, any link, or even say how Roentgen's was converted in Sv  or even the basis where one gets that number.And BTW, Roentgen  unit was not there either in 1927!     (It got adopted in 1928)Neither, it gives a link, or basis, where it gets, (For ""Statutory annual radiation dose limits to members of the public over the  radiation"")  1 mSv with ""  huge  evidence of harm from internal exposures at lower  doses    )  { Where this ""huge"" evidence comes, or what exactly is this limit, author does not say  )Folks, Just wanted you to know.

2185,chaanakya,13 May 2011 20:02 ,"Sewage plants in Fukushima perplexed over how to dispose of highly radioactive sludgeHighly radioactive sludge found at sewage plants in Fukushima Prefecture will be temporarily kept at those plants, the central government has announced.The move came after high levels of radioactive cesium were detected in sludge and other waste material at sewage plants in Fukushima Prefecture -- home to the disaster-crippled Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant.On May 12, the government announced that highly radioactive sludge will be tentatively kept at sewage plants in the prefecture, while sludge with relatively low-level radiation could be recycled into cement and other material.While highly-radioactive sludge will be treated in the same way as radioactive waste for the time being, no plans for the final disposal of such sludge were presented. It will also be difficult to promote the recycling of sludge with high-level radiation contamination. Since relevant laws and regulations do not cover highly-radioactive sludge at sewage plants, the government faces serious challenges in handling the issue.According to the announcement, sludge with radioactivity levels of over 100,000 becquerels per kilogram should preferably be incinerated and melted in Fukushima Prefecture before being kept at sewage plants. Ash generated through sludge incineration should be contained in metal barrels to prevent it from scattering. Sludge with radioactivity levels of under 100,000 becquerels per kilogram can be temporarily kept at sewage plants and controlled disposal sites, with radioactivity monitoring required.""Radioactive sludge should be treated in the same way as radioactive waste,"" said an official with the Cabinet Office's Nuclear Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters, adding, ""We will look into how to ultimately dispose of it later.""Sludge with radioactivity levels of under 1,000 becquerels per kilogram can be recycled into cement and other material if the levels can be reduced to under 100 becquerels through mixture with other materials and dilution.""The volume of radioactive sludge should be reduced as much as possible through recycling,"" said an official with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, adding that the recycling of such sludge into fertilizer should be withheld for the time being.The government also announced that safety standards for workers at sewage plants should be applied in accordance with the Ordinance on the Prevention of Ionizing Radiation Hazards, which is administered by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.The ordinance mandates operators to set up controlled areas and control radiation doses if radiation levels in the air at workplaces are expected to exceed 1.3 millisieverts in three months. However, since the ordinance does not presume cases in which private operators transport radioactive sludge, the government cannot obligate forwarding agents to take the abovementioned measures.On May 1, the Fukushima Prefectural Government announced that 334,000 becquerels per kilogram of radioactive cesium was detected in molten slag after sludge was processed with high heat at a purification center in Koriyama, Fukushima Prefecture. The finding was followed by the detection of radioactive cesium in sludge at 15 other sewage plants in the prefecture, as well as at one sewage treatment facility in Tochigi Prefecture, one in Ibaraki Prefecture, three in Gunma Prefecture and one in Niigata Prefecture. The Kanagawa Prefectural Government announced on May 12 that cesium was detected in sludge at four sewage plants in the prefecture, while the Tokyo Metropolitan Government disclosed the same day that up to 24,000 becquerels of radioactivity was detected in sludge incineration ash at three sewage plants in the capital."

One of their first tasks was to recalibrate some of the sensors on the reactor, so that engineers had a better sense of how it was doing. That recalibration has led to a startling revelation: virtually all of the fuel inside the unit 1 reactor appears to have ""melted down"".Press reports on the meltdown have variously described it as a setback and or admission by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) that things are worse than they thought. There's more about what it all means below the fold (for a broader overview, check out our video on Fukushima).Meltdowns definedDuring normal operation, the core of a nuclear power reactor like unit 1 consists of long narrow tubes of a zirconium alloy filled with uranium fuel pellets. Tubes are bundled together into ""assemblies"" which in turn make up the core of the reactor. When it's humming along at full tilt, the core boils water that is used to turn turbines in the adjacent building. After the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, the water stopped circulating and the core heated up.At some point, it got hot enough that the zirconium tubes began to split and warp, the beginning of the ""meltdown"" at unit 1. Nobody can know for sure what happened inside the core, but it appears that the uranium pellets fell out of their assemblies and began gathering at the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel (see diagram).Reactor restart?This much was already known, and TEPCO had suggested that only about 70% of the core had melted down. But after recalibrating its instruments for measuring water levels inside the reactor, the company now believes that the core has entirely melted down.Some have theorized that with all the fuel at the bottom of the vessel, unit 1 may have actually restarted its nuclear reactions. If that had happened, the fuel would be pumping out some portion of its normal 1380 megawatts of thermal power—probably enough to melt through the thick steal reactor pressure vessel. It would have dropped onto a concrete slab below (the basemat), where it would have hopefully been spread out, effectively diffusing the chain reaction.There's some reason to think that this ""China syndrome"", as it is informally known, didn't happen. Nuclear engineers I've spoken to say that reactors like unit 1 are finicky beasts. Their fuel needs to be carefully configured to work, and they won't restart if the stuff is just a gloop on the bottom of the vessel. In addition, workers injected boric acid into the reactor just before the restart. Boron is a neutron absorber and would spoil any nuclear reactions. Moreover, temperature sensors at the bottom of the reactor vessel are continuing to function, suggesting it wasn't completely destroyed.That doesn't mean that portions of the fuel weren't briefly producing power during the accident. Nor does it mean that the reactor's fuel has remained wholly inside the pressure vessel. In fact, a note from the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (JAIF) quotes Banri Kaieda, the nation's Economy, Trade and Industry Minister, as saying that it is ""a fact"" that there were holes created by the meltdown. That would likely mean at least some of the uranium fuel is now lying on the basemat below, or perhaps even outside the concrete containment.Clean up and beyondWhatever happened inside unit 1, it happened weeks ago. The temperature inside the core is currently around 100C, according to the latest data from the nation's nuclear regulator—far less than it would be if nuclear reactions were continuing inside the core. But there are still some serious implications for cleanup.The most immediate problem is for a planned recirculation system to cool the core. The plan was to feed water through two emergency systems, the core spray system and the primary containment's cooling spray system. Both are normally designed to funnel water into the core in the case of an emergency. Water exits the core through the AC piping system, normally used to inject nitrogen gas, according to Margaret Harding, an independent nuclear consultant who has been going over the plans in detail. From there, the water would flow to an improvised heat exchanger that would cool it before returning it to the core.The recirculation system would have two big advantages. First, it would create less radioactive wastewater than is currently generated by just dumping water onto the reactor. Second, it would be more efficient, allowing the reactor to reach cold shutdown—a state where it is more-or-less safe in a matter of months.Unfortunately, despite TEPCO continuously pumping fresh water into the containment vessel, water levels are too low for the system to work - presumably because the water's surface is below the AC outlet. Nobody really know where all the water is going - but it can't be anywhere good. If workers can't find a way to patch up unit 1, then they'll probably have give up on the plan. In the longer term, the meltdown makes removing the fuel much more complicated. Normally, the fuel can only be accessed using a massive overhead crane. The crane has already likely been damaged by an earlier explosion, and now, if the fuel is damaged too, it's unclear whether a replacement crane can easily remove it.Despite all these setbacks, clean up plans continue. Today, TEPCO announced that it had started initial construction of a cover for the unit 1 reactor. The temporary cover will prevent the spread of radiation, and protect the damaged reactor. Proper construction will begin on 6 June.By the way, does this mean our article titled ""The meltdown that wasn't"" was mistitled? Pretty much, yes. But the point of the article stands: it could have been a lot worse.Nuclear reactors under stress - May 13, 2011http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/05/nuclear_reactors_under_stress.htmlThe European Commission and the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG) yesterday failed to reach agreement on the criteria for safety tests – or 'stress tests' – of Europe's nuclear power reactors. The tests, ordered by the European Union in March following the Fukushima disaster, are designed to check that plants can withstand natural disasters and other unexpected events. Yesterday's talks became deadlocked because of resistance by France and the UK to including the risk of terrorist and cyber attacks in the tests. The groups will meet again in Prague 19-20 May to try to reach agreement.The European Commission has a FAQ on the stress tests here. It promises to get tough:""What happens, if a country does not shut down a plant which fails the tests?The Commission will publish the report of the national authority and also the peer review. This means that the results are known to the public and a government has explain to its public why it has taken a decision or failed to act. ""Meanwhile, the New York Times reports than an initial check-up on US nuclear reactors, by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has found serious problems with emergency management equipment:Marty Virgilio, the deputy executive director of the agency, told the five commissioners that inspectors checked a sample of equipment at all 104 reactors and found problems at less than a third of them. The problems included pumps that would not start or, if they did, did not put out the required amount of water; equipment that was supposed to be set aside for emergencies but was being used in other parts of the plants; emergency equipment that would be needed in case of flood stored in places that could be flooded; and insufficient diesel on hand to run backup systems."

Levels at the other pumps were 10 to 49 millisieverts per hour.TEPCO therefore determined it was safe for workers to enter the building and has already finished removing radioactive substances from the building's air."

2196,chaanakya,14 May 2011 10:37 ,"Fukushima kids 'get 10 mSv of radiation a yr'The Yomiuri ShimbunThe education ministry has estimated children who attend schools in Fukushima Prefecture where radiation exceeds government limits but restrict their outdoor activities will be exposed to about 10 millisieverts of radiation a year, less than the annual limit set by the government due to the nuclear crisis.In the prefecture most affected by the crisis at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, radiation levels temporarily exceeded the limit of 3.8 microsieverts per hour at 13 schools and kindergartens. But the ministry did not say how many of these schools would see radiation levels above 10 millisieverts in the estimates released Thursday.On April 19, the government announced steps to prevent radiation exposure from harming children's health. Under the steps, a limit on annual radiation exposure for children was set at 20 millisieverts and the government said outdoor activity should be less than one hour per day if radiation at a school is higher than 3.8 microsieverts per hour.The government has made areas where annual radiation levels are expected to exceed 20 millisieverts subject to its planned evacuation instruction, which asks residents to leave around late May.The Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry said the annual radiation limit set in April is reasonable and the estimates were only half that amount. But the ministry acknowledged it needed to make further efforts to reduce radiation levels not only on school grounds but also outside school.According to the ministry's estimates, children who attend schools where radiation levels exceed the hourly limit would receive 9.99 millisieverts of radiation yearly in their daily lives, with 17 percent of the exposure occurring at school.Senior Vice Minister Kan Suzuki said at a press conference Thursday: ""The radiation levels students receive at school have been found to be very low. This could be because of restricted outdoor activities, but it's hard to imagine they're not going outside at all.""Suzuki said the ministry intends to set up an expert panel in regards to the issue. ""To address physical and emotional health concerns about children, we'd like to hear opinions from experts,"" he said.However, some lawmakers and members of the public have demanded the government revise the 20-millisievert safety limit.Masamichi Nishio, director of the Hokkaido Cancer Center, sounded a warning over the ministry estimates.""During nonemergency times, the annual amount of radiation permitted for ordinary people should be 1 millisievert except for natural radiation,"" Nishio said. ""Taking risks of cancer and other health hazards into consideration, even 10 millisieverts [per year] isn't absolutely safe for children, since they're particularly vulnerable to radiation exposure. It's not good to have schools in locations where accumulated doses reach such levels.""Gen Suzuki, a professor at the International University of Health and Welfare, however, had a different view. ""I don't think 10 millisieverts of radiation a year would pose an immediate health risk to children. But efforts to reduce radiation levels in the whole region are needed,"" he said.""For example, the surface soil of yards, parks and other areas should be replaced with underlying soil. Cleaning asphalt roads, walls and roofs with pressure washers is also effective. It's important to take care of the environment while letting people go on with their daily lives,"" Suzuki said."

Ashes and sludge are quite different materials. What exactly was mixed with the concrete and quickly used, I wonder?A few years ago I remember how in one prefecture bricks were deliberately manufactured mixed with uranium waste as a way of disposal. Causing geiger counters to click idly, they were sold throughout the country.Perhaps this kind of thinking was applied here. Or perhaps it is just coincidence.Or perhaps a serious crime has been committed here.Seems like nobody was on this one, it's all haphazard, after-the-fact realization and back-checking. It seems obvious now, but there may be a dozen more ""Um oops"" things like this that nobody thought of yet which will come up as time goes by. Next question: where are they going to dispose of the radioactive sludge? This is nuclear waste."

The Nos. 1 and 2 reactors have already been shut down for decommissioning, while its No. 3 reactor was suspended for regular checkups.The operator said it hopes to resume the plant soon after taking measures to block quake-triggered tsunami waves but Gov. Heita Kawakatsu remains cautious about the idea."
2201,chaanakya,14 May 2011 11:12 ,"Govt OK's nuclear crisis redress plan / 9 utilities may aid TEPCO's compensationThe Yomiuri ShimbunThe government on Friday officially approved a framework for compensating people affected by the ongoing nuclear crisis at Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, in a scheme that would require nine other utilities to make contributions that could be used for compensation.The framework would place TEPCO under effective state control.Under the framework, TEPCO would pay compensation to people affected by the disaster at the Fukushima plant under the support of a new body to be established by the government--tentatively called the ""nuclear power plant compensation institution."" TEPCO would repay the envisaged institution out of its yearly profits.While the framework does not set an upper limit on compensation payments to be made by the utility, it stipulates the institution would keep the firm solvent until it finishes making payments  .The decision to adopt the compensation framework was made at a meeting of concerned Cabinet ministers.The framework also states that power companies that operate nuclear plants would be obliged to contribute to the new institution. Eight other power companies--excluding Okinawa Electric Power Co., which does not have a nuclear plant--and Japan Atomic Power Co. would also be required to contribute.Taking into account public backlash over an expected rise in electricity bills, the basic position for assisting TEPCO was changed from ""minimizing financial burdens"" in an earlier draft to ""minimizing the people's burden.""  In addition, the government would monitor TEPCO's streamlining efforts, such as selling assets and cutting payroll. The government also would allocate no-interest bonds to the institution, which could be cashed if necessary.""This is not a bailout for TEPCO, it is so we can properly pay compensation,"" Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Banri Kaieda said. He said the government would seek quick passage of related bills through the Diet, saying they would be submitted ""as soon as possible.""Meanwhile, TEPCO President Masataka Shimizu said, ""While we will receive government support under the framework, we will continue to prepare to make fair and swift payments to victims.""===Edano hopes for debt waiverChief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano on Friday expressed his hope that financial institutions would partially waive loans extended to TEPCO before the March 11 earthquake.  During the morning press conference, Edano said it would be impossible to get the public on board regarding an injection of public funds to TEPCO if creditors offer no debt forgiveness.Edano answered a question made in relation to the framework for compensation for damage inflicted by the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant accident, which was officially announced by the government earlier in the day. At the same time Edano indicated that a partial waiving of debts by the institutions is an important prerequisite for injection of public funds into TEPCO.""It is a problem of TEPCO asking the financial institutions for cooperation to give up some of the loans and whether the institutions would cooperate or not.    Based on the results of such efforts, we will judge whether the plan [the government has] decided on at this time will be carried out or if a different plan needs to be explored,"" Edano said."

At 2:31 p.m., the radiation level was measured at 300 millisieverts or higher per hour to the north of the door.Both levels were well above the upper limit of 250 millisieverts for an entire year under the plant's safety standards for workers. But the workers who were trying to bring the situation under control at the plant were not informed of the levels.When the Great East Japan Earthquake struck on March 11, the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 reactors all automatically shut down. But the tsunami crippled the emergency generators, leading to a total power failure that prevented the cooling systems from functioning.The TEPCO data also showed high levels of hydrogen may be emitting from the damaged core of the No. 3 reactor on March 13, when TEPCO started injecting seawater to cool the reactor.The following day around 11 a.m., a hydrogen explosion destroyed the upper part of the No. 3 reactor building. Seven TEPCO workers were injured in the blast.TEPCO's public relations department said the company has informed the public that significant levels of radiation have been detected at the plant, but it disclose specific data after a thorough review of the figures is completed.Keiji Miyazaki, professor emeritus of nuclear reactor engineering at Osaka University, criticized TEPCO's policy.He said such important data should be immediately released to ensure the safety of the public and workers at the plant, especially in an emergency like the Fukushima nuclear accident.Miyazaki said TEPCO's decision to conceal the data must be scrutinized.Failure to release radiation data in the early stages of the crisis is said to have delayed the evacuations of communities near the plant.Kiyoshi Sakurai, another nuclear power expert, said a thorough examination is needed not only on TEPCO's unpublished data, but also verbal communications of those involved, instructions issued by the central government and TEPCO, and the communication structure between management and workers at the plant."

And just to remind everyone a dam burst in the Fukushima prefecture just after the earthquake and swept away 1,800 homes, I supposed nobody died due to that?

2210,chaanakya,14 May 2011 11:58 ,"Accurate data destroys optimistic TEPCO assessment, hampers cooling plan2011/05/14        Accurate data shattered the overly optimistic assessment of Tokyo Electric Power Co. concerning the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant and raised doubts about the company's game plan for ending the crisis.Measurements from a recently installed water gauge provided conclusive evidence that the condition of the No. 1 reactor at the plant was much more serious than TEPCO officials have acknowledged until now.TEPCO officials admitted on May 12 that a ""meltdown"" had occurred in the No. 1 reactor. Fuel rods had melted, and the molten fuel accumulated and caused small cracks at the bottom of the reactor pressure container, they said.Until now, TEPCO officials only said that fuel rods were partially damaged and compiled a work schedule in April for restoring a stable cooling system based on that assumption.Despite being unable to obtain accurate measurements from gauges in the reactors damaged in the March 11 Great East Japan Earthquake, TEPCO officials still made those optimistic assumptions.From immediately after the quake, the measurements from the water gauge at the No. 1 reactor showed very little change, casting doubt on the reliability of the instruments.After workers entered the No. 1 reactor building and adjusted the water gauge, the data obtained showed water levels so low that the gauge was unable to measure it.TEPCO officials concluded that water had accumulated in only about 20 percent of the volume of the No. 1 reactor's pressure container.Other specialists had long warned that the situation at the No. 1 reactor was much more serious than the scenario that TEPCO officials were presenting.At a news conference April 1, Shunichi Tanaka, a former vice chairman of the Japan Atomic Energy Commission, said all the fuel rods in the No. 1 reactor had melted, raising the possibility of damage to the pressure container.TEPCO's latest measurements found the temperature of the pressure container was about 100 degrees. If the fuel rods had been exposed because of the low water level, the temperature should have been much higher. The only explanation is that the fuel rods melted, accumulated at the bottom of the pressure container and the melted fuel was cooled by the small volume of water at the bottom.The No. 1 reactor is not the only one with problems. Small cracks have probably also developed at the bottom of the pressure containers of the No. 2 and No. 3 reactors.Evidence of that possibility is the highly contaminated water found in the basements of the turbine buildings of the three reactors as well as underground trenches.The contamination was likely caused by water leaking from the bottoms of the pressure containers of the three reactors.TEPCO officials now admit that the measurements from the water gauges at the pressure containers in the No. 2 and No. 3 reactors are also unreliable.While those water gauges will have to be repaired as soon as possible, TEPCO will also have to review its work schedule for cooling the reactors.That will likely mean rethinking the plan to submerge the containment vessel of the No. 1 reactor in water to cool the pressure container within.About 10,000 tons of water have already been pumped into the No. 1 reactor's pressure container, but about 3,000 tons of that water are unaccounted for. That likely means the water has leaked out of the containment vessel.Moreover, if TEPCO continues to pump in water to the reactors to cool them, water contaminated with radiation will continue to leak out from the cracks at the bottoms of the pressure containers.TEPCO officials have also not denied the possibility that melted fuel has leaked out of the pressure container. That would mean the volume of contaminated water will likely increase, making work in the reactor buildings much more difficult.TEPCO's negligence and concealment is least of their problems but some of them are criminal in nature as well.1. Design faults2. Quality compromise3.Cost cutting in safety areas4.Lack of transparency in giving information during crisis5.Lack of preparedness for the crisis6.Dubious labour practices7.inaccurate data8.concealment of data and gravity of situation9.No end in sight to the crisis and blundering along with so called high tech solutions.10.

""Financial institutions"" should waive loans! Okay, but then they will recoup that cost from the public indirectly.

2225,chaanakya,14 May 2011 19:16 ,"Contaminated nuke plant workers going back on job as safety regs go by waysideSafety standards for workers at the tsunami-hit nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture have been relaxed without any scrutiny, forcing workers to do their jobs without being completely decontaminated, it has emerged.Workers who are struggling to get the Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO)-operated Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant under control as well as experts have expressed grave concern about possible health hazards.Radiation levels on the premises of the power station remain high, with part of the ruins of its No. 3 reactor building -- badly damaged by a hydrogen explosion -- emitting 900 millisieverts of radiation per hour.Safety regulations dictate that when it is estimated workers will be exposed to more than 1 millisievert of radiation per day at a nuclear power plant, companies contracted by the plant operator must submit a work plan specifying the anticipated radiation levels to the local labor standards inspection office, get a receipt stamp and submit a copy of the document to the plant operator.Some contractors then hand copies of the document to their subcontractors as a special permit to perform the work.An employee of one of the subcontractors at Fukushima plant said he worked there without such a special permit and was exposed to 1.3 millisieverts of radiation over a 2 1/2-hour period. Subsequent screening detected radioactive substances on the back of the employee's head and neck, as well as those of about 10 co-workers.They washed with special shampoo at the nuclear crisis operations center about 20 kilometers away from the plant. However, three of them were unable to completely decontaminate themselves. They tried again at a TEPCO facility but failed to completely remove radioactive substances from their bodies. TEPCO subsequently issued a certificate specifying the areas of their bodies contaminated with radioactive material, and they returned to work.In cases where radioactive substances are detected on workers' bodies, their employers are required to submit a report detailing the work they performed and how they were contaminated to the original contractor, which in turn must notify TEPCO.However, the workers' subcontractor has neither submitted such a report to the original contractor nor been instructed by the contractor or TEPCO to do so. The employee has pointed out that the safety regulations have been eased without any scrutiny amid the ongoing crisis.""Both TEPCO and the original contractor appear to be thinking it's natural that we're contaminated with radioactive substances, considering our working environment,"" he lamented.""Many of us are eager to help get the plant under control, and think we can't avoid being contaminated. But frankly speaking, we're concerned,"" he added.TEPCO said the certificate specifying the areas of workers' bodies contaminated is issued if high levels of radiation are detected during screening, but claimed that such workers are completely decontaminated before returning to work.I am sure NPBA activists would be quick to show concern at such serious lapses in a ""high Tech"" industry  rather than asking Y or N type answers."

Within an hour, it was hit by at least two rounds of tsunami waves. The external power supply was then shut down, disabling the emergency core cooling system from injecting water at 4:36 p.m.Prime Minister Naoto Kan declared the country’s first state of nuclear emergency in the evening and residents near the plant were asked to evacuate.Workers entered the No. 1 reactor building in the night to assess damage to the reactor but a few seconds later their dosimeter’s alarm was triggered, according to the sources at Tokyo Electric Power Co. The building was believed to be filled with steam with high radiation dose, prompting the workers to evacuate.Based on dosimeter readings, radiation was estimated at around 300 millisieverts per hour, according to the sources, a result suggesting a large amount of radioactive materials from nuclear fuel in the reactor was already released.It has been thought that power loss failed the cooling system at the No. 1 reactor, releasing highly radioactive steam from the reactor pressure vessel.This scenario assumes that pressure inside the reactor had built up and damaged piping and other facilities, a process that is thought to require a much longer time before such building is filled with steam.A source at TEPCO admitted the possibility of key facilities having been compromised before the tsunami waves, saying, ‘‘The quake’s trembling may have caused damage to the pressure vessel or pipes.’‘The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency has so far said the reactor withstood shaking but tsunami of an unexpected scale caused power loss, which led to an explosion.On the night of March 11, TEPCO did not yet take the step of opening vents of the containment vessel to relieve pressure that was supposed to be rising, a move that it took in the morning the following day that led to the release of radioactive steam from the vessel.Inside the No. 1 reactor, water level was falling from the night of March 11. TEPCO sprayed a large volume of water but failed to recover water level, leading to exposure of fuel and a meltdown of the reactor core.Subsequently, zirconium, a metal covering fuel triggered a chemical reaction with steam, generating hydrogen and leading to the explosion at the reactor building at 3:36 p.m. on March 12."
2250,chaanakya,15 May 2011 15:46 ,"Trouble delayed cold shutdown of Hamaoka nuclear reactorSunday 15th May, 06:53 PM JST SHIZUOKA —Chubu Electric Power Co said Sunday that cooling system trouble delayed the cold shutdown of the No. 5 reactor at its Hamaoka power plant in Shizuoka Prefecture for about two hours earlier in the day, while ruling out any external release of radioactive substances.Seawater leaked into a steam condenser at the reactor, which cools and turns steam from the turbines into water, apparently due to damage to its piping, prompting the utility to switch to another system to cool and stabilize the reactor and complete the work shortly past noon, it said.The No. 5 unit was the last active nuclear reactor at the plant located in the Pacific coastal city of Omaezaki to come to a stable condition with an internal temperature below 100 C, the benchmark for cold shutdown.The utility serving central Japan halted operation of the plant—its only nuclear facility located around 180 kilometers southwest of Tokyo—on Saturday, following an unprecedented government request due to fears of another nuclear disaster in the event of a large earthquake in the area, which lies on a major active fault line.The ongoing nuclear crisis at Tokyo Electric Power Co’s Fukushima Daiichi power plant on the Pacific coast around 220 km northeast of Tokyo was triggered by the devastating March 11 quake and tsunami.The Nagoya-based firm said it had found Saturday evening, after a measuring instrument indicated abnormalities around 4:30 p.m., that around 400 tons of seawater had flowed into the condenser of the No. 5 reactor.

2251,harbans,15 May 2011 15:52 ,Chanakya ji that (report) is exactly what i said yesterday. There is a need for assessment at the design level. The jump however to proclaiming the Nuclear industry as unsafe is a leap too far. I am sure you will admit there are lots of people who do create paranoia for vested purposes. That is what needs also to be countered.

Any organization that claims ZERO accident/ Zero incident is a fraud. Risk can only be minimized, never done away. Minimization is done by good transparent management, good sound engineering design, emperical considerations and awareness. Whether one flies in an aircraft, crosses the road, cuts onions, does milling, works or lives near a nuclear plant, life is NEVER without an element of risk. However paranoia and falsification of information to the risks also negate the very purpose. IMHO thats what Amber G, GP and others have tried to address to quite an extent. JMHT."

2254,chaanakya,15 May 2011 18:27 ,"Meltdown occurred at Fukushima No. 1 reactor 16 hours after March 11 quakeSunday 15th May, 08:51 PM JSTTOKYO —A nuclear fuel meltdown at the No. 1 reactor of the crisis-hit Fukushima Daiichi power plant is believed to have occurred around 16 hours after the March 11 quake and tsunami crippled the complex in northeastern Japan, Tokyo Electric Power Co said Sunday.The reactor, the fuel of which was found Thursday to have largely melted, was already in a critical state at 6:50 a.m. on March 12 with most of its fuel having melted and fallen to the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel, the plant operator said based on its provisional assessment.The reactor automatically halted shortly after the 2:46 p.m. earthquake, but its water level dropped to the upper part of the fuel rods and the temperature began to rise around 6 p.m. The damage to the fuel had begun by 7:30 p.m. with most of it having melted by 6:50 a.m. the following day, the utility said.While the utility is aiming to bring the worst nuclear accident in Japan under control in around six to nine months from mid-April, it has no choice but to abandon a plan to flood and cool the No. 1 reactor’s containment vessel as holes have been created in the pressure vessel by the melted fuel, an adviser to Prime Minister Naoto Kan indicated earlier Sunday.But the government will keep intact the firm’s timetable for stabilizing the crisis, Goshi Hosono, tasked with handling the nuclear crisis, told TV programs.On the original plan to completely submerge the 4-meter-tall fuel rods by filling the vessel with water, Hosono said, ‘‘We should not cause the (radioactive) water to flow into the sea by taking such a measure,’’ alluding to the holes.Hosono said that the government will instead consider ways to decontaminate water used to cool fuel in the reactor so that the water can be reused.The remarks were made after TEPCO found a pool of water over 4 meters deep, which could be highly contaminated and total 3,000 tons, in the basement of the No. 1 reactor building, suggesting water poured into the reactor core may be seeping through holes created by melted fuel. The water is then suspected to have leaked from the containment vessel or suppression pools, which form the vessel, into piping.In a related revelation concerning one of the major mix-ups after the natural disaster knocked out power at the six-reactor complex, TEPCO and other sources said the same day that the utility had assembled 69 power supply vehicles by March 12 at the plant but to no avail.The inability to use the vehicles caused a delay in the damage control work at the plant, significantly worsening the emergency.TEPCO earlier said it had tried to connect the vehicles to power-receiving equipment, a procedure necessary to operate pumps that would pour water into the reactors to cool them. But workers failed to carry out the task because the equipment was submerged in seawater from the tsunami, creating the risk of shorting out.TEPCO’s account is at variance with the one given by the government’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, which mentioned the first arrival of such a vehicle on the evening of March 11 but stopped mentioning it the following day as the focus of attention had shifted to how to let out radioactive steam to relieve pressure that had built up inside the containment vessel of the No. 1 reactor.The different versions of the story given by TEPCO and the agency might come to a head as investigations progress to determine why efforts to immediately contain the crisis failed."

It concealed data and members were advised to believe TEPCO data even though news contrary to that were posted.The possibility of meltdown was not on some science from  someone's  musharraf but based on LOCA and radioactive data and radioactive isotopes like Cs , Sr and Pu. Be kind enough to go through previous pages.Now , the assertion of meltdown is not based on TEPCO's admission but NISA of METI and advisor to Govt who have indicated what actually happened. The matter is under investigation to determine the sequence of events and TEPCO's responses to it and to draw appropriate conclusions.I do not claim to have mentioned meltdown first but it was Sanku who mentioned. SO no need to give me credit.What all one is doing here to take data as it comes out through various news reports and press releases and try to understand what happened?  There is hardly canteen discussion here from me, though you seem to have carried it a little too far."
2258,chaanakya,15 May 2011 19:08 ,"Of course when  TEPCO also admits it , that helps. But  there were initial indications that TEPCO's responses were guarded, short of transparent for the reason of legal issues and possibility of huge compensation and making TEPCO legally liable for all the negligence and willful defaults.Now that they have aligned their revelations in line with what was otherwise reported by various experts in news media, I am sure further scrutiny of data would bring out the full extent of disaster."

We all had looked at the same data. All I am asking is that even post-facto please explain how the deduction of meltdown was made.  It will advance science to know the method of meltdown deductions employed. Cs, Sr and Pu are present in the spent rods as well - so that by itself is not evidence.I would be impressed and learn something if such analysis is presented, minus the ""rant"" element.  OTOH, lack of such analysis would lead me to conclude that much is being made of a random prediction among many coming true.[recall that the pages are full of predictions, including ""dead men walking"" etc.  We can calculate the percentage of predictions coming true.]  There is hardly canteen discussion here from me, though you seem to have carried it a little too far.You'd be surprised at who all sit at that canteen table once in a while.
