rirumore,28/09/2018,"oh my god. this is actually taken from parking lot of a mall called Palu Grand Mall. my house is not far from here and actually near the coast too, the right side of the bay taken from this video. In fact Palu is a small city and surrounded by bay and mountains. I hope my family safe and can evacuate to higher ground. thank god finally they could contacted me. only for 3 minutes tho but it made me a bit relief knowing them safe. they are still staying outside of the house, earthquake still happening as I am writing this, with smaller scales. 5 SR, still worrying tho"
threebellies,28/09/2018,"May our creator be with any of those impacted by this. Love from North America to the people of Indonesia, and any other south East Asian countries impacted."
iryaaa,28/09/2018,"Dude are you from Palu? I've been looking for news and official reports from either BMKG or govt. spokesman and I think the tsunami is just in a small scale so nothing to worry about from the shore. Confirmed by govt Spokeswoman, tsunami was real, reached 3 meters high.
My thoughts and prayers for you and your family, hope they're safe."
rirumore,28/09/2018,"yeah, most of my families except my brother and sister are in Palu. Currently I'm living in Jakarta and keep contacting with my sister. I'm 100% sure this video is real, because I know that mall, and it's true it's located right in front of the shore. Yeah it's a small scale but my house is only like 200-300 meters from the shore too, enough to make me really worry. But there is nothing I can do except praying for the best and keep up with the news. Thank you for your kindness. thank god finally they could contacted me. only for 3 minutes tho but it made me a bit relief knowing them safe. they are still staying outside of the house, earthquake still happening as I am writing this, with smaller scales. 5 SR, still worrying tho"
jbrandyberry,28/09/2018,I hope your family is safe.
rirumore,28/09/2018,"thanks dude, that's just how i express things through text, so i hope everyone bear with me"
jbrandyberry,28/09/2018,"Yea we all know what you meant. Shit, I've heard of grammar nazis before, but apparently we have emoji nazis now. Fuck all that bullshit. Everyone with an ounce of common sense knew what you meant. Again, I hope everything is alright with your family out there"
jbrandyberry,28/09/2018,"Now I don't know if you mean ""fake"" as in the timing is wrong (i.e. previous tsunami) or whether you mean someone used CGI to make this video, but the location is as good as verified as you can get."
kazuasauras,28/09/2018,stay safe bruh
satire,28/09/2018,Looks like Palu is where it hit. I believe this is the location of the filming of the first video. Approximate location of the cameraman. Zoomed out to show city. It has also been speculated that the shape of the bay might have played a role in increasing the severity and size of the tsunami. Zoomed out to show entire bay. Epicenter of earthquake and location of Palu. They probably had very little warning
rirez,28/09/2018,"Just to add some of the nuance, it wasn't even just a couple quakes... Oh no, the whole area got freaking carpet bombed. Just powerful quakes repeatedly for five hours."
giraffenmensch,28/09/2018,Yeah. It's horrible! Many people instinctively run outside during a large quake like that. Especially in a place like Indonesia where many buildings are not build to code and people would feel safer outside than trusting the structure. Then the tsunami got would have hit.
angrygroceries,28/09/2018,"Not only that, but after the quakes local authorities said ""no chance of tsunami. So people relaxed a bit, and then this."
syhr8,28/09/2018,"That is a very large tsunami for the magnitude and mechanism of the quake. Local bathymetry and topography can play a big part in amplifying the effects. Palu is at the top of a bay, which can focus the energy of the tsunami."
semantiks,28/09/2018,"That's crazy, I would expect it to lose energy bouncing around that narrow bay unless it came right down the line (Oh, apparently it did). What are the odds man, that's brutal. The bay that normally sheltered them from rough seas is basically a megaphone from the one direction, and thats where the quake happened."
surfnaked,28/09/2018,"That bay looks pretty deep, so if it's a straight shot, looks like it is, that would be focusing the tsunami like a hose nozzle. This is a real disaster. I hope as many as can be are safe"
Leberkleister13,28/09/2018,"Unbelievably hard to find anything on TV, all the news channels where I live are doing live coverage of the US Supreme Court circus."
SpasticCoulomb,28/09/2018,"Bbc world did coverage, alongside the facebook hack, though most of their program was congress fracas."
khavi,28/09/2018,I'm amazed I only heard about this an hour ago. I've been checking Twitter all day (which is usually pretty good for breaking news) and it's been dominated by the Kavenaugh hearing. The tsunami totally flew under the radar
Necrosis_KoC,28/09/2018,"Judging by the water in the streets when it hits, that wasn't the first wave..."
satire,28/09/2018,I'm scared that there might be heavy causalities due to how close this city was to the epicenter. Very little warning time.
iryaaa,28/09/2018,"I cannot confirm this information, afaik based on our BMKG (=USGS), the tsunami alert had been called off but some sea waves resulted from the major quake did some damage to the shore.

In other words, tsunami might had occured albeit in a small magnitude.

e: tsunami was real, 3 meters high.

Also the news mainly covered about damages on the mainland/cities and not on the shore."
surfnaked,28/09/2018,If you look at the shape of the bay and location of the quake. They might as well have been looking up the barrel of a gun.
Semantiks,28/09/2018,That last one looks like it was taken from a boat at sea that tried to return to Palu after the quake... to find this.
djmftw,28/09/2018,"That hit SO HARD....

It just takes one moment in time for total chaos. This is awful."
satire,28/09/2018,The epicenter was just north of the bay. They likely had very little warning time.
freshpicked,28/09/2018,Those poor people.
realpoopy,28/09/2018,It looks like the top of a mosque fell off
whatagee,28/09/2018,I'm confused as to where the people were running in that twitter video when they were already on the highest elevation it seemed like?
tryoxin,28/09/2018,I have never actually watched a tsunami hit. Fuck.
iamdwilight,28/09/2018,Fuck that's horrifying.
caliguardgirl,28/09/2018,Oh my god this....is terrible.
steakandshake,28/09/2018,Fuck...
serena,28/09/2018,I wish the person would've filmed horizontally.
seismatter,28/09/2018,"For the most up to date earthquake information, see the USGS event page. For more details on the impact of this earthquake, see this AP article.

This M7.5 earthquake was shallow and only 50 miles north of the city of Palu (~200k), so a large population would have experienced strong shaking. Heavy rains might make triggered landslides more likely. The fault that ruptured was strike-slip and on land *so a significant tsunami would not be triggered. [*Clarification: Reports of a local tsunami are coming in, which is still possible from strike-slip fault motion. The NTWC (https://www.tsunami.gov/) shows no warning since no tsunami impact is expected in the broader region that they oversee.] USGS currently has this as Yellow PAGER alert, meaning significant fatalities (10-100 people) and economic losses ($10-100 million) are possible.

A M6.1 foreshock resulted in one fatality and 10 injured, along with damage to houses.

Collapsed houses due to the mainshock are now being reported.

Local tsunami reported (video), after their geophysical agency lifted the tsunami warning. Landmarks have been identified in this video to be Palu and the billboard is for a legislative candidate running for this current election. Be cautious of unverified information.

This local tsunami is larger than what is expected for a strike-slip fault. With further analysis of the data USGS has settled on a almost perfectly North-South oriented fault that would have ruptured. This is consistent with the mapped Palu-Koro fault. The sides of that fault (red line) would have moved past each other, meaning the motion or push to create a wave would be oriented in a N-S direction too. Looking at the map, the southern part of the red line ends by a narrow bay also oriented roughly N-S. The city of Palu, where the video was filmed, is at the head of this bay. Tsunami waves can be greater in height in a narrow channel or harbor than on an open coastline. These factors could have contributed to the larger than expected local tsunami impact. Alternatively, and completely speculatively, triggered landslides can also cause tsunamis especially in a narrow bay such as the 1958 megatsunami at Lituya Bay in Alaska."
reverendmoist,28/09/2018,Great comment. Any word on the tsunami source? Underwater landslide?
masam,28/09/2018,"Seismologist, here.

Take a look at the geography of Palu, there's that giant peninsula sticking out about 100 km north of Palu.

There was left-lateral strike slip motion on an almost perfectly north-south fault that runs just along the coast. That peninsula happens to lie on the opposite side of the fault as the rest of that whole mountain arc, and it's sticking out perpendicular to the coast.

I'm curious if the strength of the tsunami wasn't just caused by block motion and Palu's unfortunate location at the end of a north-south bay, but maybe that peninsula acted as a literal wave machine, plowing the water column as it slid southward?"
slayertip,28/09/2018,"Anyone know if theres any cell phone coverage at the moment? i can imagine the signals are tough since everyones calling everyone, been trying to call my dad for the past hour, idk where he is in indonesia, but hopefully he stays safe"
rirumore,28/09/2018,"no, dude. only one operator barely works there. I pray for the safety of your dad too"
slayertip,28/09/2018,"thank you, he's meant to return back home to melbourne in two days, i miss him :/ its been a rough few months without him."
purpleyam,28/09/2018,Once you drive out of that tiny city signal becomes choppy. Beyond it is some really remote parts of Sulawesi.
fapfabs,28/09/2018,how is there no tsunami warning on www.tsunami.org when the vids clearly show some?
tobbyforester,28/09/2018,"Comment here gives some speculation. In short: the tsunami might be due to an earthquake-triggered landslide to the ocean, or due to the fault line being along a bay and tsunami being very localized to just one end of the bay. Bay acting as a ""funnel"" to increase tsunami height."
dr_dry,28/09/2018,"well ..BMKG (Indonesian counterpart of USGS) is currently lifting the tsunami alert,

i dont know about the wave that hitting the coastline is counted as tsunami, the wave heights is just about 3m."
drychicken,28/09/2018,"True, but 3m wall of water will fuck your day up fast. Hope everyone is ok"
dr_dry,28/09/2018,yup..thank god that wave didnt get more higher
kaptainkeel,28/09/2018,"From what I've seen, it's likely due to the end of the fault that slipped being in a shallow bay. Shallower water = higher tsunami, meaning you could have a local tsunami in the bay (where the most popular video from Palu was taken at) while not having a regional tsunami."
frediesweeter,28/09/2018,"Thing is, strike slips, even of this magnitude don’t usually cause tsunamis. I read there have been heavy rains there, so perhaps a large landslide in the bay, like that tsunami in Greenland last fall."
hairycactus,28/09/2018,"It was a localized tsunami ""wave-train"" caused by a cascading underwater landslide in Palu Bay, triggered by earthquake tremors (main shock & aftershocks) -- see the report excerpted at the bottom. As of 29 Sep 2018 morning Palu time, the death toll was 384. The search teams have not finished uncovering & counting all the bodies. UDPATE (29 Sep 2018, 10.50 pm Palu time): Death toll is now at least 405.

As opposed to the 26 Dec 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami which was caused by a displacement of a large volume of seawater due to vertical movements of a megathrust fault just off Aceh, the tectonic fault implicated in the Palu quake is a strike-slip fault with largely horizontal movement, which normally won't trigger tsunamis.

This is probably why the local authorities lifted the tsunami warning, ie. after confirming the location of the epicentre & ascertaining the type of fault involved.

Also, I happened to see a ChannelNewsAsia 'live' TV report last night (~10.30 pm Palu time) where the American geologist Kerry Sieh was interviewed on webcam. At that time, there was still no info as to what really caused the tsunami. When asked why the Palu authorities ""prematurely"" lifted the tsunami warning, Prof Sieh said something to the effect that it was probably because no tsunami was observed at Palu more than 40 mins after the 7.5-magnitude main shock had occurred.

The TV report further indicated that the tsunami lasted only a very short time -- the seawater started receding after some 15-20 mins."
mugaiwaralee,28/09/2018,Why does this post have literally TENS OF THOUSANDS of fewer upvotes than the small blurb about Trump? What is wrong with this sub? THIS is world news. Not what the POTUS had for breakfast.
freeradical,28/09/2018,Very clearly being manipulated for political propaganda.
myne,28/09/2018,"Trump says tsunamis are bad.

Wapo: Here's why tsunamis are good.

Politfact: Mostly false

modestradio,28/09/2018,Jesus 7.5 is humongous. Let's hope there is not a tsunami and very low casulties!
rirumore,28/09/2018,"my parents and most of my families are still in there. And all of communication line (except 1 operator, XL) got cut off, but according to my friend, barely, we can connect to them. I just got called by my mom for 11 seconds before it got cut again. ;___;

edit: my relatives who can be contacted said it still keeps happening. God, my parents."
rizarizariza,28/09/2018,"I hope your family is okay, bro. I saw the pictures of falling homes and damage buildings, it's saddening."

America is so self-centered right now."
paul,28/09/2018,"Earthquakes topple homes, prompt Indonesia tsunami warning"
purpleyam,28/09/2018,"Man, there aren't many buildings there to take shelter during a tsunami. Most are low rise hotels that has 10 levels maybe, around 10 or 20 of them. And this mall has only four levels or so."
trowzers,28/09/2018,"Looking at the area on Google streetview, the vast majority of buildings there are only 1 storey and it's a very flat area so not many places to run to quickly. The lack of followup stories coming out of the city is also very worrying."
robin,28/09/2018,bridge collapsed followed by tsunami.
doublepenetrating,28/09/2018,Hope people are alright
