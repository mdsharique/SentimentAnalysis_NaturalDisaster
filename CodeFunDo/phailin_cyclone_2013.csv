If you have emergency numbers post them here. There is a big difference between sustained and gust wind speeds. Gusts may be upto 1.5 times the sustained wind speeds. IMD is reporting mostly sustained wind speeds. NEW DELHI: The weather office may be underestimating the severity of a cyclone which is hurtling towards the east coast, a meteorologist warned on Friday, adding that it could be worse than Hurricane Katrina which devastated parts of the United States in 2005.Cyclone Phailin is forecast to hit the coast between Kalingapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Paradip in Odisha late on Saturday with a maximum wind speed of 220kmph (135mph), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its latest bulletin.However, both London-based Tropical Storm and the US navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Centre forecast winds reaching 315kmph (195mph) on landfall, classifying Phailin as a Category 5 storm — the most powerful .""Phailin is already worse than what the IMD is forecasting. A recent satellite estimate put Phailin's current intensity on par with 2005's Hurricane Katrina in the United States,"" said Eric Holthaus, meteorologist for Quartz, a US-based online magazine which covers global economy-related issues.""Everything I know as a meteorologist tells me this is the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane — among the strongest on earth in 2013. That would mean Phailin could be the strongest cyclone ever measured in the Indian Ocean.""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/indi ... 983892.cms"

The collectors of the coastal districts have been directed to ensure zero casualty and evacuate people from low lying areas to cyclone shelters by today evening, said PK Mohapatra, state special relief commissioner.The Andhra Pradesh government has put collectors of all the nine coastal districts in the state on high alert and ordered evacuation of 64,000 people from low-lying areas.State revenue minister, N Raghuveera Reddy, who reviewed the situation, said that about 40,000 people in Visakhapatnam, 2,000 in Srikakulam and 4,000 in Vizianagaram districts were being evacuated on Friday. About 850 cyclone shelters were identified to accommodate the distressed people.While the Odisha government has cancelled the Puja holidays of all government employees, the government employees and the staff of power utilities in Andhra Pradesh, who were on a strike in protest against the proposed bifurcation of the state, have withdrawn their in view of the impending cyclone.Round-the-clock control rooms have been opened at state, district and mandal levels in the two states to monitor the situation. Fishermen, who had ventured into the sea, have been asked to return to the coast.The cyclone is expected to wreak extensive damage to kutcha houses, standing crops and power and communication lines and cause disruption of rail and road traffic.The vulnerable seven districts in Odisha are Ganjam, Gajapati, Puri, Jagatsingpur, Kendrapara, Nayagarh and Khurda. Besides, evacuation orders have also been given for Bhadrak and Balasore districts. Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik appealed to the people not to panic and called for united efforts to fight the impending calamity.Navy, Air Force, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) are ready for relief and rescue operations, Patnaik said.The Bhubaneswar met office has asked to hoist Local Cautionary Signal Number Three (LC-III) at all ports in Odisha and signalled Cyclone Warning-10 for the state coast.The storm surge with height of around three meter above astronomical tide would inundate low lying areas of Ganjam, Khurda, Puri and Jagatsinghpur districts of Odisha during landfall, it predicted.About 28 NDRF teams are put to operation in the state to carry out the rescue and relief operations.Phailin likely to hit coast at 6 p.m. tomorrowCyclone Phailin — the biggest cyclone in years to hit Odisha — is expected to make landfall near Gopalpur in Ganjam district in the eastern State after crossing an area between Paradip in Odisha and Kalingapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.Five districts were in the eye of the storm with IMD chief Dr. L.S. Rathore identifying Ganjam, Khurda, Puri and Jagatsinghpur districts in Odisha and Srikakalum in Andhra Pradesh as those that is likely to be worst hit.Mr. Rathore said the cyclone storm over east central Bay of Bengal currently lay 450 km southeast of Gopalpur and warned that it will be accompanied by a storm surge of up to three metres in the districts that will bear the brunt.The Odisha health department cancelled holidays and leaves of all doctors in view of the impending situation even as the State government set a target of “zero casualty” and ordered speedy evacuation of people in seven coastal districts.The East Coast Railway planned to regulate and cancel about 24 passenger trains between Visakhapatnam and Bhadrak on the Howrah-Chennai Main Line route on Saturday.64,000 evacuated in A.P.Authorities began evacuating 64,000 people from the low-lying areas of three vulnerable districts in Andhra Pradesh, State Revenue Minister N.

9,nawabs,11 Oct 2013 21:53 ,"Cyclone Phailin is half the size of India and strengthening quickly as it heads for landhttp://qz.com/134028/cyclone-phailin-is ... -for-land/By Eric HolthausThe Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), a Hawaii-based forecasting outpost of the US Navy, says Phailin is undergoing “extreme rapid intensification.” While strengthening, the storm has grown to nearly half the size of India itself (image via University of Wisconsin): The storm’s growth, both in size and in strength, is expected to continue until landfall. The latest forecast from JTWC shows Phailin hitting land on Saturday near Brahmapur, India, at the strength of a category 5 hurricane. That forecast may, in fact, be conservative. Waters over the Bay of Bengal are exceptionally warm right now—more than 28°C, which is the generally agreed upon threshold above which rapid intensification of tropical cyclones is most likely. Two reasons why Phailin may pack a particularly hefty punch: an ample finish to the 2013 monsoon season has saturated soils along India’s coastline, aggravating Phailin’s flooding potential. Plus, a just-completed ‘eyewall replacement cycle’ could act to further grow Phailin’s size and extent of storm surge damage. "

The National Institute of Amateur Radio (NIAR) which was set up with the initiative taken by Rajiv Gandhi in 1983 has trained several ham radio operators so far in the country.In Odisha, as many as 200 trained ham radio operators have been put on alert to rise to the occasion. Ham radio operators help in rescue operations when other means of communications may or may not be working. ""Ham volunteers not only in Odisha, but all over the country have been asked to be available if their services are needed. As many as 40 have already volunteers have offered to go to any place if needed,"" NIAR director S Ram Mohan told The Times of India.For now VU2JOS Jose Jacob and VU2MCW Mukesh Kumar Gola will reach Odisha by Saturday. ""Since the training for the ham operators in Odisha has been given over the years, the job would mainly be to see that there are no technical glitches,"" Ram Mohan said.The amateur radio operators from NIAR had helped the Odisha government in critical times when the state was hit by the super cyclone in 1999. Even when the chief minister's residence was without power supply and all telecommunications had got cut, ham radio operators came to the rescue helping the state be in contact with the outside world.Following the help that was rendered the government took steps to get as many as 200 ham radio operators trained so that they can be depended upon for communication during rescue operations.Following the alert about Cyclone Phailin, the Odisha state government got in touch with NIAR, Hyderabad to alert the entire network of ham radio operators and participate in the operations that may have to be taken up. ""We have eight stations which have been put on active alert while there are 28 stations which are there as back-up at various places in the country,"" Ram Mohan said.Usually during a disaster, Ham radio operators who pitch tent at different places share information over the radio so that rescue operations can be carried out.""Right now, our concentration is on Pradip Port. The amateur radio network is being activated to be of assistance at the right place if the cyclone hits the area,"" Ram Mohan said."

There will be a crippling storm surge of 4-6 meters (14-20 feet), as well as wind gusts to 250 kph, near the landfall point of Phailin which is expected across northeastern India on Saturday.Anyone residing in the states of Orissa or eastern Andhra Pradesh is encouraged to take proper precautions and prepare for life-threatening conditions.At present: Phalin is packing winds sustained at 260 kph (160 mph) with gusts to 320 kph (200 mph)...Phailin has the potential maintain Category 5 intensify until the point of landfall. If that is the case, the impacts will be catastrophic.The areas expected to be thrashed by Phailan this weekend, specifically in an area from the cities of Visakhapatnam to Brahmapur is home to millions of people.After making landfall in northeastern India on Saturday, Phailin will track northwestward through interior India and weaken Sunday into Monday, where heavy rain will continue to cause flooding and even mudslides through Monday.>>>Looks as bad as 1999..(There was one almost on this  day in 1741 which killed about 300,000 people, and counted as one of world's worst)"

49,nawabs,12 Oct 2013 08:36 ,"http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMa ... rynum=25491999 Odisha Cyclone That terrible storm hit Northeast India in the Indian state of Odisha (formerly called Orissa) near the city of Bhubaneswar, as a Category 4 storm with 155 mph winds on October 29, 1999. The mighty cyclone, which peaked at Category 5 strength with 160 mph winds and a 912 mb central pressure shortly before landfall, drove a storm surge of 26 feet (8 meters) onto the coast. The storm stalled just inland, dumping torrential rains on portions of India already saturated from the landfall of Category 4 Tropical Cyclone 04B just twelve days before. The catastrophe killed 9,658 people and left $2.5 billion in damage (1999 dollars), India's most expensive and fourth deadliest tropical cyclone in the past 100 years. Although Phailin is expected to hit the same province of India that the great 1999 Odisha Cyclone hit, Phailin's landfall location is predicted to fall about 100 miles farther to the south, in a region where the coast is not as low-lying. This should keep the death toll due to storm surge much lower compared to the 1999 Odisha Cyclone, where more than 70% of the deaths occurred due to the storm surge. The latest storm surge forecast from IMD  predicts a peak surge under 3', but this is much too low, considering Phailin's recent round of rapid intensification. Phailin's heavy rains will be capable of causing great destruction, as did the rains from the 1999 Odisha cyclone. More than 2,000 of the deaths from that storm occurred due to fresh water flooding in the town of Padmapur, located more than 150 miles from the coast. Deforestation was cited as a contributing cause to these destructive floods that killed 36% of the town's population. "

59,rajanb,12 Oct 2013 11:16 ,"flippin hell    Cyclone Phailin is half the size of India and strengthening quickly as it heads for landhttp://qz.com/134028/cyclone-phailin-is-half-the-size-of-india-and-strengthening-quickly-as-it-heads-for-land/An atmospheric beast is forming in the Bay of Bengal and heading straight for India. Cyclone Phailin—pronounced pie-leen; it’s a Thai word for “sapphire”—has exploded from tropical storm strength to potentially the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane. +Meteorologists can’t precisely determine Phailin’s current strength because there are no “hurricane hunter“ aircraft taking direct measurements of storms in the Indian Ocean basin. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), a Hawaii-based forecasting outpost of the US Navy, says Phailin is undergoing “extreme rapid intensification.” +While strengthening, the storm has grown to nearly half the size of India itself (image via University of Wisconsin): That forecast may, in fact, be conservative. Waters over the Bay of Bengal are exceptionally warm right now—more than 28°C, which is the generally agreed upon threshold above which rapid intensification of tropical cyclones is most likely. +The last storm of this magnitude to hit India was the 1999 Odisha cyclone, which killed more than 10,000 people and caused $4.5 billion in damage. That storm hit the same general area that Phailin appears to be headed, at about Phailin’s predicted strength. +India’s official meteorological service has had trouble keeping up with the quickly strengthening storm. In the agency’s latest official update, Phailin’s current intensity was listed as 50 mph (80 kph), weaker than current satellite estimates. That discrepancy could lead to local confusion and an underestimating of the storm’s true threat. For example, the predicted landfall intensity commonly quoted in local media on Thursday of 105-115 mph (175-185 kph) was perhaps 40 mph (70 kph) too low, according to the latest JTWC forecast and my own assessment. Also, the government’s official storm surge forecast shows a maximum value at landfall of a little over 3 feet (1 meter). The 1999 cyclone produced a storm surge of 26 feet (8 meters), a value that is not impossible with Phailin. +Still, India’s government has begun mobilizing preparations, such as the cancellation of Puja holiday celebrations and the activation of state disaster rapid action forces. More than a quarter million people have been moved to higher ground. +Should the storm maintain its current strength—or strengthen even further—India could be facing a true catastrophe. A worst case scenario would have Phailin tracking slightly eastward of its current forecasted track, toward Kolkata and the Ganges Delta of Bangladesh, which is home to tens of millions of people living just a few meters above sea level. +Storm surge and freshwater flooding from heavy rains are generally the biggest threats from landfalling cyclones in the Bay of Bengal region, home to the most deadly storms in modern history. Two reasons why Phailin may pack a particularly hefty punch: an ample finish to the 2013 monsoon season has saturated soils along India’s coastline, aggravating Phailin’s flooding potential. Plus, a just-completed ‘eyewall replacement cycle’ could act to further grow Phailin’s size and extent of storm surge damage.	+In the absence of direct measurements, meteorologists use satellites to estimate the strength of storms like Phailin. One reliable technique shows Phailin is continuing to strengthen and may have already achieved the status of a “super cyclone,” the highest on India’s scale and the equivalent of a category 4 or 5 hurricane.	+At one point (2 a.m. Friday, India time), one satellite-based measure of Phailin’s strength estimated the storm’s central pressure at 910.2 millibars, with sustained winds of 175 mph (280 kph). If those numbers were verified by official forecast agencies, they would place Phailin on par with 2005′s Hurricane Katrina, and break the record for the most intense cyclone in Indian Ocean recorded history.	+As of 8 p.m. Friday, India time, Phailin had indeed officially reached Category 5 status, with an intensity of 918mb and sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph). That ties the wind speed record set by the 1999 cyclone at its peak, currently the most intense storm ever to make landfall in India.	+02BP (9)"

67,Lilo,12 Oct 2013 12:27 ,"How are low pressure system classified in India? What are the differences between low, depression and cyclone?The low pressure system over Indian region are classified based on the maximum sustained winds speed associated with the system and the pressure deficit/ number of closed isobars associated with the system. The pressure criteria is used, when the system is over land and wind criteria is used, when the system is over the sea. The system is called as low if there is one closed isobar in the interval of 2 hPa. It is called depression, if there are two closed isobars, a deep depression, if there are three closed isobars and cyclonic storm if there are four or more closed isobars. The detailed classification based on wind criteria are given in the Table below. Considering wind criteria, the system with wind speed of 17-27 knots is called as depression and the low pressure system with maximum sustained 3 minutes surface winds between 28-33 knots is called a deep depression. The system with maximum sustained 3 minutes surface winds of 34 knots or more is called as cyclonic stormWhat is the damage potential of a very severe cyclonic storm (91-119 Knots or 168-221 Kmph) and what are the suggested actions?Structures: Extensive damage to all types Kutcha houses, some damage to old badly managed Pucca structures. Potential threat from flying objects.Communication and power: Extensive uprooting of power and communication poles.Road/Rail: Disruption of rail / road link at several places.Agriculture: Extensive damage to standing crops plantations, orchards. Blowing down of Palm and Coconut trees. Uprooting of large bushy trees.Marine Interests: Phenomenal seas with wave heights more than 14m. Movement in motor boats and small ships not advisable.Coastal Zone: Storm surge up to 2 – 5 m, Inundation may extend up to 10-15 Km over specific areas. Large boats and ships may get torn from their moorings, country crafts may get detached from mooringsOverall Damage Category: ExtensiveSuggested Actions: Fishermen not to venture into sea. Evacuation from coastal areas essential. Diversion / suspension of rail traffic may be required.What is the damage potential of a super cyclonic storm 120 Knots (222 Kmph) & above? What are the suggested actions?Structures: Extensive damage to non-concrete residential and industrial building. Structural damage to concrete structures. Air full of large projectiles.Communication and power: Uprooting of power and communication poles. Total disruption of communication and power supply.Road/Rail: Extensive damage to Kutcha roads and some damage to poorly repaired pucca roads. Large scale submerging of coastal roads due to flooding and sea water inundation. Total disruption of railway and road traffic due to major damages to bridges, signals and railway tracks. Washing away of rail / road links at several places.Agriculture: Total destruction of standing crops / orchards, uprooting of large trees and blowing away of palm and coconut crowns, stripping of tree barks.Marine Interests: Phenomenal seas with wave heights more than 14m. All shipping activity unsafe.Coastal Zone: Extensive damage to port installations. Storm surge more than 5m, Inundation up to 40 Km in specific areas and extensive beach erosion. All ships torn from their moorings. Flooding of escape routes.Overall Damage Category: CatastrophicSuggested Actions: Fishermen not to venture into sea. Large scale evacuations needed. Total stoppage of rail and road traffic needed in vulnerable areas^^Disha ji,Indian IMD classification is different to Saffir-Simpson classification that US uses. So one cannot directly equate a super cyclone to be category 5 hurricane technically speaking or a very severe cyclone with cat 4 hurricane and so on..IMD FAQ page has info on Indian classification..http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/faq/FAQP.htm"
68,disha,12 Oct 2013 12:36 ,"^^ Agree. Just that sometimes you wonder when something lashes you at 220 kmph, will it lashing you at 218 kmph would have made less of a difference? I think for Indian conditions the ascending scale should be :1 - Chot lagne ki ashanka hain (you will get hurt)...4 - Marne ki ashanka hain ( most likely to die )5 - Pooch daba ke bhaag ( tuck your tail and run!!)"

CNN IBN reporting that the government has stated it cannot rescue them because of the weather condition. Odisha TV, on the other hand, tweeted that Coast Guard personnel are trying to rescue the stranded fishermen. [UPDATE] Odisha TV just tweeted that all the 18 fishermen have been rescued by the Coast Guard.Great job Coast Guard! ‏@debabrata2008 More than 1.5 lakh people evacuated in Ganjam. Another 20000 on their way to cyclone shelter houses. Phailin landfall at 5.30 pm.Almost 2 lakh 4 lakh people evacuated. I hope it results in zero casualties as aimed.

71,harbans,12 Oct 2013 13:30 ,Some fishermen ventured to sea despite advisories asking them not to. Now the CG will have to risk their men to try and save these folks. Some news channels there were locals right at the beach near ground zero saying they are having fun! There is a culture of safety that is sorely lacking and must be tackled.
72,Comer,12 Oct 2013 13:35 ,^^ True. When I was in Goa I saw the lifeguards shouting hoarse for more than 1/2 hour using bullhorns to evict people from swimming in dangerous waters. Some were found to be arguing with the lifeguards. Same people will turn around and complain that Govt is not caring. Lots of attitude change required.

It would move northwestwards and cross north Andhra Pradesh and Odisha coasts between Kalingapatnam and Paradip, close to Gopalpur (Odisha) by evening of today i.e. the 12 th October, 2013 as a very severe cyclonic storm with a maximum sustained wind speed of 210-220 kmph gusting to 240 kmph.Estimated track and intensity of the system are given in the Table below:Date/Time(IST) Position (Lat. 0 N/ Long. 0 E) Sustained maximum surface wind speed (kmph) Category12-10-2013/1130 18.1/85.7 210-220 gusting to 240 Very Severe Cyclonic Storm 12-10-2013/1730 18.9/84.9 210-220 gusting to 240 Very Severe Cyclonic Storm 12-10-2013/2330 19.4/84.5 170-180 gusting to 200 Very Severe Cyclonic Storm 13-10-2013/0530 20.5/84.1 80-90 gusting to 100 Severe Cyclonic Storm 13-10-2013/1130 21.0/83.8 50-60 gusting to 70 Deep Depression 13-10.2013/2330 22.0/83.4 40-50 gusting to 60 DepressionWarning for Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal(i) Rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy falls at a few places and isolated extremely heavy falls (≥ 25 cm) would occur over coastal Odisha during next 48 hrs and over interior Odisha from today afternoon for subsequent 48 hrs. Rainfall at most places with isolated heavy to very heavy falls would also occur over north coastal Andhra Pradesh during next 48 hrs. Isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall would occur over coastal areas of West Bengal commencing from afternoon of today i.e. the 12 th October.(ii) Gale wind: Gale winds speed reaching 80-90 kmph gusting to 100 kmph would prevail along and off Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh coasts during next 6 hours. It would increase in intensity thereafter with gale wind speed reaching 100-150 kmph from noon and 210-220 kmph gusting to 235 along and off coastal districts of north coastal Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha at the time of landfall. State of Sea along and off Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh coast is high and will become gradually phenomenal from forenoon of today. It will be rough to very rough along and off West Bengal coast during the above period.(iii) Storm Surge Guidance: Storm surge with height of 3.0 to 3.5 metre. above astronomical tide would inundate low lying areas of Ganjam, Khurda, Puri and Jagatsinghpur districts of Odisha and Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh during landfall.(iv) Damage expected over Odisha and adjoining north Andhra Pradesh: Extensive damage to kutcha houses. Some damage to old buildings. Large scale disruption of power and communication lines. Disruption of rail and road traffic due to extensive flooding. Potential threat from flying debris.Flooding of escape routes. Extensive damage to agricultural crops.(v) Action suggested: Fishermen are advised not to venture into sea along north Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal coast. Total suspension of fishing operations. Large scale evacuation of population from coastal areas. Total suspension of rail and road traffic in vulnerable areas . People in affected areas to remain indoors.Post landfall outlook : Even after landfall the system is likely to maintain the intensity of very severe cyclonic storm for 6 hours and gradually weaken into a cyclonic storm in subsequent 6 hours while moving northwestwards across interior Odisha. Under its influence rainfall at most places with heavy falls at a few places and extremely heavy falls at isolated places would occur over Odisha. Rainfall at many places with isolated heavy to very heavy falls would also occur over north coastal Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and south Jharkhand. Squally wind speed reaching 100-120 kmph would also prevail for 6 hours and 60-70 for subsequent 6 hours over Odisha during the same period.The next bulletin will be issued at 1730 hrs IST of today, the 12 th October, 2013."

But it is clear now that they have not despite all the warnings. 12 hours before the storm surge there are people strolling on the beach despite all the warnings.I think it is a function of memory and options.

86,Theo_Fidel,12 Oct 2013 17:15 ,India does not fly aircraft into the cyclone to get actual measurements. Something we really need to start doing IMHO. The lowest estimate from radar was 912mb.Storm surge is dependent on the power of the hurricane 16-24 hours before landfall. It does not change that much after that. So storm surge will be commensurate to a Cat 5. Right now top of wave action is estimated at 45 feet! These waves will be coming ashore on top of the storm surge.Its a bad sign that it is coming ashore int the dark. People will have no warning at all.

But people have been warned and  evacuation has , apparently, completed. Revenue and Disaster management Dept people along with NDRF and Army/Navy/Airport  are already on high alert.  But casualties would not be avoided altogether due to many other reasons, I hope it will be minimum. Property damages could be rebuilt. I have been through  Cat-4 cyclone. Wind howling and force is incredible. Only strong structure and storm shelters can help if one is in rural areas and coastal areas. One needs to stay indoor . Once eye is crossing , there will be eerie silence and then wind will pick up in opposite direction with highest ferocity and slowly reduce. That is the time when most structure collapse , i.e. when eye passes over and opposite winds start.After cyclone, I could only see solar street lights functioning for seven -eitght days before power could be restored. It will be hell of a task restoring power. I think affected areas in  Odisha would  not have  power for fortnight or a month. That is when I realised importance of Solar Street lights or temporary Emergency Solar Light packs to provide lights till power is restored. You can not run off battery or other sources for very long time. Solar will charge during the day when sky is clear after the storm. No not even NPP would be able to supply power when  transmission lines and local distribution lines , transformers  poles etc are out."
93,Singha,12 Oct 2013 19:21 ,there have been noises made of IMO getting a couple of C130J equipped like the NOAA type planes. noises only so far. we dont even have a network of doppler radars with reliable backhaul to monitor localized microcells in real time like every US TV channel gets a diet of 24x7.darker whispers say much of the IOR tsunami buoys installed in a hurry are now not operational due to lack of money to maintain and overhaul them. this while japan and US maintain a tip top network in the pacific for their own safety. the last thing we need is a tsunami in middle of a cyclone. I spoke to a entrepreneur who had taken 50 of his employees on a picnic to a small island off karnataka coast on tsunami day. highest point in that island is 10feet above the low tide mark when I visited. says nobody was killed but most lost their cellphones because the water rose suddenly by 2 feet from calf height to chest height!

100,saip,12 Oct 2013 20:05 ,After '77 Cyclone I read that most of the anemometers failed to record and gusting winds were estimated at over 180 mph!  Even though people were warned ahead of time they refused to evacuate and it resulted in thousands of avoidable deaths.  But when another storm hit the same area a couple of years later everyone followed the advice and evacuated.  People seem to forget how destructive these cyclones are after a few years and everything starts all over again.
101,chaanakya,12 Oct 2013 20:27 ,"If population is evacuated to shelter then loss of lives may not be much , certainly not as large as 1999 cyclone. That was due to unpreparedness. Most of the structures in villages are not in a position to withstand cyclone fury of cat-3 and above. Coastal areas are at the risk of inundation. Many deaths take place because of uprooting of trees, lightening strikes, electrical shock. Now shutting power is mandatory. Staying indoor is advisable. Moving to higher ground is safer. But never take shelter under a tree. Don't stay on roads. Loose Things fly aroundand may hit , injure and kill one. Drowning  near coastal areas are possible so move inland. RDM keeps food ready during such emergency so  reach nearby shelter one is assured of food.The problem is also that of pilfering burglary  theft from unoccupied houses. people leave their houses to avoid cyclones and return to find all valuables gone. During first week after the cyclone, most of the copper wires, electrical equipments batteries will be stolen.Two days after cyclone there is chance of disease so medicine and area sanitation materials need to be deployed.Kerosene and fuel materials and adequate food supply need to be stored alone with  blankets ( this is winter season and people may die of cold. Dry firewood comes in handy.Rehab will start after cleaning up operation is done in the week following.Central govt will promise all help and deliver little after cyclone has passed. Their emergency teams will always be there to help but not much support will come thereafter. At least Odisha may not expect , but then it is election year so Congis may do it."

That may take  10 to 12 hours. I am hearing good news about disaster management  preparedness by Odisha Govt. I hope AP is also prepared equally as they were in turmoil .
104,chaanakya,12 Oct 2013 21:30 ,"One of the biggest damage would be damage to Coconut trees. Crowns will get broken and trees will wither away. That will affect village livelihood later as lot of people are dependent on that. After 1999 cyclone I saw in AP and Odisha large tracts of Coconut trees standing forlornly withering away. Of course , cyclone fury had done its death  dance then and more than 10.000 had died.  This time preparedness is far superior  and Amirkhans underestimate our IMD and RDM.

109,saip,12 Oct 2013 21:53 ,It seems it is a slow moving storm (only 10 miles per hour) and thus likely to cause more damage.  It would be an hour before the eye passes and it will be eerily quiet inside the eye and the whole thing will start again (was in the eye of '77 cyclone).

It has asked all telecom companies to share infrastructure including towers and bandwidth to ensure continuity of services in the two states.The department has also asked operators to connect to two helpline call centers with the numbers 1948 for Orissa and 1949 for Andhra Pradesh, as well as send information about the helpline numbers to their users in affected areas, according to an order on the department's website.The operators will also transmit text-message advisories from state governments and federal government agencies, including the National Disaster Management Authority and the meteorological department, the notice said.The order will be in effect for the next 15 days, and operators must report on the implementation status everyday at 8 a.m. to federal telecom officials in the two states.There were about 90.55 million users in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh at the end of July, data from the telecom regulator showed. India had 874.88 million subscribers at that time.Good that the Govt is proactive. Fingers crossed with all the precautions the damages should be minimal."

One of the problems in 1999 if you remember is that the admin got less than 36 hours warning of a severe cyclone because the IMD does not graduate the scale. It goes straight from severe cyclonic to super cyclonic. Folks never got a sense that the cyclone was strengthening. Even this time following the IMD would have meant a less than 24 hour evacuation period. Just 24 hours ago they were claiming that Phailin was not a super cyclone.Per the IMD all the way from 118-221 kmph is a very severe cyclonic storm. Which babu comes up with this.  Finally 221 and above is super cyclonic.Just to give you some comparison, this range is Category 1,2,3&4 on the Dvorak scale. I think it should be clear why everyone follows the international scale.

I can understand his concern that local media are not using IMD's bulletins, but then IMD has to interact with them on a regular basis or make information easily available to the general public. 2) He claimed the IMD models for the local basin is best understood by IMD only. Not true since if you look at the amount of publications on Indian monsoons as an example in the literature, the reality is there are lot of experts outside of India.

I was very small but I still remember the corpses all across the route. We went to see if our relatives are alive or not. In that village except for about 600 or so. Those who clinged on to trees and few big homes survived.But moving 800,000 folks is a historic event and India should be proud of its achievement.

Besides, whatever one calls the storm by categorization it matters little to the public. But, it helps the administration in planning ahead. I am sure in the US they like to err on the side of caution if they have to when making evacuation plans, since it was already a massive storm and had to be taken seriously. As it was being described by the weather channels in the US, the eyewall was going through some reformation so further strengthening was possible when the initial forecasts came out 48 hrs ago. Yes, all models will improve closer to landfall. I believe IMD also had to raise their wind speed estimates as it got closer. Well IMD also uses the GFS model like the rest with some local ingredients thrown in.http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dyna ... s_mslp.htm"

There are no hurricanes in US and the only closest ""International"" system is Japaneese which is not widely known in International system.So coming back to the ""simplicity"" of the US system., it was only after Katrina, that its scale got modified. So go easy on the criticism of IMD on whether its scale is simpler or not. It is nobody's case that it cannot be made simpler and it is a learning process. Unless you are condescending from your arm chair.Now coming to media bimbos - they are bimbos because IMD's bulletins are available and sent via PTI all over the place. All it takes a reading and putting 2+2 together. And this has been in place since - 1984 - the system has evolved since INSAT. In fact the biggest success was when daily my grandmother was waiting for the INSAT picture to show up on the black and white TV so that she can speculate on crops and advice my uncle (and drive him crazy). So if a granny in a remote village gets it - what about this khata-peeta types journos? So yes IMD has to interact with journos, so also journos need to put in effort to be there - for example Rahul Kanwal was there and for that he gets my respects (grudgingly).And [I think] you are being extremely condescending when you are criticizing IMD for making a confident statement about understanding of their own basins. Others may have insights and as well very good understanding of Indian basin., at the end of the day though IMD has the best understanding of their own backyard. So please get down your high horse and see the advances we have made in 15 years., the last cyclone of 1999 - Orissa - then entire Government ran away (can you hazard who was in charge?) - should not the head of the government of Orissa be tried of Mass murder then? Or at least dereliction of duty? And look now - all eyes are on the scene and there is ample evidence overall the government of Orissa and IMD and the defences did a good job. Many kudos to them.And yes, India is the largest operator of earth observation satellite systems. If you do not believe that, go argue with ISRO."

Post landfall, there will be no large change in the intensity,” he said, adding that for another 12 to 24 hours, there will be moderate rains in large parts of east India.For a cyclone to fall under the Super Cyclone category, the wind speed should cross 220 kmph.Rathore, however, denied that Phailin is a super cyclone. “It cannot be called a Super Cyclone. To fall under that category, the cyclone should cross the wind speed of 220 kmph,” he said.The ‘eye’ or centre of the cyclone is estimated to be 15 kilometers in spread and its intensity will continue till Sunday morning, Met officials said.Rathore said that the areas likely to suffer maximum damage are the stretch between Kalingaptam and Paradip while adding that Gopalpur will be the epicentre. “The very severe cyclonic storm will after six hours turn into cyclonic storm and then deep depression,” he said.Darkness enveloped wide swathes of the coastal districts of Odisha, especially Ganjam, whose Gopalpur-on-sea was the entry point for the storm uprooting trees and electric poles.People were forced to remain indoors by the pounding rains and vehicular traffic came to a grinding halt.Heavy to very heavy rainfall were also widespread in the districts of Gajapati, Khurda, Puri, Jagatsinghpur, Nayagarh, Cuttack, Bhadrak and Kendrapara in coastal region besides state capital Bhubaneshwar.However, the extent of damage wreaked by the cyclone was not immediately available. Seven people were killed in Odisha in the heavy rains ahead of the storm.Nearly six lakh people were evacuated, including 4.50 lakh in Odisha and over one lakh in Andhra Pradesh. Army, IAF, Navy, CRPF and National Disaster Response Force were positioned in areas vulnerable to the cyclone.All trains between Howrah and Visakhapatnam have been suspended and power supply switched off along the Odisha coastline, and three coastal districts in Andhra Pradesh as a precautionary measure. Flights and trains from Odisha capital Bhubaneshwar have also been suspended.At least 10 flights of Air India, Indigo and Jet Airways scheduled to arrive or take off from the airport here remained cancelled, director of Biju Patnaik International Airport Sarad Kumar said.In Andhra Pradesh, 1,29,100 people from 294 villages in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts have been shifted to 115 relief camps. AP Chief Minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy late tonight reviewed the impact of the cyclone and directed the entire official machinery in the north coastal districts to remain on high alert through the night.A high alert has been sounded in Srikakulam district in particular as rivers like Vamsadhara, Nagavali and Bahuda could be in spate because of heavy rains.Most of the evacuated people have been sheltered in 500 specially-built cyclone camps in the two States. Each cyclone shelter can accommodate up to 1,500 people while their ground floors may be used as cattle shelters.The National Disaster Management Authority said it had deployed nearly 2,000 National Disaster Response Force personnel in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal.Five lakh tonnes of foodgrains has been kept ready for distribution to the people in the affected region.In West Bengal, disaster management, civil defence and rescue teams have been deputed in Digha, Shankarpur, Contai, Mandarmoni, Diamond Harbour and some areas of the Sundarban.The MET office predicted heavy to very heavy rains at at some places over East and West Midnapore, North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, Bankura, Burdwan and Purulia districts in the next 48-hours. Kolkata would experience light to medium rainfall.(With inputs from agencies) "

Warnings were issued also to the administrations of the districts of Ganjam, Gajapati, Nayagarh, Puri, Khurda, Cuttack, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Bhadrak and Balasore. The State government had instructed the administrations to evacuate people and stock relief materials. The Army's 120 Infantry Battalion had also been put on alert.Despite all these, the government had no idea of the enormity of the crisis on hand. The authorities were aware that a cyclone had struck Paradeep but did not immediately know that tidal waves, rising up to 12 metres, had submerged several areas in Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara districts. The storm lasted 34 hours.The earlier devastation caused to Ganjam district appeared negligible in comparison to the blow the ""super cyclone"" dealt. According to unofficial reports, at least 5,000 people have been killed in Paradeep alone. Whereas the Divisional Commissioner's office estimated the property loss in Ganjam at Rs.1,000 crores. Chief Minister Giridhar Gamang put the damage caused by the ""super cyclone"" at Rs.1,000,000 crores. In Ganjam, the cyclone and the rain that accompanied it paralysed the Gopalpur port, affected two million people in 18 blocks and damaged 1,500 villages. The ""super cyclone"" destroyed 25,000 houses in Gajapati, Khurda, Puri, Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Bhadrak and Balasore districts.GIRIDHAR GAMANG and Revenue Minister Jagannath Patnaik undertook an aerial survey of the affected areas. Patnaik, who personally oversaw the relief operations in some areas, told Frontline: ""Such large-scale devastation has never been witnessed before in the whole of India. The cyclone has affected over two crore people and destroyed 30 lakh kutcha houses, rendering millions of people homeless. Roofs made of asbestos, tin sheets and tiles have been blown off. All agricultural land has gone under water, and saline water has entered the fields in many areas. In the marine belt, the prawn and fishing industry has collapsed.""Gamang told Frontline: ""The loss of cattle has been enormous. I saw the devastation from the helicopter."" The State government on November 5, submitted a report to the Centre seeking a preliminary assistance of Rs.2,500 crores for rebuilding the socio-economic and administrative infrastructure. The total cost of this is projected at Rs.10,000 crores.TENS of thousands of people camped on highways (two National Highways had breached, affecting road traffic) and rail bridges. Railway tracks in several places had been uprooted or washed away. Uprooted trees blocked all land approaches to the affected areas. Road links to Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Jajpur and Bhadrak districts were cut off. Only wireless communication was possible to Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur. Jagatsinghpur suffered extensive damage as sea water overwhelmed vast areas. The spectre of epidemics loomed over the district, as five lakh people lived in the marooned villages amidst decomposed bodies and carcasses.SUSHANTO PATRONOBISH Paradeep port, which bore the brunt of the cyclone that slammed the coast on October 29 with a wind velocity of 260 to 300 km per hour.In Paradeep, villagers and also Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) jawans posted in Paradeep Phosphate Ltd claimed that the human toll in the region would be not less than 8,000. (Unofficial reports have put the toll in Paradeep at 15,000. The official figure, however, stands at 1,381.)Several tugs and trawlers sank off the Paradeep port. Tiny villages along the coast have been turned into lakes, blotting out all signs of human inhabitation. The entire Paradeep region was under water. Debris of houses were found floating in the water. Bodies were found trapped under the debris. As the waters began to recede, the stench of putrefied bodies and carcasses pervaded the air. The Paradeep creek reeked with bloated bodies. Earthmovers and dumpers scooped them up, while Port Trust workers cremated them. The survivors, meanwhile, looked around frantically for food.The PPL itself is facing a crisis. R.C. Mota, Plant Manager, told Frontline that at least Rs.100 crores would be required to cover the cost of damage caused to property and machinery. Power supply to the affected areas was disconnected. R.K. Das, PPL's Regional Director, said: ""The Air Force provided two generators that served only 10 per cent of the premises. We need an 11-kv generator of 1.2 to 2 MW capacity to control the pressure in the ammonia tank in normal conditions. In view of the atmospheric condition, we release small amounts of ammonia into the air.""Das said that the situation at PPL was grim. ""Our hospital is filled with outsiders who have sought shelter. I am fighting an epidemic here. As it is we have to feed 2,700 people (PPL workers and their families) and on top of that 5,000 outsiders have entered the premises. They snatch whatever food is brought for us. If food is brought via road, villagers rob the vehicles.""C.V. SUBRAHMANYAM Railway tracks twisted out of shape by the impact of the cyclone and the torrential rain that accompanied it. Many passengers were stranded after rail links were cut off.Along the 150-km stretch between Paradeep and Bhubaneswar, hundreds of people waited for an occasional vehicle coming that way with food. Uprooted trees and electricity and telegraph poles lined the entire stretch.The silver city of Cuttack, which was under knee-deep water, suffered because of its basin-like topography. The city could not discharge the run-off rain water as the two rivers that flanked it had reached the danger level. It was plunged into darkness, with the electricity supply disrupted. Large areas of Cuttack district remained inaccessible even seven days after the storm crossed the coast, with blocks such as Niali-Kantapara, Govindpur, Baranga, Banki, Yigiria, Athgarh, Mahanga, Salepur and Nischintkoli still flooded. The toll in the district is expected to be around 300. An epidemic broke out in Govindpur.Cuttack was luckier than Kendrapara district. From 500 metres above ground level, it appeared like a cluster of islands. What were land routes until October 29 are now navigated by boats. Hungry people scampered on sighting an Air Force chopper, hoping to receive some relief.The picture was no better in the Chandheli region in Bhadrak district: access to the survivors was only by boats. With their rooftops torn off, the victims lived amidst floating carcasses, exposed to disease. While food was air-dropped, drinking water was unavailable.C.V. SUBRAHMANYAM An aerial view of a village which was destroyed completely near Berhampur.The situation in Balasore, Bhadrak, Jajpur, Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur districts worsened as a result of flash floods in the Baitarani, the Brahmani, the Subernarekha and several other rivers. In Bhadrak district, the Kansa Bansa and Salandi rivers washed away more than 50 villages. Bijayshree Routray, who represents Basudevpur in the State Assembly, told Frontline: ""Thousands of people and over 30,000 head of cattle have been killed.""Balasore district was cut off owing to the breaching of National Highway Number 5 and the railway line. However, the missile launching pad at Chandipore-on-sea was not affected.More than 2.5 lakh families in Jagatsinghpur district were rendered homeless and 1.5 lakh head of cattle affected. With relief not reaching all parts of the district, it is reported that the starving people are eating cattle fodder. In Erasma, at least 30 people are reported to have died of starvation. In Jajpur district, 15.5 lakh families were affected. In Puri, the number of deaths was officially estimated at 151. More than 5,000 tourists were reported to be stranded in the district.In Keonjhar district, 40 villages were marooned. More than 10,000 people sought shelter in relief camps. Bridges over the Singhei and Kusei rivers in the district collapsed. The State highway between Keonjhar and Cuttack was cut off, with the Kusei changing course near Anandpur.A body being loaded on to a dumper near Paradeep.Bhubaneswar, considered one of the greenest cities in the country, was a shambles. It appeared the city was in the middle of a war zone - trees were uprooted, buildings damaged, lamp posts broken, houses smashed, hoardings torn off, fences broken, cars wrecked and parks destroyed.Seven days after the cyclone hit the State, rail communication had not been restored completely and inundated roads not cleared for traffic. Indeed, Orissa appears to have a long haul ahead.BTW do people here know Giridhar Gamang? I hope so!"

177,disha,13 Oct 2013 07:40 ,"5 Years after Orissa Super-Cyclone of 1999http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2123/stories/20041119002204600.htmTHE STATESThe agony of the livingPRAFULLA DASin ErsamaUnable to come to terms with the loss of relatives and property, many survivors of the super-cyclone that hit Orissa in 1999 continue to suffer from psychological trauma and suicidal impulses.PRAFULLA DAS  The family of Laxmi Mandal of Ajgarbedi village, who has been traumatised by the loss of her parents and a life of misery after the 1999 cyclone.IT is five years since a super-cyclone ripped apart coastal Orissa. But no sign of the catastrophic impact of that event is externally visible in Ersama block in Jagatsinghpur district, which now presents a picture of tranquillity and beauty. Lush green paddy fields, prawn culture ponds, patches of casuarina plantations and hamlets add to the lovely setting. But beneath it all, thousands of cyclone survivors are living lives of penury, uncertainty and psychological distress.With the authorities focussing only on brick and mortar construction, psychosocial rehabilitation of the survivors has taken a back seat. The result is that as many as 59 people have committed suicide during the past five years in Ersama block alone. The victims belong to the 14-35 age group, and were mostly women and girls. The disturbing fact came to light when the Bangalore-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) and Sneha Abhiyan, an initiative of ActionAid, conducted recently a survey for the Orissa State Disaster Mitigation Authority (OSDMA) on the mental health problems in Ersama.Ersama was the ground zero of the super-cyclone that hit the State on October 29, 1999, washing away lakhs of houses and leaving thousands of people dead in as many as 12 coastal districts (Frontline, November 26, 1999). Of the 9,000-odd lives that were lost, Ersama block accounted for more than 8,000.In fact, the number of cyclone survivors who committed suicide could be higher. The NIMHANS-ActionAid survey covered only 11 of the total 25 gram panchayats in Ersama block - precisely, 15,004 respondents from 2,615 households in 72 villages of the block - and hence there were no data available on the mental health of the survivors in the remaining 14 gram panchayats.ASHOKE CHAKRABARTY  A malnourished boy in Garaharishpur village in Ersama block, Jagatsinghpur district, Orissa.The survey showed that a staggering 11 per cent of the respondents expressed the wish to die. Those who committed suicide were primarily victims of post-traumatic stress disorders such as restlessness, flashbacks and sleep disturbances. Some others ended their lives because they were plagued by the guilt that they survived when their loved ones were washed away by the huge sea waves that accompanied the storm.The study found that of the total respondents, 2,048 were mentally ill. The impact of the disaster was significantly higher among widows, illiterates and those who suffered multiple losses such as the loss of kin, livelihood, property and livestock.""It is not only the disaster that triggered the suicides, but the subsequent life events,"" said Dr. K. Sekar, a psychiatrist working with NIMHANS. The suicide rate in Ersama was four times that in a normal community, he said.According to Dr. Sekar, rehabilitation and reconstruction alone will not help. The psychosocial problems facing the cyclone survivors have to be addressed with equal zeal. Mental health camps could be organised jointly by NIMHANS and ActionAid at different places in Ersama if the State government provided necessary support and arranged to send a team of psychiatrists from the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack, he suggested.PRAFULLA DAS  Saraswati Mandal of Khuranta village with her daughter Lipika. A cyclone widow, she has said no to remarriage and is bringing up her daughter alone.THE tales of sorrow in Ersama have varied shades. In Noliasahi hamlet in Gadakujang gram panchayat, 57-year-old Bhabi Behera attempted suicide twice by hanging herself from a tree but her neighbours saved her both times. She was not able to cope with the loss of her house and belongings in the cyclone. A voluntary organisation is now helping her to recover from stress.But no one was able to save 42-year-old cyclone widow Sandhya and her 16-year-old daughter Kuni in Sarabapata village. Sandhya had lost her husband and two daughters in the cyclone. She and Kuni failed to cope with the losses and were depressed despite being allotted a dwelling unit by a voluntary organisation. Kuni hanged herself to death last year after a quarrel with her mother, and Sandhya ended her life a few months ago by setting herself on fire.The loss of her parents and a life full of misery were the possible factors that turned Laxmi Mandal of Ajgarbedi village mentally ill a few months ago. Laxmi once tried to bury one of her children near her hut, but the child was saved by her neighbour Sukanta Sahu. The mother of four is now undergoing treatment at the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack.Laxmi's family is landless and has no source of income. Her husband Manoranjan Mandal is not able to go to work because he has to take care of the children and also see that Laxmi does not cause any harm to herself or the children. Of the four children, three were born after the cyclone.The family has not been allotted a house under the Indira Awas Yojna (IAY) because it does not possess a below poverty line (BPL) card. With no food at home, the family approached the local sarpanch for help but in vain. {So isn't the state pushing one family into penury just because they do not have the ""right"" card?}Life has been the hardest for women who lost their husbands to the cyclone. Many young widows remarried after the cyclone as they were beseeched by suitors lured by the compensation they received in lieu of the death of their near and dear. Each death fetched Rs.75,000. But many of the men who married the women blew the money, and deserted them.Some young widows, however, seem to have learnt from the mistakes of others. Saraswati Mandal of Khuranta village spurned all offers of remarriage and instead decided to parent Lipika, her eight-year-old daughter, alone. ""I will not marry to suffer like other widows,"" she said. Renubala Mandal, another cyclone widow, is bringing up her two daughters single-handedly.Many families that survived the cyclone remain homeless. The State government had obtained the Centre's approval for the construction of eight lakh IAY houses after the super-cyclone. However, the administration has not been able to cover the homeless families even in Ersama.""There have been serious irregularities in the allotment of IAY houses. While a large number of poor families have not been allotted houses under the scheme for want of BPL cards, many affluent families have got these houses by managing to secure such cards,"" said members of Jana Kalyan Parishad, a voluntary organisation run by a group of cyclone survivors in Kunjakothi gram panchayat. The State government has ordered an inquiry into several such cases of irregularity.Lack of supervision by the authorities has resulted in the non-completion of thousands of IAY houses in Ersama block. Many families have spent the money allotted for the house construction for purposes such as a daughter's marriage or buying bullocks. As a result, almost every village in Ersama has half-built IAY houses. {Should not the government also provide a separate loan for buying bullocks? Livelihood. And a soft loan for daughter's marriage if necessary}Trying to earn a livelihood by fishing. Thousands of cyclone survivors are leading lives of penury and psychological distress.The less said about the public distribution system (PDS) in Ersama the better. The only commodity available at the PDS outlets here is kerosene. The quantity of rations also varies from village to village. The authorities have also failed to bring all the vulnerable villages under the Integrated Child Development Scheme. {some do try to commit suicide by drinking kerosene!!}While many multi-purpose cyclone shelters have been constructed close to the block headquarters, such shelters are not visible in several vulnerable pockets. Lack of proper roads have made the transporting of building materials to far-flung villages a problem. Electricity connection is yet to be restored in 30-odd villages in Ersama block. {Blow to modi, 5 years hence! - had to say that}The authorities have done little to help the survivors overcome the psychological trauma and rebuild their lives. Hundreds of voluntary organisations had flocked to Ersama after the disaster, but only a few continued working in the block.So the next step for us jingoes is to hope for the best, prepare for the worst and slowly open up purse strings for long term rehabilitation. That is when the most interest of donors wane! Since it is tough."

Ardent devotees are holed up in houses, anxiously watching news channels about the progress of the dreaded, very severe cyclonic storm Phailin (Thai for sapphire). Since noon on Saturday, incessant rains followed by gusts of howling winds have heralded the imminent arrival of Phailin as it tears through the Bay of Bengal, churning the bay in a cataclysmic whirlwind packing the force of several nuclear bombs.The approaching nemesisThe monsoon in 2013 has been unusual in Odisha. Spells of dry weather have been punctuated by heavy rains caused by low-strength depressions. A hot and humid climate had made life uncomfortable, which was surprising as the land mass usually cooled off in July after heavy monsoon showers.Phailin is already categorized as Category 4 storm with wind speeds of 240km per hour, a notch below the 1999 disaster. The 1999 super cyclone was Category 5 as it had wind speed in excess of 250km/hour. A tidal surge of 10-12ft is also expected. By 6-8pm on Saturday evening, Phailin will strike near Gopalpur, the salubrious seaside holiday spot in Ganjam district.Bay cyclones and devastationThe Bay of Bengal is no stranger to cyclones as its peculiar topography acts like a funnel for cyclones. As they form and move towards the coast, they gather strength being squeezed between the land mass comprising the Indian coast on the west side with Bangladesh to the north and Myanmar to the east. Due to the constricted path, the winds get stronger and stronger as their forces play out on progressively lesser ocean surface before landfall.Out of the 35 deadliest tropical cyclones of the world, the Bay of Bengal has recorded 26, which is disproportionately high. Tropical cyclones can cause tremendous loss of human lives and property. The Great Boha Cyclone of November 1970 led to the loss of an estimated 300,000-500,000 lives in Bangladesh. This was followed by the 1971 cyclone on the Odisha coast leading to the loss of more than 9,000 lives. The Odisha super cyclone of 1999 led to the loss of more than 9,500 human lives apart from countless cattle deaths and the loss of nearly 90 million trees. There was an estimated damage of $2.5 billion (at 1999 prices).Horrifying memories of the 1999 super cyclone are still vividly etched in people’s minds. An ill-prepared administration could do little to save lives. No evacuations took place and regular bulletins were absent. Neither were there cyclone shelters or pucca buildings in the coastal villages for shelter. A massive relief and reconstruction undertaking that lasted for several years was carried out. It took millions in aid money to restore normalcy and rebuild houses and public infrastructure such as power stations, poles, roads, bridges, schools and hospitals that had been battered flat. Fortunately, we are in a vastly different position compared with the woeful state of preparedness in 1999, given the fact that nearly 500 cyclone shelters and hundreds of thousands of pucca private buildings have come up in coastal villages.The changing monsoon pattern is a sure indicator of climate change caused by increased emission of greenhouse gases due to the high dependency upon fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum. It is also unfortunate that governments across the world, including the Indian government, are refusing to act though.Gaps in cyclone mitigationIt is true that governments can do little to stop a cyclone, but they can definitely prepare to mitigate their impact. The Odisha State Disaster Mitigation Authority (OSDMA), which was set up in 2000, has been a blundering and incompetent monolith. No visible preparatory measures have been taken. No tidal surge modelling studies were conducted to assess the extent of inundation given a particular wind speed and storm surge values, which could have generated vital information for the local administration.Right now, a clueless government is carrying out evacuation en masse all over the coast in the four districts of Ganjam, Khurda, Puri and Jagatsinghpur. This means displacement, providing shelter, and feeding of nearly half a million people, an enormous task. Besides, there has been no preparations for emergency feeding of livestock for which fodder is required.No effort had been made to link up with youth clubs, the National Cadet Corps (NCC) and the National Service Scheme (NSS) in colleges so that a readymade, well-trained volunteer army of several thousand are available for rescue and relief work. The first state-level non-governmental organization coordination meeting took place on 10 October, just two days before the strike date.Destroying natural coastal protection measuresThe natural barriers that were present on the Odisha coast such as mangroves and huge sand dunes have been mostly destroyed. Illegal shrimp farms have replaced mangroves in most coastal districts such as Puri, Kendrapada and Jagatsinghpur. Huge sand dunes more than 80ft in height that could quell tidal surges and tsunamis, and break high-speed winds were common in the early 1970s on the Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur and Puri coasts. These sand dunes were flattened, thanks to beach plantations of casuarina trees after the 1971 cyclone. These soft-wood trees snapped like matchsticks during the 1999 cyclone, yet the mistake was repeated with the forest department spending crores of rupees on such plantations, including the turtle nesting areas on the Devi river and Rushikulya river mouth.The ill-planned development of 12 new ports is going to be another disaster for the Odisha coast as they are going to disrupt the coastal processes leading to avoidable erosion in many beaches. Hundreds of thousands of trees were felled for the Posco steel plant near Dhinkia and Gobindpur coast, thereby paving the way for high-speed winds to blow away the fragile houses of residents. This mega steel project could have been located far inland in barren land such as Kalinganagar had the government appreciated the need to protect such near-coast tree cover.Biswajit Mohanty is an environmentalist based in Cuttack, Orissa and a former member of the National Board for Wildlife."

In AP which regularly gets hit by cyclone the administration is having more exposure and systems and procedures are in place. But 1999 Odissa is bad in administration and not much exposure and this resulted in a major tragedy. But we hope the administration is better now. Deaths will be reporTed soon and hope media acts responsibly. In respect of India's Katarina Samurai Gupta is Indian Nepolian and Neapolitan is not Samudra Gupta of France.

He is addressing concerns of aam junta in a largely scientifically illiterate country. So he has to give answers more directly to the media, rather than poke fun at them for their ignorance. This is not a science class, but affects people's life and property. Though overall IMD did a better job this time around, but a few noticeable things were like how dismissive he was of international sources being quoted by the Indian media. The reason the media quotes the International agencies, is because they have made it easy for people to follow with regular updates and explanation.  1) He sounded kind of dismissive when someone in the media asked whether it was a Cat-5 storm, almost like he did not understand the question. I can understand his concern that local media are not using IMD's bulletins, but then IMD has to interact with them on a regular basis or make information easily available to the general public. 2) He claimed the IMD models for the local basin is best understood by IMD only. Not true since if you look at the amount of publications on Indian monsoons as an example in the literature, the reality is there are lot of experts outside of India. Besides, IMD folks have sent people out to learn more on the European and US modeling community's efforts to incorporate in theirs. Most of the storm tracking improvements on exact landfall have come from such interactions. He is way off the mark on that from what I have heard.Bade, ""International"" here means US. There are no hurricanes in US and the only closest ""International"" system is Japaneese which is not widely known in International system.So coming back to the ""simplicity"" of the US system., it was only after Katrina, that its scale got modified. So go easy on the criticism of IMD on whether its scale is simpler or not. It is nobody's case that it cannot be made simpler and it is a learning process. Unless you are condescending from your arm chair.Now coming to media bimbos - they are bimbos because IMD's bulletins are available and sent via PTI all over the place. All it takes a reading and putting 2+2 together. And this has been in place since - 1984 - the system has evolved since INSAT. In fact the biggest success was when daily my grandmother was waiting for the INSAT picture to show up on the black and white TV so that she can speculate on crops and advice my uncle (and drive him crazy). So if a granny in a remote village gets it - what about this khata-peeta types journos? So yes IMD has to interact with journos, so also journos need to put in effort to be there - for example Rahul Kanwal was there and for that he gets my respects (grudgingly).And [I think] you are being extremely condescending when you are criticizing IMD for making a confident statement about understanding of their own basins. Others may have insights and as well very good understanding of Indian basin., at the end of the day though IMD has the best understanding of their own backyard. So please get down your high horse and see the advances we have made in 15 years., the last cyclone of 1999 - Orissa - then entire Government ran away (can you hazard who was in charge?) - should not the head of the government of Orissa be tried of Mass murder then? Or at least dereliction of duty? And look now - all eyes are on the scene and there is ample evidence overall the government of Orissa and IMD and the defences did a good job. Many kudos to them.And yes, India is the largest operator of earth observation satellite systems. If you do not believe that, go argue with ISRO.I agree with your views and facts stated."

They don't have access to real time data especially non satellite sourced and even in case of massa SATs their polar ones dont have continuous coverage over India and probably zero geostationery ones over Indian basin equivalent to INSAT series which Isro operates and IMD has realtime access to.So yes Indian journos should give precedence to IMD predictions first and foremost .

All the hardwork of dedicated desis past and present gives us a moment of satisfaction in this major event.Cyclone Phailin: How India evaded a major casualtyINDIA TODAY ONLINE  NEW DELHI, OCTOBER 13, 2013 | UPDATED 11:03 ISTAs gusty winds of over 200 kilometers an hour and a very heavy downpour marked the onslaught of Cyclone Phailin on Saturday, India's preparedness to face one of the major disasters of the recent times seems to have evaded a major casualty.In one of the biggest evacuation programme in Indian history, over 5.5 lakh people were evacuated from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh to safer places.The massive evacuation programme was put in place two days ahead of the Cyclone Phailin hitting the Indian coasts largely because of the advance warning issued by the Indian Meteorological Department. Learning lessons from the recent Uttarakhand floods, the Indian authorities pressed all their might to ensure the safety of people living in the coastal belt of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. About 4,50,000 people were evacuated from Odisha and one lakh from three districts of Andhra. An alert was also issued for those who were not ready to move out.The government pressed into action some 18 helicopters and 12 aircrafts which were put on stand by to tackle any emergency situation.The administration, police, NDRF and the defence forces were made fully prepared to combat any challenge. The Government also identified some 600 buildings as cyclone shelters, and people were evacuated from areas near the coast, including Ganjam, Puri, Khordha and Jagatsinghapur Districts in Odisha.The Centre put all disaster preparedness measures in place so that the impact of the natural disaster is minimized, and urged the people living along the coast to exercise prudence.In the process, the NDRF deployed a number of teams both in Odisha and in Andhra Pradesh. In Odisha, 26 NDRF teams along with three on standby were deployed. In Andhra Pradesh, there were 15 teams of NDRF, with additional two on standby.There were an additional 30 to 25 teams, which could be deployed at short notice. Control rooms were set up within every Ministry, which would work around the clock. The Army deployed an engineering task force, six composite relief units, four columns in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The Air Force, on its part, put in place frontline C-17 Globemasters, C-130 J Super Hercules and IL-76 transport planes to Odisha to carry out relief operations.The Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy assumed the highest degree of readiness to render all necessary humanitarian assistance.Two Indian Naval ships, including the Landing Platform Dock INS Jalashwa were standing by to proceed with dispatch to the most affected areas of Odisha in the cyclone's aftermath.INS Jalashwa, the second largest combatant of the Indian Navy, is ideally equipped to undertake Humanitarian Aid Distress Relief (HADR), evacuation, logistic support and hospital ship operations.Both the ships were poised with additional divers, doctors, inflatable rubber boats, integral helicopters and relief material that include food, tentage, clothes, medicines, blankets etc, in quantities sufficient to sustain over 5000 personnel for three days.Six advance diving teams with inflatable boats, rescue material and satellite communication left for Odisha by road to operate from INS Chilka, 50 km north of Gopalapatnam, where the cyclone was expected to make landfall.These personnel were assisted by four platoons from the local naval station and doctors from INHS Nivarini in their rescue and relief efforts.The Eastern Naval Command was monitoring the developments closely and was in constant communication with the state administration to augment rescue and relief operations.Six helicopters were standing by at the Naval Air Station INS Dega to undertake reconnaissance, rescue, casualty evacuation and air drop of relief material to the stranded.Additionally, the telecom department also prepared itself to ensure that communication links are stable during the expected disaster.The Indian Railways cancelled 99 trains and also short terminated and diverted a number of trains in view of the sever Cyclone Phailin to evade any casualty.Read more at: http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cycl ... 14401.html"

199,Comer,13 Oct 2013 14:48 ,"^^ True. There was a bunch of Western experts who were consistently saying IMD got it wrong on the conservative side and runs the risk of downplaying severity. I too shamefully fell for it. Now IMD got the most accurate prediction of them all. Only nitpick is that they should also be good at disseminating information along with their excellent job of prediction/modelling. One could argue that they might have given out information to those to matter the most, the people who are affected, rather than a guy sitting safely miles away. But these things help peripherally.I also must admit the TV media though sometimes said inane things, waited for official updates from IMD/NDMA before putting out information. The fault lies in the update frequency of official orgs rather than media. If they jump the gun, the same people will turn around and accuse them of not waiting till experts confirmed it."
200,Sagar G,13 Oct 2013 15:34 ,"Regarding the recent success w.r.t. Phailin our very own SDRE weather prediction model VARSHA might have played a significant role in this.From NAL's site for VarshaQ. What is the Varsha GCM?A. The Varsha General Circulation Model, is a weather prediction code developed at NAL as part of the ongoing NMITLI project.It evolved from the GCM code of NCMRWF, Noida which in turn was based on the NCEP spectral code.The Varsha GCM solves the governing equations of the atmosphere around the globe. The spectral method is used for better accuracy. A significant feature of the Varsha GCM is the boundary layer module with ""heat-flux"" scaling, which is more appropriate for the low winds which are generally present over India.Q. What inputs do you need for the weather prediction model?A. Global fields of temperature, winds,humidity and pressure over a three-dimensional grid (latitude, longitude, altitude) are required as initial conditions to the model.Q. Where do you get the input data?A. We use the assimilated initial conditions available in the public domain from NCEP, USA. These datasets are prepared using observations from all over the globe (shared by countries under a WMO agreement) and a variety of sources (ground stations, satellite data, radio-sondes, aircraft and ship reports..).Q. What are the quantities you predict?A.Our focus is on monsoon rainfall, usually on an all India scale.We also forecast tracks of tropical cyclones.Q. Do you predict tsunamis?A. NO, the Varsha GCM is an atmospheric model, while tsunamis are essentially oceans waves triggered by earthquakes.From NAL's 2010-11 annual report pg.6In the other NMITLI programme under the societal mission involving development of the Met code, VARSHA, with finer grid and ten Tera FLOP HPC system, the inter-process communication system comprising of reconfigurable FPGA-based FloSwitch and PCI cards were fully integrated with a 256- processor system which is part of the ten Tera FLOPS machine; the endurance test was also completed successfully. The resolution of Varsha GCM was enhanced to 40/20 KM and successfully ported to the 256- processor system. Monsoon onset for 2010 was captured well by the Varsha GCM. The summer and monsoon 2010 forecasts of Varsha GCM were regularly communicated to the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the Prime Minister’s Office, the Agriculture Ministry and IMD. This data is being used for crop planning and drought mitigation.Also found a research article from current science dated 25th sept. 2010 titled Forecast of the Track and intensity of tropical cyclone AILA over the Bay of Bengal by the Global Spectral Atmospheric model VARSHA"
201,Bade,13 Oct 2013 17:28 ,"Jingos here need to realize the origins of the Spectral model (http://coaps.fsu.edu/prediction/G-RSM/) and HRWF (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Weather_Research_and_Forecasting_model) which IMD is using for these forecasts. Not to mention as admitted per IMD itself that the initial conditions data are sourced from everywhere in the global community. WMO exists for that purpose largely.Check this document. http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dyna ... verage.pdfEspecially pages 4, 11, 14. The key difference is not the underlying physics of the models, but one of the things already mentioned earlier in one of the articles that IMD now runs the regional model every 30 minutes due to improved computing facilities, which will help. IMD does not have to do global assimilation of data as they are concerned only for the local basin, reducing computing demands significantly. This is a welcome progress and kudos should be shared with C-DAC and CMMACS which I believe from previous reports have been involved in this area."

208,harbans,13 Oct 2013 19:26 ,"Bade Ji, you have a point. While IMD has considerably improved in the last few years, it's public data coverage for Indian Ocean region remains woeful. Even those ships that transit IOR region don't go much by IMD broadcasts..they prefer Japanese and US sources and routing advice. The contention is not about whether the US data was right or IMD got it right on windspeed. The truth is certainly in between. The US was on the higher side and the IMD 200 kmph on the lower, from some accounts of those who witnessed both. From Rahul Kanwals tweets, the landfall (eye passing) occurred an hour and half post IMD declaration whence the fury knocked of all his equipment and shattered the windows of his accommodation. Large credit for lesser casualities does go to the adminstration.,and preparations, convincing people to evacuate etc."

Hopefully the Aadhaar card linkage comes through for the civil admin.Then the need for prefab structures resistant to such wind speeds, railways already use concrete reinforced sleepers, those contractors could be encouraged to diversify by the IAS wallahs to build simple prefab homes in place of mud or thatched houses.Also, when main power is lost Cell towers would need to revert to support HAM radio networks as a backup which probably can be supported by solar panels used for street lighting purposes."
211,Bade,13 Oct 2013 19:56 ,"harbans, IMD gave a wide window just like they do here too in the US. Yes, there is always some uncertainty in all forecasts. It is a fact of life. The GFS runs at least in the US are run every 6 hours globally, of course regional forecast models can have their own run frequency. But the need to run frequently your models, is necessary if your data collection frequency is better. Nowadays with all the buoys as seen in the IOR region (not just from IMD) but other national agencies too helps in improving the forecasts. All the evacuation efforts really helped and the fact that landfall was during low tide as per reports. It meant storm surge was not as damaging too. Good news is always welcome. Hopefully, lessons learned will be made into SOP for future calamities, which will certainly come with climate change as IPCC reports that came out recently mention."

Let state Admin not sit on its well deserved laurels but work hard to rebuilt  lives.GOPALPUR/SRIKAKULAM: Cyclone Phailin on Sunday left a trail of destruction knocking down lakhs of homes affecting nearly 90 lakh people and destroying paddy crops worth about Rs 2,400 crore, but Odisha and Andhra Pradesh escaped from widespread loss of life.As the largest evacuation efforts in the country's recent history helped keep casualties to the minimum, reports from the two states tonight said that 23 people died, all but two of them in Odisha. Most of the casualties were caused by wall collapse, uprooted trees and in floods.Communication links were vastly disrupted by the strong winds that went upto a speed of 220 kmph when the ""very severe"" cyclonic storm crossed the coast near Gopalpur last night and weakened before turning into a depression. Ganjam district in Odisha bore the brunt of the storm.According to IMD tonight, Phailin weakened further turning into ""deep depression"" with wind speed of 45-55 kmph and currently lay over northern Chhattisgarh, parts of Orissa and Jharkhand. According to M Mohapatra, scientist (Cyclone Warning Division) of the meteorology department, the ""cyclonic storm"" has now turned to ""deep depression"" with the wind speed of 45-55 kmph. It currently lays over northern Chhattisgarh, parts of Orissa and Jharkhand. It is expected to weaken further late tonight, he said. Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the primary aim was to minimize loss of human lives and they have successfully managed to do so. ""Property to the tune of several crores has been damaged...Rehabilitation will now be done.""Giving details of the devastation, Odisha revenue minister S N Patro said 14,514 villages in 12 districts have been affected, hitting a population of 80,53,620.Over 2.34 lakh houses have been damaged and more than 8.73 lakh people evacuated.Over five lakh hectares of standing crops have been destroyed by the gushing waters causing an estimated loss of Rs 2,400 crore, he said."

217,Suraj,13 Oct 2013 23:10 ,"The wunderground blog folks were talking about a 3m storm surge as far north as the Bangladesh coast, and criticized the IMD's estimates. Ultimately the latter proved more accurate in hindsight. Here's his latest blog entry:Powerful Cyclone Phailin not a Mega-Disaster for IndiaA victory for India's cyclone evacuation and preparation effortsWhile we have yet to hear from the worst affected area, the town of Gopalpur in Odisha where the eye of Phailin came ashore, it is clear that India has avoided a humanitarian mega-disaster like occurred in October 1999, when the great 1999 Odisha Cyclone killed nearly 10,000 people in the same region of the county. The India Meteorology Department (IMD) provided excellent early warning information for Phailin, predicting on October 9 that the cyclone would strike on October 12 with at least Category 2-strength winds. Civil defense in India took the warnings seriously, and operated the largest evacuation effort in the nation's history--nearly 1 million people--one that undoubtedly saved hundreds of lives. There were far more shelters available to put the evacuees in, compared to in 1999, thanks to a major effort to build more shelters after the cyclone. The high death toll in the 1999 cyclone was blamed, in part, due to lack of shelters.How strong was Phailin?According to satellite strength estimates made by the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), Phailin was just as strong as the great 1999 Odisha Cyclone, 12 hours before landfall. Both storms were rated as Category 5 storms with winds of 160 mph. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) strength estimates for Phailin were considerably lower than that of JTWC, but since both centers use satellite estimates rather than direct measurements of the winds and pressure, we don't know which center was correct. It is true that satellite estimates using the same techniques give different central pressures for the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans--i.e., a storm with the same appearance on satellite imagery will have a higher pressure in the Atlantic than in the Pacific (see this chart of the differences.) However, the satellite estimates give the same winds for each ocean, since the lower pressures in the Pacific are due to the fact that background pressures in the Pacific are lower, and it takes a much lower central pressure to generate the same winds as in an Atlantic storm. It may be the satellite-wind relationship is different in the Indian Ocean, though. IMD has looked at some buoy data to try and calibrate their satellite strength estimates, but high-end tropical cyclones are uncommon enough in the Indian Ocean that I doubt we really know whether or not Indian Ocean cyclones have the same winds as a hurricane in the Atlantic with the same satellite signature. Another thing to consider is that the IMD uses 3-minute average winds for their advisories, and JTWC uses 1-minute, so the winds in the IMD advisories will be lower by at least 2%, due to the longer averaging period. (I said incorrectly that IMD uses 10-minute averaging times in my Saturday blog post.) We need a hurricane hunter aircraft in the Indian Ocean to fly into tropical cyclones and take measurements of the actual winds to resolve the issue.Good to see the comments for the article too stating regret at the over-eager trashing of IMD's capabilities."

Although the cyclone has abated from the region, the AAD College, one of Indian Army's premiere training establishment, had geared up to not just safeguard its own assets but also the lives of the civilians living around their camp.Anticipating much of the fury of the impending cyclone, the Indian Army had also mobilised one engineering column with medical and signal equipment and personnel to tackle any emergency. Earlier in the day, the column helped clear the National Highway and other roads enabling communication to be restored at the earliest.Apart from establishing a movement liaison cell at Bhubaneswar airport to coordinate aerial relief efforts, the Indian Air Force had also positioned 44 of its elite Garud special forces and a rapid action medical team comprising 37 doctors and paramedics in Ganjam district for similar rescue and relief measures.The Indian Naval Ships Ranvijay and Jalashwa continue in wait in Vishakhapatnam to respond to any alerts for relief even as a survey ship, INS Investigator is currently on its way from Port Blair to Paradip with aid material in case needed. Six teams of Navy divers are also currently at Gopalpur, while ten other similar teams are at Srikakulam area in Andhra Pradesh as part of the Navy's preparedness. At Chilka, Odisha navy divers from the Naval Training establishment also helped villagers affected in the low lying areas that were flooded due to torrential overnight rains.The Coast Guard meanwhile, launched three aerial sorties on Sunday, to locate the missing merchant vessel MV Bingo near Sagar islands off Odisha coast. The ship and crew still remain untraced even as efforts by Coast Guard are on despite a very rough sea state.The Coast Guard also rendered medical assistance to 18 fishermen who were washed ashore after having jumped into the sea from their stranded boats off Paradip. ICGS Samudra Pehradar, one of the bigger ships that the Coast Guard operates is currently augmenting the efforts in the sea off Odisha coast.The cyclone, according to the state authorities here, affected 12 districts covering 14,514 villages affecting nearly 18.5 lakh people. The Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard elements continue to be present in the positions at their locations till the rescue operations are entirely called off.Although the cyclone passed away without a catastrophic fall out, the armed forces had geared up completely to tackle any emergency that could have arisen as a consequence of the cyclone.

Even the admin takes IMD with pinch of salt.I should point out that the only reason this uncertainty and guess work exists is that the IMD has not instituted a hurricane aircraft to sample data within the cyclone. With data sampling none of this speculation would exist and the admin can act on hard data.IMD actually has an excellent Cyclone web page. Very easy even for aam abdul to follow. It was inaccessible almost every time I tried during the cyclone, but now works fine.http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/cyclone.htm----------------------------The analysis has just begun but one note by a meteorologist notes that Phailin began an eye wall replacement just before hitting land and this weakened it.

226,Muppalla,14 Oct 2013 04:25 ,"Super relief: The night govt and IMD saved the dayThe storm has passed. Sunday night, as Cyclone Phailin looked set to dissipate within 36 hours, the Orissa government could pat itself in the back for a massive evacuation that helped save thousands of people from India's fiercest cyclone in 14 years. The death toll in the state stood at 18, most of them dying under falling trees as winds reaching up to 250 km or more battered Ganjam district and with a lesser force other districts. While over 2.34 lakh houses were damaged, less than 12 hours after the cyclone subsided over 'Ground Zero' Ganjam, over 90 per cent of the roads blocked by fallen trees had been cleared. By Sunday evening, Cyclone Phailin had weakened into ""deep depression"". M Mohapatra, Scientist (Cyclone Warning Division) of the Meteorology Department in Delhi, said the cyclonic storm now had wind speed of 45-55 km ph, and was expected to weaken further. Orissa officials attributed the low casualties to record evacuation. In just three days, 9.1 lakh people in 14 districts were evacuated. In Ganjam alone, over 1.82 lakh people were evacuated while another 1.6 lakh rushed to cyclone shelters there on their own ahead of the cyclone. Andhra Pradesh also saw one of its biggest evacuation operations, with over 90,000 people shifted from coastal villages of the Srikakulam district to 49 shelters within 30 hours. The shelters had stocks of food and other essential commodities to last a week. All these were in place, along with an officer in charge of each shelter, by 3 pm Saturday, six hours before the cyclone made landfall in neighbouring Orissa. This ensured there were no casualties in the district. The Srikakulam administration drew up lists of villages, categorised them as dangerous, very vulnerable and vulnerable, and sent text messages to over 10,000 people a day before the cyclone. The level of planning was such that special officers had details of families, numbers of men, women and children, contact numbers of village elders and elected representatives, besides information about the number of vehicles available for evacuation. Adopting a strategy of 'zero loss of life', 247 cyclone shelters were pressed into service in Orissa. However, what made the difference was the 10,000 specially constructed school buildings that housed a major part of the 9,12,848 people who were evacuated from the affected areas. These buildings had been constructed as part of a special plan after the 1999 super cyclone disaster. ""All resources were put to use. This was the largest-ever evacuation at such short notice. We not only provided food and water to all but a week's supply of both was also kept ready at the shelters,"" a senior state government fuctionary said. Special rapid action force teams were placed at strategic locations in districts and fuel was stocked. Alarm bells started going off in Orissa soon after a low-pressure area formed over the North Andaman Sea last week. As the Meteorological Department forecast that this could develop into a very severe cyclone, with wind speeds reaching up to 185-190 km per hour and make landfall somewhere closer to Gopalpur in Orissa, Chief Secretary Jugal Mohapatra took a meeting of the Ganjam district administration. ""In 1999, hardly a few thousand were evacuated. We did not have many cyclone shelters then. The Chief Secretary made it clear that, no matter what, vulnerable people have to be evacuated to safer areas to ensure zero casualties,"" said a Revenue and Disaster Management Department official. ""Mass evacuation was started on the morning of the 10th and by 11th evening, it had been completed. There was information about a few reluctant people in vulnerable areas, and senior officials were asked to intervene. These people too were shifted to shelters by 12th morning. People were cajoled, persuaded or forced to leave,"" an official said. At Ganjam, the district collector identified all the vulnerable villages and possible cyclone shelters nearby. By Saturday evening, when the cyclone made landfall, over 3.5 lakh people from at least five districts in the scope of the cyclone had moved to shelters. In Golabandha village of Ganjam, people were told clearly of the dangers of living within the first 10 km of the coast. ""Though people initially resented forced evacuation, now they are thanking us,"" said a district official. ""The government did microplanning of the work needed to be done after the cyclone hit. Each department's role was identified and they were given targets to complete. There was no confusion over who was to do what,"" Ganjam District Collector Dr Krishan Kumar said. All supporting agencies were told to report to the district collector. In Berhampur, the IAF started a mobile medical unit two days before the storm. ""We were ready with treatment for snake bites to heart attacks and head injuries,"" said Squadron Leader Navneet Kaur of the team. ""It was the evacuation before the landfall that helped minimise the casualties,"" admitted Squadron Leader S P Singh, who was stationed in Berhampur for overseeing the mobile medical units"

The images above show the cyclone and two typhoons now. The first is from Weather Underground; the second, from Quartz meteorologist Eric Holthaus.Typhoon Nari tore through the Philippines with wind gusts up to 116 mph, killing at least 13 people and leaving 2.1 million people without electricity. The storm largely spared Manila, the capital city, which is prone to flooding. Now forming again in the South China Sea, Nari is expected to hit Vietnam on October 14 at a similar strength—Category 3—as when it passed over the Philippines.Typhoon Wipha is a lesser storm at the moment, but it’s strengthening quickly and forecasted to turn north toward Japan. Wipha, which officially became a typhoon yesterday, could pass by Tokyo on October 15 or 16.It’s unusual, though not unheard of, for three named storms to stalk the Eastern Hemisphere at the same time.

As the villagers returned home, they discovered that a restored mangrove plantation helped shelter their vulnerable village from the storm’s wrath.About 40 of the village’s 200 homes were damaged, but residents told Down to Earth that it would have been worse without the mangrove. “In the nearby Sundrikhal and Pentha village, most of the houses have been washed away,” villager Ravindra Behera told the Indian environmental magazine. “We are better off because the forest has taken the initial brunt of the storm.Our elders had made an embankment along the coast to prevent soil erosion in 1975. They randomly planted mangrove trees on the embankment. Gradually, this plantation converted into a mangrove forest. However, it was during the 1982 cyclone that we realized that mangrove can also prevent the storm from reaching us,” said Balram Biswal, another resident.Thereafter, the villagers aggressively started planting mangroves on the island and also made provisions in the village to protect the forests. “We constituted a 15-member forest protection committee from among the villagers. The body penalised anyone who damaged the forests in any possible way and a night guard was appointed and paid Rs 100 per night to protect the mangrove,” said Behera.Today, a dense forest of tall mangrove trees stands between the sea and Praharajpur. Apart from a shield from cyclone, the residents also get wood, honey and fruits from the mangrove. “The story of Praharajpur has also inspired nearby villages to plant and protect mangroves coasts. We hope that the forest comes to their rescue as well,” said Suresh Bisoyi of non-profit Regional Centre for Development Cooperation (RCDC).Scientists and village survivors alike tell us that mangroves and other coastal ecosystems can shield our cities and towns from rising seas and storm surges. Here’s hoping that coastal governors in the U.S. are paying attention, too."

""In Samar, about 200 deaths. Validation is ongoing.""She expected a more exact number to emerge after a more precise counting of bodies on the ground in those regions.Witnesses said bodies covered in plastic were lying on the streets. Television footage shows cars piled atop each other.""The last time I saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean Tsunami,"" said Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, head of the UN Disaster Assessment Coordination Team sent to Tacloban, referring to the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.""This is destruction on a massive scale. There are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris.""The category 5 ""super typhoon"" weakened to a category 4 on Saturday, though forecasters said it could strengthen again over the South China Sea en route to Vietnam.Authorities in 15 provinces in Vietnam have started to call back boats and prepare for possible landslides. Nearly 300,000 people were moved to safer areas in two provinces alone - Da Nang and Quang Nam - according to the government's website.The Philippines has yet to restore communications with officials in Tacloban, a city of about 220,000. A government official estimated at least 100 were killed and more than 100 wounded, but conceded the toll would likely rise sharply.The national disaster agency has yet to confirm the toll but broken power poles, trees, bent tin roofs and splintered houses littered the streets of the city about 580 km (360 miles) southeast of Manila.""It was like a Tsunami""The airport was nearly destroyed as raging seawaters swept through the city, shattering the glass of the airport tower, leveling the terminal and overturning nearby vehicles.""Almost all houses were destroyed, many are totally damaged.

We escaped through the windows and I held on to a pole for about an hour as rain, seawater and wind swept through the airport. Some of my staff survived by clinging to trees. I prayed hard all throughout until the water subsided.""Across the country, about a million people took shelter in 37 provinces after President Benigno Aquino appealed to those in the typhoon's path to leave vulnerable areas.""For casualties, we think it will be substantially more,"" Aquino told reporters.Officials started evacuating residents from low-lying areas, coastlines and hilly villages as early as three days before the typhoon struck on Friday, officials said. But not all headed the call to evacuate.""I saw those big waves and immediately told my neighbors to flee,"" said Floremil Mazo, a villager in southeastern Davao Oriental province.Meteorologists said the impact may not be as strong as feared because the storm was moving so quickly, reducing the risk of flooding and landslides from torrential rain, the biggest causes of typhoon casualties in the Philippines.Ferry services and airports in the central Philippines remained closed, hampering aid deliveries to Tacloban, although the military said three C-130 transport planes managed to land at its airport on Saturday.At least two people were killed on the tourist destination island of Cebu, three in Iloilo province and another three in Coron town in southwestern Palawan province, radio reports said.""I never thought the winds would be that strong that they could destroy my house,"" LynLyn Golfan of Cebu said in a television interview while sifting through the debris.By Saturday afternoon, the typhoon was hovering 765 km west of San Jose in southwestern Occidental Mindoro province, packing winds of a maximum 185 kph, with gusts of up to 220 kph.The storm lashed the islands of Leyte and Samar with 275-kph wind gusts and 5-6 meter (15-19 ft) waves on Friday before scouring the northern tip of Cebu province. It weakened slightly as it moved west-northwest near the tourist island of Boracay, later hitting Mindoro island.Haiyan was the second category 5 typhoon to hit the Philippines this year after Typhoon Usagi in September.

A February report from the National Hurricane Center counted another 72 deaths in the Caribbean and one in Canada.Any of the numbers would rank the storm as one of the 25 or so deadliest cyclones ever to hit the United States, but far behind earlier storms that killed hundreds or thousands.Wiki says Sandy was CAT 2 /3   with max Wind speed of 185 KMPH storm/hurricane. It hit US of A with Wind speed of 130 KMPH only. The most of the fatalities  ( about  73 of 148 ) were in US of A that too after making intensive preparations.

I hope Congress will pay the price in the 2014 elections."
