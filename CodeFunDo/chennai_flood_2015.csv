There is practically no drinking water available anywhere in the city. The Corporation water supply has got contaminated with the sewage flow since Monday. Also power supply has been shut down as a precautionary measure across most parts of the city since Monday evening. Road from IIT-M to Siruseri via OMR has caved in at multiple places.

My street, which is not prone to flooding had knee-deep water last evening. Milk services are normal, at least in my area. Hats off to those truck drivers and the distributors.

18,Kashi,02 Dec 2015 16:59 ,Our urban sewage and drainage systems are a disgrace. They are condemned to remain that way until a major overhaul is taken up which means that the systems are set for years instead of doling out desilting contracts year after year- and therein lies the rub.Chennai residents have my heartfelt sympathy in these trying times. Nature's fury compounded by government insensitivity and callousness has brought us to this situations and its the common folk who end up paying the price once again.

So planners and urban managers have to take these into account, and rainwater redirection I hope is part of that.Ulan Batoriji - this topic is close to the heart of any non profit seeking non governmental non landmafia person in any Indian city""Borewell recharging"" or ""rainwater harvesting"" is a demand made of residents of plots exceeding certain area in Bengaluru, Kerala. The former consists of channeling all rainwater into a kiler pit that needs to be at least 30 feet deep - going through the subsoil rock into the ""real"" subsoil water region. Of course sham holes can be dug of lesser depth. Rain water harvesting is a way by which the city corporation can blame residents for flooding. It is a useless exercise for small plots. Pipes get clogged by leaves and overflow with the first rains and stagnant water after the last rain breeds mosquitoes.The real issue is the the city corporation, development and state govt officials of cities like bengaluru and chennai for decades have lined their pockets by encroaching on water bodies and water channels in the form of selling that land to developers.For example Bengaluru had something like 200 lakes - which are saucer shaped depressions in the ground with little channels (""rivers that run only in the rainy season"") that connected up the lakes - so that rainwater first fills the lakes and the channels allow overflow into a more distant lake. In the dry season the lakes maintain the grounddwater levels.What they have done in Bengaluru (and Chennai, I am told) is to sell the lake beds for building and ""development"" and once the lake bed is built over the channels are permanently dry and they can be built over as well. Everyone in the city knows this, but no one has taken the trouble to inform the rainclouds and the water of this little inconvenient fact. The rain continues to collect in the saucer shaped depressions - and floods the buildings there up to several feet. the overflow water - having nowhere else to flow, flows on the roads. Meanwhile the population, having suddenly been exposed to the joys of plastic wrapping on everything simply dump the plastic on local dumps. Those dumps get washed into drains and drains if any, get clogged. Thus we get the modern  Indian city.  Of course I hear that this same model is followed in cities across the world - but that does not concern me.Bengaluru actually has thriving (and some upmarket) residential locations like ""CT bed. CT bed sounds so cute for the techie who has moved in from outside Bengaluru and paid 2 crore for a flat. CT bed is actually ""ChennammaneKere Tank Bed"" 'Chennamma's lake bed"". There are dozens of localities built on lakes in Bangalore and Chennai. The local government bodies who know no planning and who have made loads of money have simply allowed this construction to occur and those areas become lakes once again. There is no easy short term solution. Removal of the corrupt builder-government nexus is necessary, but it is easier said than done"

Chennai has an active HAM community, and they had also reached out to the government authorities and offered assistance. This was turned down because the state government's own VHF network (mainly police and the fire brigade) are very much active, and they can also easily coordinate with NDRF and other sister-agencies. In TN from what I know even other non-critical departments like state transport have VHF wireless networks.2. Few HAMs are active on HF and VHF (folks who were veterans and had good battery back up systems). For them the biggest challenge is that they cannot move out as their surroundings are flooded. So them collating information, or passing information is now not possible. ----From what I heard, around 8 NDRF battalions are now getting deployed in Chennai.

65,Philip,03 Dec 2015 10:45 ,"Relief:Various cities I understand have official ""drop points"" for relief material.The material reqd.Milk powder,foodstuffs,clothing-preferably shawls,blankets,sheets,dhotis/lungis.I'm not sure about medicine as waterborne diseases will definitely break out and only the local/central authorities with their med teams will be able to dole out med. relief to the masses.Once again we see local authorities overwhelmed by such a catastrophic disaster and unable to get their act together.Why?Firstly,there should be several regional Disaster Relief centres and teams.The DR central management entity should list out the various types of disasters (earthquakes,floods,landslides,fire,industrial accidents like Bhopal,tsunamis,etc.The zones where earthquakes are prevalent are well known,similarly those coastal areas  vulnerable to cyclones,tsunamis,etc. Relief material reqd. for each disaster should be stored closer to the zones with the regional centres so that they get to the  areas affected asap.One has to anticipate that communications will break down and setting up mobile commns centres as the IA possesses should be the first act.Aerial surveillance,UAVs,etc. will give a picture of the devastation and the DR teams can take iut from there.In the case of Chennai/Madras, the local administration of both DMK/AIADMK regimes are the primary culprits. Old Madras of the '70s and '80s also experienced similar massive rainfall but the damage was less.The heaviest day's rainfall was in '76 (still stands) which I experienced.It rained non-stop for a week.low lying areas next to river banks were flooded,apts. for slum dwellers cut off, helo rescues took place,Sanjay Gandhi flew in as well with Central relief. Every decade or so the same has happened and each time you have one or other of the Dravidian parties in power.have they learnt anything? No.One year during this century I was flying back from Cbo and the city was hit with a massive downpour that in just a few hours paralysed the city.We couldn't land as the airport runway was flooded and the landing was aborted seconds before touchdown.We returned to Cbo and flew in a day later.In the last 20 years,there has been an explosion of development,real estate has run amok in cahoots with politicos,and babus,where many builders are or front for politcos. Madras/Chennai has two principal rivers the snakelike Cooum and the Adyar River.The Adyar River is the defining line between north and south madras/Chennai.The old boundary of south Madras used to be Guindy,where the madras IIT and other ed institutions,Raj Bhavan,the Race Club,Guindy Forest and Deer park are located.Beyond this belt was swampy,low-lying land and waterbodies connecting the Buckingham Canal which runs from Andhra N-South.Once a waterway,today it is a stinking sewage canal.The Old Mahabalipuram Rd. (OMR Rd),has seen the sprawl of the concrete jungle racing southwards cutting off the old drainage channels to the sea.This is why places like Tambaram in the suburbs are also flooded.To add to the misery,the tanks which hold the city's fresh water supplies have filled to the brim and water has been let out into the rivers which has swamped the city! The drainage dates back from the British era in parts of the city.Those still I am told work,while the new ones laid down by the D parties function poorly or not at all or simply aren't' there! How many new layouts and neighbourhoods in the urban sprawl have UG drainage? Along with increased concrete paving on the ground,water has no escape route. Bangalore too has its own share of filled up tanks,etc. This is not a unique problem.All major cities located near rivers and waterbodies will experience such problems due to urban sprawl and poor planning.Global warming,cosmic changes are producing more extreme weather conditions,where rainfall in 24 hrs. at extreme times like these are double. Bombay experienced it some years ago and the same reasons came into play even there. The waters will recede,the summer will be extra hot,Chennai will in the future experience water shortage problems, but unless there is a holistic metro master plan put into effect , a proper sewerage and drainage system put in place and natural water bodies meant to soak up the excess rainfall cleaned and protected from the builders ,history will repeat itself. The eco damage to the city and country is catastrophic. Chennai is the ""Detroit city of India"". Right now it is the ""Drowned city of India"".The big Q is whether the politico-babu-builder nexus in the country will listen to reason.The CM of TN is to conduct an ""aerial review"".Why not a ""boat review""? More relevant to see first hand at ground level what ordinary people are experiencing.She perhaps doesn't want her precious toes getting wet?"
66,Sridhar K,03 Dec 2015 11:23 ,"I started from my home on Tuesday morning to drop my wife at Mahindra city at around 7.30. It was drizzling and enroute crossed a small portion of the flooded road in Selaiyur and then got stuck in irumbiluy bridge for an hour. Then got stuck at Zoo junction for close to another hour. WThey closed the lane towards Chinglepet on account of it getting flooded. We were asked to take the other lane. Saw an half submerged SRM college bus. Water was gushing on our lane but managed to reach Guduvanchery.  We then decided to return home itself as Rain was picking up. Pulled over to have breakfast and filled up diesel on my car.. Then reached Tambaram and instead of taking Selaiyur route tried to reach home via Chromepet. Got stuck near the Govt hospital which got flooded and they started shifting the patients to top floor. Returned back to Tambaram to try the Selaiyur route again but the road got flooded badly. While crossing the bridge saw the tracks getting submerged. Then reached Chromepet via east Tambaram and after Hastinapuram, the road to my home was cut as the canal enroute had breached flooding the culvert. Decided to park the car near my friends place and walk across the culvert. Since the current was so strong, Police stopped people from crossing it Went back to Chromepet try going home via Pallavaram Thuraipakkam road and Kovilamabakkam but could not manage to cross vettri theater as the road got blocked on one side. Then returned back and decided to take refuge in my friend's place. Spent time from 10.30 am  to 3.30 pm in trying to cover the last couple of miles to my home before giving up. Was safe in my friends place. The rain became relentless with no power. My friends neighbors house were getting flooded and they started taking refuge in my friends house. We then decided to walk down home through an interior route which never gets flooded but only accessible through walk. After walking for 1 km in shin level water, the water started increasing drastically. We neared a raid junction and it was crossing river in full flow. Policemen stopped us from proceeding further as the even the high grounds were flooded because the chitlapakkam lake got breached.  Policemen and local offiicials were standing in heavy rains and directing people to safety. We then returned to my friends place. Next day morning water has receded and we scouted for a route home and made it back home.in my street there was 2 feet of water and there were other streets in my colony which were flooded in three feet of water. Came to know that our maid was about to drown while her way back home but was saved by two motorcyclist. The worst news was that my relative whom I had dropped at Guduvanchery had to wade through 4 feet of water to reach home. However water started to enter his house whose floor was at 5 feet above the road. Water started to increase to almost 3 feet above the floor or in other words 8 feet from the ground within an hour. He could not climb up the stairs without drowning. He then climbed on to the kitchen table and fortunately water receded after reaching the height of the kitchen table. Next day morning the water level receded furher to half a feet above the street. The flooding was caused my encroaches on the lake bed breaking the lake walls on the opposite side to save their ara from getting flooded. We were trying to reach out to emergency services trying to help him but night, and roads to the place getting choked with vehicles. Being helpless finally got news from him at 2.30 am that water has receded before we had slept off. Ordeal in the suburbs got over a bit but Chennai city got affected due to 40k cusecs of water that got discharged from Chembarambakkam lake. Tyevturn of events were very quick and no body expected things to get worse so quickly. The local police corporations and people were doing tremendous job ad kudos to the spirit of the people.  Humanity at its very best.My grand mom at Srinagar colony near Saidapet had to be shifted to second floor in the same apartment. The area was accessible from. Raj Bhavan only by boat and coast gaaurd. They felt that she is safe in the apartment than being shifted elsewhere. Fortunately with help from good Samaritans everywhere death toll was low and it is a story of people getting stranded.  The post flood problems of milk vegetables etc have started. Hopefully things will improve"

Know what the Buckingham Canal is ? Know what has become of them ? How about getting THEM cleaned up and useable first before getting on to a fool's errand of digging canals to create squatter colonies and sewage filled cess pools that stink to high heavens ? Yeah, that said, you probably need new storm water drains and holding canals in the souther part of the city, roughly south of the GST road, all the way into Chengalpet district to the edge of Mahabalipuram . Those former wet lands have taken  beating.The traditional T Nagar/Anna Nagar kind of areas can be fixed with a rejuvenated Buckingham Canal/ Cooum/ Adayar river feeder ... And probably some way to take away surplus of Chembarambakkam and Red Hills lakes away from the city to wards the river that drains into the sea at Kalpakkam (Palar?) . That obviously has much higher carrying capacity than the Adayar and Buckingham canal systems."

77,vina,03 Dec 2015 13:35 ,"I could see dozers and powered claw things at the mouth of the buckingham canal(?) near Fort st george on my last visit. the water was a vile colour and smell and had no visible flow.That is the Cooum river mouth. The Buckingham canal starts connects Pulicat Lake (where Sriharikota is) and connects Muthukkadu /Kovalm Beach/ Taj Vivanta  (draining into the Salt Lake backwaters) and drains the minor lakes and rivers along the way .My grandma long ago  told me that  when she was a school kid (Lady Wellingdon school, Triplicane, 1918s or so, she was a matriculate in those days)  for their school excursion to Mahabalipuram, they used to take a boat along Buckingham canal and go there!The entire system was an inland waterway , extending from Pulicat to Mahablipram via canal system. Since the Brits left, after independence, it has been destroyed and turned into an open sewage , with encroachments and all sides.Chennai really has a ready made storm water drain system with the Buckingham canal, Cooum river and the Adayar river along with the great salt lake at Muthukkadu. If only it is properly used and not encroached upon by the Politoc/Babu/Builder/Slum Dweller mafia.Same case with Bangalore and all it's lakes and the canals linking the lakes, built by the Mysore Maharajas, ruined by the ""democratically"" elected govts since independence. The system in Bangalore is beautiful, with overflow of upper reaches canals, flowing to lakes downstream and so on. Now it is a fetid mess with sewage running on it, with encroachments all over."

Heck 5 cm in a day feels like you're going to drown. No city can seriously cope with such rainfall, but having the right topography probably helps.

103,arshyam,03 Dec 2015 20:28 ,"^^ That's definitely not Pallavaram, but the outer ring road, quite far from it. There is not much habitation around that road yet, as it is newly built and planned far away from existing pockets.There are no similar pics in drier times, unless the IAF has some, since it is an aerial shot. From the ground level, there are a few pics of the road in general, but cannot be sure whether they are of the same location as that flooded pic above. I am posting them anyway to give an idea of the geography.SourceSourceThis is the Pallavaram flyover, as you can see, the lampposts are different. Plus the Pallavaram flyover is a rotary junction at the top, so vehicles can take a turn toward Thoraipakkam/Velachery (link to Google satellite map). The ORR pic however, shows two straight carriageways, since the highway goes above a local road, which is definitely flooded. The middle space between the flyovers is the 20 metre open space reserved for a future public transport corridor (MRTS/BRTS).Request mods to help re-size the above image, since I am not able to. I posted them inline on purpose, since people seem to be shocked by this instance thinking it is a highly populated area. It is not. Please feel free to delete this bolded portion after re-sizing."

105,arshyam,03 Dec 2015 20:57 ,"williams wrote:Govt need to build 4 or 5 storm water channels around the city. The channels can eventually drain into the sea. It is a simple common sense work city PWD can undertake to stop this kind of disaster in future. That said, it is great to see the people working together calmly to help each other.It's not so simple. True, the natural channels are blocked by silt, encroachments and etc., and lakes built up over, or shrunk in size, leading to less water retention capacity. But that's not all. There have been storm water drains built in various places to alleviate flooding, and they have worked to an extent. For instance, Velachery has a 6 feet wide drain to take excess water away from the locality, into the Pallikaranai marsh. This has helped to an extent in the past few years. This past month, though, this drain has been draining to full capacity, but the quantum of water is so much that it cannot drain fast enough. Hence the flooding visuals we see about Velachery. But even this month, unlike in years past when this drain wasn't there, the water was drained off in a day or two, and areas notorious for flooding within Velachery were back to normal. Another example the baby channel built in the Cooum as part of its cleaning. Due to this, areas like Anna Nagar and Mogappair didn't experience prolonged flooding, and the water drained relatively quickly.The same problem repeats now, with a twist though. The Pallikaranai marsh is full, and it's own drain to the ocean goes through the Buckingham canal, which also is full. So this time around, the water won't drain as fast simply due to lack of space. The quantum of rain we got this month is unbelievable, and so flooding will happen. Look at the stats: on Tue alone, Chennai received 27.5 cm of rain. Heck, suburbs like Tambaram received 49 cm of rain on Tuesday, which is on top of the earlier spells of rain, which cumulatively totaled 108.8 cm in Nov, the normal average being only 40cm for the entire month! The entire month of Dec gets only 19 cm usually, and that was exceeded in a single day, with more to come. There is only so much we can do against nature's fury. Heavy rain events happen once in a decade, and some flooding happens. But this time around is a once in a century event.  We may not be able to prevent them fully, but at least ensure that the water drains off soon. This past month, for all their faults, the city admin had ensured that - they proactively acted upon standing pools of water and even broke up roads to drain the water. The reason? Preventing outbreak of water borne diseases, especially dengue. It is a testament to their effort that no outbreak happened in the past month. Could they have done better? Of course, but they did try their best.In general, one cannot build structures optimised for once in a century events.Having said that, a few things can be done to improve things. Clear all existing waterways and desilt their mouths regularly. This includes the Cooum, Kosathaliyar, Adyar, and the Buckingham canal. Then expedite the canal works from the Pallikaranai marsh direct to the sea, instead of letting it drain to the Buckingham canal as it currently does. That will add a good amount of capacity. Unfortunately, the SG didn't implement this project for some reason, and the CAG rapped them for this last week. Mark out flood plains and stop notifying layouts here. The city has lots of room to expand, use the interiors for planned layouts that are not on flood plains. The well planned radial roads here ensure good traffic movement, so these layouts will be attractive to prospective buyers. Relocate all garbage dumps away from flood plains. The Thoraipakkam one itself is causing most of the problems. Lastly, stop dumping the damn sewage into the rivers - the biggest cuplrits in this are the govt agencies themselves. Idiots."
106,Sridhar K,03 Dec 2015 21:15 ,"ArshyamGood posts. The civic authorities, police deserve a huge thank you. Areas that were flooded were clear ed up in no time in some of the suburbs by cutting of canals, roads and dividers to make the water flow. EB was working overtime to restore power in areas where there is no water logging.  Some areas they were using earth movers to move people to safety. Heard that my office in DLF IT park got flooded in the basement. The  3 level basement held so much water that it saved those neighboring areas some impact. It seems DLF did not plan for drainage in the basement but that major flaw helped retain a lot of water. Lots of cars in L & T were floating on the road.We are with power but no fuel, arms out of cash no milk but there is power outage in large parts of Chennai now. Mobile networks are jammed but things are improvingMy office in DLF"

Ground floor was flooded, no electricity, no fresh water, 15 people and a dog in the first floor. He was making posts every few hours trying to get someone to send a boat and their phones were all running low. Rescue boats in his area were non-existent, because they seem to have their hands full in other parts of the city (he's in the Pallikaranai area). Finally, his friend from primary school and another guy managed to get some rescuers sent their way. As he posted later, it wasn't the police, army, navy or fire department that came to their aid, but some local fishermen in two private boats, which came all the way from Marina beach!He says water is about 8 feet deep in the Balaji dental college area. One boat dropped them off in a small dry area and went back to pick up more residents, while the other boat carried the elderly, mothers and children further on. The rest walked onwards in waist deep water until they got to a larger dry area, from which everyone took vehicles (tempo, auto etc.) to their final destinations."

All systems are designed for a particular capacity, which is based on averages. Anything exceeding the average will lead to flooding. Here, we had 3 times the average amount of rainfall in the wettest month of the year (source: IMD Chennai), that too in a span of a week. The best thing to do then is to ensure the flooded waters drain as quickly as possible. Admittedly, there is work needed on that front, and massa style infra will help that drainage. Won't prevent flooding though. The same massa infra does not prevent flooding everywhere, does it? I remember this one instance very clearly, when the interstate I-5 went under due to a local tropical storm. One might also want to look at the amount of rainfall that caused the flooding and compare with the stats below.Re-posting the stats from the previous page to give an idea about capacity:Code: Select allMonth            Average (cm)         Received (cm)Nov               40                        108.8 Dec               19                        27.5 (Dec 1 alone, Tambaram recd. 49cm on the same day)"

Following friends and family in Whatsapp group, the rain and its problems were being discussed in mid November itself. It was bad per what I read on the messages; there was a photo of a snake sitting on a toilet. I thought it was photoshoed. Lots of jokes were going around about the plight of people. Schools and offices were being closed, but lots of humor was still around - there was not a sense of panic. There were 100 deaths by this time. Slowly things started changing, each rain brought more problems. I think the last rain tipped it over. You need to know there is Save-Modi-Brigade in every corner of this World  . So if you ranted in nukkad, your choice of words did not go properly I guess. I tweeted a few times to Sri Modi Garu and his office onlee. Nammala moodichandu avalo dhan.Somebody in FB, had posted a tweet of Actor Siddarth who called out the national attention. The actual Madrasis are still not blaming anyone for the most part.

They refused to take my word and demanded to see a ""newspaper"" report about the lightening strike because as per them such a significant event would heve been reported in the press.

191,Suraj,04 Dec 2015 12:56 ,"Insurance will not pay for the damage in Chennai. Flood damage is usually a separate policy, and it typically does not go into effect immediately but only after a period of time, so people don't simply go out and buy policies the day before heavy rain is forecast. The total damage in Chennai will amount to billions of dollars, perhaps Rs.50,000 cr or more. It's not something a collection of insurance policies can fix, but under able stewardship, it's a fantastic opportunity for the city to rebuild on modern lines that no other major Indian metro can. The quesion really is, is there such will ? The central government can support the measure in various ways. For example, there's a recent push to enable states and cities to independently issue their own bond offerings."

Luckily not much report of transformer damages as that takes time.PM Relief  fund or national calamity fund can not be used to reimburse individual losses. I am afraid these would have to be by themselves.There are still pockets of flooded areas where people are stranded and they have to be evacuated , hopefully by today or tomorrow.

Ground floor was flooded, no electricity, no fresh water, 15 people and a dog in the first floor. He was making posts every few hours trying to get someone to send a boat and their phones were all running low. Rescue boats in his area were non-existent, because they seem to have their hands full in other parts of the city (he's in the Pallikaranai area). Finally, his friend from primary school and another guy managed to get some rescuers sent their way. As he posted later, it wasn't the police, army, navy or fire department that came to their aid, but some local fishermen in two private boats, which came all the way from Marina beach!He says water is about 8 feet deep in the Balaji dental college area. One boat dropped them off in a small dry area and went back to pick up more residents, while the other boat carried the elderly, mothers and children further on. The rest walked onwards in waist deep water until they got to a larger dry area, from which everyone took vehicles (tempo, auto etc.) to their final destinations.Said friend and his SHQ couldn't sleep last night remembering the hundreds of people stranded, while they had sailed out in rented boats. This morning, they called up the fishermen and rehired the same boats that they were rescued in yesterday, went door-to-door and collected about 200 food packets, cooked a bunch more and then headed out back to their locality. On the way, they met a couple of guys that had about 1000 packets of food, but didn't know where to donate it. So they combined and went to their area and spent the next 4 hours going to the deep water areas and distributing food/water. Apparently, there are still some places in their area where the water is around 6-8 feet and people can't leave their houses. They were done distributing their stuff late in the afternoon when a Navy truck showed up with more food/water, so my friend volunteered to go with their boats and show them the route.

Suburban areas in South-West Chennai like Tambaram, Velachery, Mudichur, Koyambedu, Sholinganallur, OMR(IT-CORRIDOR), Kotturpuram, Saidapet, Guindy and Adyar are badly affected due to excess water which was let out from Chembarambakkam reservoir on 1/12/2015.

223,arshyam,05 Dec 2015 00:26 ,"Prime Minister's Gesture Welcome  - The New Indian ExpressChennai’s plight has moved the country and it seems, even the Rain Gods, for a change, had a change of mind Thursday. Though overcast, the skies didn’t open up until evening, giving Chennaiites much-needed breather and letting the armed forces, NDRF and the State government mount a massive relief and rescue operation. The brief window has also given us an indication of the sheer scale of the devastation caused in the last few days, particularly on, what could only be called, the Terrible Tuesday. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has confirmed that Chennai received in those 24 hours 330 mm rainfall, much more than the 250 mm it generally gets in the whole of December — a 100-year record. Where does this leave Tamil Nadu?Coupled with the recent, almost as devastating rainfall, the State is now looking at an unprecedented crisis. The previous spell alone had left in its wake an `8,481-crore loss — this quantification doesn’t really convey the tragedy. Analyse this: 269 people have lost their lives; by one estimate, three million are deprived of basic services; railway station and the airport are shut; bus services are paralysed; power supply is snapped and hundreds are undergoing treatment in various hospitals, some of them in critical condition. Besides, several hundreds are still stranded — in railway stations, flooded homes, on rooftops and streets. For, as Rajnath Singh pointed out, Chennai is now practically an island. The NDRF has so far rescued over 2,000 people and as we write, the IAF is ferrying hundreds to safety as is the Army.What I'd been saying all along, but was called out as mai-baap culture  Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa has activated the State apparatus with commendable alacrity and surveyed the marooned areas. But, the magnitude of this tragedy is too much to cope for the State alone. It’s heart-warming to see Prime Minister Narendra Modi rushing to Chennai to see for himself Tamil Nadu’s suffering. The Centre has already promised every possible help, and the PM has announced `1,000 crore more as immediate relief in addition to the `940 crore already sanctioned. Gestures like these give confidence, but it’s the consistent follow-up action that really counts. Going by the speed with which the State government and the Centre have responded — not to forget the armed forces — there is every reason to believe Tamil Nadu will overcome this crisis. Even if, as the weatherman is warning, the worst is not over yet."

The Corporation staff, police, firefighters initially and later the armed forces & NDRF have done a tremendous job. Of course, hundreds of volunteers both individually and through voluntary organizations have pitched in. No words can be sufficient to express appreciation for all of them. The only criticism that I would place against the government would be that they were caught off guard though the met office including from other countries had predicted extremely heavy rains. That is a serious charge still.Drainage issues, encroachments on water bodies, being ill-prepared are endemic and I am afraid no change will happen. It is impossible to tear down all those constructions even if people choose not to live in many of these anymore. Everything will be forgotten in due course and this will continue as before. That would be the biggest tragedy.Cuddalore, which bore the brunt of Tsunami too, is even more badly affected. That district is normally prone to cyclones too. It will take a few days for a true picture to emerge provided rains stop now. Unfortunately, southern districts are under very heavy rains as I write this. Very heavy rains in Nellore, Chittoor etc are causing flooding in Palar, Arani river. This will bring more waters into Chennai too. As a result, the already full Poondi reservoir in Tiruvalloor is receiving 10000 cusecs right now. The Kosasthalayar river connects the Poondi reservoir with Cholavaram Reservoir. There is also a link canal from Poondi to Chembarambakkam reservoir. This excess water on this link canal joins Cooum river at Aranvayal. Whenever the floodgates of Poondi reservoir are opened, water gets drained into the sea through the Kosasthalaiyar river near the Ennore creek. This has caused huge flooding in North Chennai. The man-made Buckingham Canal interlinks Cooum & the Adyar and flows past Mahabalipuram to almost Pondicherry. Over the years, all these rivers have shrunk in capacity due to encroachment and a lack of maintenance. Their outlets into the Bay have not been dredged frequently and systematically. They are therefore unable to discharge freely into the BoB.Clouds are threatening in Chennai too and there has been intermittent heavy showers since last afternoon. There is a warning of very heavy rains early next week. Hope that does not happen."

Isolated rainfall occurred over interior Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and south interior Karnataka.Chief amounts of rainfall recorded in centimetres are Nagapattinam and Cuddalore-9 each; Pondicherry-8; Cheyyur and Karaikal-7 each; Sethiathope and Sirkali-6 each; and Panruti, Anaikaranchatram, Parangipettai, and Marakkanam-5 each.The causative low-pressure area persisted over South-West Bay of Bengal and adjoining Sri Lanka off the Tamil Nadu coast.Rain watchIn an extended forecast, the Met said that rain or thundershowers would continue to lash many places over South Peninsular India and at a few places along the West Coast for another week (until December 11). The US Climate Prediction Centre has maintained a rain watch that covers the entire area from Chennai to the South of Tamil Nadu coast, the peninsular tip (Kanyakumari) and North Sri Lanka during the week ending Wednesday.It is again Chennai and neighbourhood which have been put on notice for rain watch during the week that follows i.e. from December 10 to 16.Cyclonic whirlAs for the short-term outlook for four days beginning tomorrow (Saturday), the following is the assessment of the Met Department.Saturday: Heavy rain at isolated places over Coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Sunday: Heavy rain at isolated places over Coastal Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Kerala.Monday: Heavy rainfall at isolated places over Kerala, Lakshadweep, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Tuesday: Heavy rainfall at isolated places over Lakshadweep.The movement of the rain belt from South-East Tamil Nadu and adjoining Sri Lanka around the peninsular tip and onward to the Lakshadweep Sea tracks that of the low-pressure area and its embedded cyclonic circulation and the larger trough that hosts the twosome.In this manner, the rains should dry up over Tamil Nadu but the southward movement of an anti-cyclone from North India is seen squeezing available easterly winds of its moisture over North Tamil Nadu.This is what should continue to fall as rain over Chennai and its neighbourhood.

So, when the river overflowed its banks, the big hole that was the Metro tunnel proved an entry channel.The water coursed through the tunnels right up to the heart of the arterial road, Anna Salai, where the approach for three Metro stations had been dug.For the first time, the central and south Chennai neighbourhoods of Alwarpet, Teynampet and T. Nagar were under sloshing rainwater.“Floodwaters in Chennai usually stagnate for a day but this time they have entered new areas and are staying put,” S. Ramakrishnan of Sriram Nagar observed.A senior railway official whose Alwarpet home is flooded, with his two cars submerged in the basement, said this had never happened before and the only reason could be the Metro tunnel.“Metro officials admitted they had not anticipated such a turn of events, since the Adyar’s earlier flood history showed it had swirled over the bridge only once in 1986, that too for just a few hours.”Residential areas like Anna Nagar and Shenoy Nagar, below which another underground segment of the Metro runs, too experienced floodwaters at doorsteps for the first time.A Metro engineer said a way had to be found to prevent a repeat that could prove disastrous once the underground section becomes operational.The lone section of the Metro that is operational – an elevated portion inaugurated in July – has been a hit during these floods, though, with surface-level trains and buses severely crippled. Its hours have been extended."

Operations at the Chennai airport were shut after a flooded runway forced the cancellation of all flights on Tuesday.    Meanwhile, train services will remain suspended till today, officials have said. The Home Secretary will chair a meeting with top officials from the NDRF and the Railway, Power and Telecom ministries in Delhi to discuss the situation.    Many areas of the city, which is slowly limping back to normalcy after experiencing record rain, are still waterlogged. Parts like Velachery, Muni Pakkam, Thuraipakkam, Tambaram, and Sholinganallur are still inundated. Relief effort by the Army, national and state disaster response forces are still continuing here.    It has been raining intermittently since last night. The Met department has predicted ""light to moderate"" rainfall till Sunday. In areas where water has receded, people are able to move out of their houses to procure essential commodities. Long queues can be seen at ATMs and petrol pumps.    The Tamil Nadu government claims about 80 per cent of power facilities have been restored. It also says 65 per cent bus services have resumed. Arranging safe drinking water still remains the biggest challenge for authorities. Prices of milk, vegetables and food items have also skyrocketed because of short supply. Milk is being sold for Rs. 100 a litre in some places. A bottle of mineral water costing Rs. 20 is being sold for Rs. 150. Vegetables like tomato and beans are being sold for Rs. 80 to Rs. 90 a kg.

252,arshyam,05 Dec 2015 17:58 ,"^^ Last I heard, it was not affected. I must admit I was surprised since the terminus is Velachery, and water accumulates around the station.When Metro and MRTS saved the day - The Hindu, dated Dec 5 2015Chennai Metro Rail sees nearly empty coaches on weekdays. But on Thursday, it resembled an MTC bus, as through the day, it received one lakh passengers.Commuters were jostling and occupying every inch available to reach their destinations; most of them were trying to get to Koyambedu.“It was my only hope to get my family to Koyambedu from Nanganallur. My wife and children will then take a bus to Tiruchi from there,” P. Thirunavukkarasu says.Wheelchair-bound P. Ashok says he was stranded without help for hours and finally managed to leave his house with the help of his friends.“But for the Metro Rail today, I can’t imagine how I would be travelling to Koyambedu today,” he says.But that’s not all. Chennai Metro Rail stations have been used as a source of power for charging their mobiles for hundreds of people . P. Nandakumar, a resident of Ekkatuthangal, which has been cut off from other areas, brought a junction box from his residence and helped many.For many commuters, mostly those from Velachery and Kotturpuram, the MRTS proved to be a lifeline on Thursday. Many people were seen queuing up and buying tickets at Mandeveli, Kasturibai Nagar and Kotturpuram. “Most of us managed to vacate our hostel today and are going to Chintadripet to a friend’s house. We had to walk till Madhya Kailash from Shastri Nagar and are glad to see the trains functioning,” said K. Mary, who was boarding the train from Kasturibai Nagar Station.While the trains from Beach station to Velachery were relatively less crowded, the services from Velachery to Beach were jam-packed. There was one difference: instead of working professionals and students, which make up most of the regular crowd on the MRTS line, the trains were filled with families and groups of concerned and worried residents.At the ticket counters in most stations, notices were pasted stating that trains from Chennai Central had been cancelled. As they are dry, most MRTS stations, especially the one at Chintadripet, are serving as shelters."

It was bizarre when they declared the airport would open on Dec. 6th when water had even entered the terminal! If this picture is to be believed, water came out of the other side of the terminal into the drop-off/pickup areas. Again, not sure if the pictures are for Chennai airport (it does say so) but the escalator area was  under almost knee-deep water. http://www.thecourierdaily.com/chennai- ... 2015/7645/I think water would have found its way into basement if there is a door to basement in vicinity. All the electrical connections/equipment  floor level and below will be damaged (escalator may have damage). One would expect basement to have a/c equipment, power distribution boxes etc.From the above note by Chaanakya, it seems that the airport does not have power (maybe only emergency power), and they have not started pumping out water. Not sure but I think the floodwater is coming from Adayar river (judging by the silt deposited on the runway (it does not look like just rain water), upto runway and terminal, and unless Adayar recedes sufficiently, the airport can not prepare for commercial traffic (maybe just some military or emergency flights). Pure guess but after city power is restored to airport so pumping can begin, it might still be a week to make sure everything is functional and safe.svenkat: that video of saidapet bridge was scary."

It starts with expression of  fury, or atleast an opinion. The good news is that atleast it is being expressed. Whether or not they indulge in such cheap publicity next time, I do hope the people form an expectation that the govt (amma or kalaignar)  ought to pro-actively help in disaster situations, either through early warning and preparation, or disaster relief later on, and that it is the people's right to expect it. This applies to ALL of India and not just TN.Added later:Sorry to take it off on a political tangent. This is still an information-and-relief thread.

When the ‘amphibious seep’ finally arrived on Tuesday, Mr. Shankar rushed to Kottupuram and met officials, offering to help in the rescue and relief efforts.By March 1943, Ford had built 12,778 Seeps which marked its presence by dropping Allied troops on to Normandy in ‘Operation Neptune’ on June 6, 1944.The landing is considered the most decisive military operations that quickened the destruction of the Nazi regime.While the officers in Chennai first hesitated, they quickly realised how efficient the ‘amphibious’ jeep was in manoeuvring in deep waters. In Kotturpuram, Mr. Shankar braved strong currents of the Adayar river in spate to distribute food packets to stranded residents. “At one point, the current was so strong that I swirled with the vehicle. I had to hook the vehicle to a building and then distribute the food packets,” he said.Mr. Shankar has a special mechanic, Udhayasuriyan, who has been with his family for thirty years and takes care of the Seep, which runs on petrol.“After World War II, the British brought a few of these vehicles to be put to use in the Brahmaputra. When they were leaving India, some were sold off to locals. My grandfather picked one,” he said.Mr. Shankar was so much in demand on Saturday that much of the food distribution to flood-affected colonies happened on his Seep. “When I looked at how the people were stranded, my conscience did not let me stay idle. Miners are usually seen as troublemakers. I also wanted to prove that notion wrong. We are also very much human,” he said.Ford GPA, deployed to drop Allied troops on Normandy Beach, delivers food packets"

319,SriKumar,06 Dec 2015 18:35 ,"^^^ I think so. The facebook link does say  Airforce and NDRF.A lot of planning has to go into an operation like this, so I think some trained personnel (NDRF) would have managed the operations at this end. Also, the rotor downwash can be pretty powerful and sweep people off (pregnant women), they had to use the lightest chopper they had. Any number of  things could have gone wrong. And there was a crowd around, any thing off kilter and a lot of people would have been at risk. The helicopter chaps made it look easy.The two NDRF guys were standing, the pregnant woman was sitting with one NDRF guy  holding her hand. As teh chopper came close by, she stood up and the chair on which she was sitting was tossed down to clear the area. She gets in, the chopper moves away but comes back for a bag of stuff, and then goes on. I think the other chopper kept stayed around to observe until the operation was over."

I remember during the aftermath of Tsunami in DECEMBER 2004 and how even the uber-anti-hindu 'THE HINDU' newspaper had articles complaining about the menace of Christian Preachers + Women Assistants going aggressively after the affected folks & using relief materials as a hook to get them to convert into Christianity. Even the My-Ears-Were-Bitten-By-Tyson Mr.Evander Holyfield came to Cuddalore, Nagapattinam at that time to sort of look at how their denomination of christianity was doing their 'releief' work in Tsunami Affected areas.

I put a call for repair and they turned up to fix a broken like and also asked about broadband if it was functioning. Other numbers were not working majority of time with perhaps sole exception of airtel, as per some tweets and reports. As Mobile towers lost power and fuel  ran short they went  kaput and when cellphones  were mostly needed they were not working. Also charging was a problem when there was no power. I had battery backup 10500ma so could charge till power was restored, which was pretty fast as area is not flooded. But for thousands cellphones were dead as bricks, of no use when there is emergency due to natural calamity.Some thought should be spared for working out reliability of network in difficult times.Another thought came to my mind . we should set up centralised control rooms+ backup in each state( with subcontrol rooms)  with common  emergency number for all types of emergencies. This control room should activate first responders of appropriate services , single or multiple.On lines of NDRF states should set up SDRF and should be trained to work in close coordination with NDRF and other agencies.JMHT"

333,SaraLax,06 Dec 2015 21:07 ,"I am coming online only now - almost a week after the deluge & the complete cutting off the city from rest of the world. I am based in K.K.Nagar and on a very 'prime road' - which i discovered this year as something that used to be a small lake some 2 decades before. It was really bad & scary at times since i have a 6 month as well as a 6 year old daughter - to take care off. I ventured through the nearby water filled streets a few times to hunt for veggies/fruits, bread/biscuits/cakes, milk/milk powders, candles, lighters/match boxes & etc. But things were emptying at a never before seen fast rate and i even gave 100 INR to a shop owner - to reserve milk packets for me for the next day - but it didn't work out.  #No Power since last Tuesday morning returned back today morning only after 4+ days. The water pump motors were switched with trepidation hoping it wont run into any issues - since you cant find any worthwhile mechanic in my area right now. But people in general held on firmly with constant prayer in their lips, sharing things around and there was no untoward incident in my flats. But old people in this type of a disastrous, boxed-up living scenario are in a very very bad situation. a 80+ yr old no-so-healthy-lady had to be taken out of our flat through a fish cart (by her resourceful grand children)  like vehicle since her other children in the relatively less affected areas of the city were concerned about her getting locked-out in 3 ft stagnant water for many days continuously sans any power/good water/milk and etc.#No network connection from last Wednesday (BSNL & others) but only Airtel held up through the rains & floods but still was completely jammed. #No milk since Wednesday (heck - even the tea bars were forced to sell black tea & black coffee at 5 INR for almost 2 days in the middle of this week in my locality). My Milk Vendor, apparently from nearby MGR Nagar, (who drives a Bullet bike & drops milk packets) went missing and I cannot contact him on his cell. But then MGR Nagar is one of the worst affected due to overflowing water from canals channeling water between lakes & the bay of bengal.#No power & hence no water & so we had to catch rain water in the terrace when it rained & it did rain copiously even yesterday. There were lots of innovative thoughts ... use mouthwash instead of wasting good water when it is running really low, use lighters if no matchboxes are available to light candles and etc.#My first daughter's private CBSE school has been in holidays since November 7th and the holidays continue further !!. Hopefully she learns something from this disaster even though she is only 6 years old.  #The worst thing was that the TASMAC shop in my heavily flooded locality was open on all days inspite of lack of potable water/milk/power and etc !. Most of my colleagues with flats & houses in areas south of OMR - have suffered a lot more than other areas of the city. Chennai will need atleast 1 month period of no-rains & only-sunshine for it to recover to some sort of normalcy. Families are sending away their woman folks & kids to their native places & relative's places outside of Chennai. There is no ticket charges when travelling through state owned buses and certain private omni bus operator run buses too - for a few more days. There is no BSNL service charges for a few more days in Chennai - too.ADMK should say goodbye to their chances to get re-elected in 2016.

Mobile networks are the best during flooding/earthquakes etc. as cables can easily be cut/shorted.Regarding the centralised control rooms, is there a reason why we have had different numbers for different services? Earlier, there was 100 (Police), 101 (Fire?), 103 (Ambulance), now we have 108 (Ambulance), 1088, and various other numbers on top.

Setting up an integrated call center like 911 is the first hurdle, making it resilient is another. The local govts at massa spend an obscene amount of money to keep it going. Check out DOITT at NYC, the agency responsible for setting up and maintaining this. Even in cities like NYC it was always a touch and go issue. We were able to do 311 because of one guy - Mike Bloomberg. He rammed it down through the city agencies and had tight deadlines and made sure we met them on time."

Not even Germany, France or UK.What we can do is learn from them, and adapt to where we can, using our own home-grown technologies, which is, fortunately, available. But, unfortunately, Amma or K.Nidhi can't make 30-40% cuts because these technologies are under DRDO, BARC, ISRO or other public sector."
344,UlanBatori,07 Dec 2015 05:05 ,"My heart goes out to hardy Chennai people. Perhaps the real need, once the clothes are dried out, is to organize these same fantastic communication networks and make sure the likes of Amma and KN are **NEVER AGAIN** allowed to pollute the political leadership. In fact if Amma were dunked repeatedly in the Cooum she would have splashed most of the floodwater into the ocean. I know I will get hammered for saying this, and it is very insensitive etc etc, but there was no  NATURAL calamity in Chennai. All that happened is a downpour for several days that delivered a year's worth of rains. No earthquake. No cyclonic storm. No WMD attack. No epidemic. Yet. Point is, all those are very possible. It rains in November/December in Chennai. Rains very heavily on some days. Back in 1975 there was a cyclone that seemed headed straight for IIT hostels as per radio report at 1am, when I went to sleep confident that the Design of Machine Elements final exam would be postponed (hopefully cancelled entirely...). Somewhere around 2am it (meaning cyclone not exam) changed course and slammed some 100 miles south of Chennai. Killed 500-1000 people per official estimates, which made it a lot less horrible than the monsters that regularly strike 200 miles north. The Calamity in Chennai then was that the DME Final Exam went ahead as scheduled, in drenching rain.   Such rain events have occurred in Mumbai fairly recently. Was there any effort in Chennai based on that, to prepare? So how unlikely is a major cyclone striking Chennai? Or just standing off the coast for a week dumping a deluge? Why can't uber-smart Tamil voters get leaders who insist on good planning for this major city? Times have not been tough in Chennai overall - the problem is burgeoning prosperity with tons of tax money going into the pockets of TN politicians, hain?  10 months of the year, TN and Chennai has drinking water shortage due to poor water reserves. Now ppl are thirsty because of floods, with no provision to take these flood waters inland to groundwater collection areas. Pathetic. Reminds me of the 'Veeranam Water Project"" that had its pipes lying at the front gate of IITM from at least early 1970s to late 1980s. Maybe got swept away now. The subway tunnels appear to have been dug and left exposed in November - based on what engineering, I wonder...  So water piped nicely and came shooting out in the middle of major thoroughfares and in residential areas such as AnnaNagar. This thread is an excellent case study in emergency response - by tough, smart people. Hope it can be turned into something lasting. But all the good knowledge cannot save TN and Chennai until the top political layer is swept into the Cooum and the Buckingham Canal along with the rest of the sewage. The fact that these oiseules were obstructing relief vehicles to stick pictures of the FatAss, is proof enough of the need for sweeping change."

Yes there was a small respite and exams went  on schedule much to the chagrin  of the students who hoped they would be postponed. Prof. Rayudu for DME?A UK/US professor wrote a very good book on designing for vulnerability with city flood case in particular. I  posted a link in the natural disasters releif thread in Tech Forum after UttaraKhand flood. Will post here also.  Basically  he says think  of your vulnerability. think  of your hazards. When a vulnerability meets a hazard it leads to a disaster.  So need to have a systematics study of all your vulnerabilities without ruling out any thing. Same with a listing of all your hazards and then do a matrix to see where the potential disasters can occur. He says most cost benefit studies are BS as one disaster will cost much much more than all the costs to prevent it. So better implement your proactive plan to mitigate the  disaster.My take is this applies to every situation in life and not just rural/urban planning.PS: Take care to complete the  full course of antibiotics."
348,SriKumar,07 Dec 2015 06:39 ,"This text is from the following article linked by SaiK. I thought it was worth posting the text directly in the thread.http://www.abplive.in/india-news/chenna ... els-255524Summary: One reason why areas far away from Adayar river got flooded (and the water did not drain away quickly)... The metro tunnel goes above ground near Saidapet bridge, right next to ADayar river. Once Adayar burst its banks, water went into metro tunnels and flowed along the tunnels into central parts of the city. (My kament: However, per this theory, only those areas/streets that are below Adayar river's  flood level would get flooded- with rain water AND river water.  So storm water drains will have a much larger amount of water to deal with, and if partially blocked, flood  water will take more time to drain).Chennai: Chennai’s floods had a secret weapon this time – the tunnels of the city Metro’s yet-to-be-operational underground section.Waters from the swollen Adyar and Cooum rivers found their way into these under-construction tunnels and inundated areas unaffected by previous floods, taking city planners and Metro engineers by surprise.A part of the Metro’s tracks leaves the underground section to climb onto the Saidapet bridge over the Adyar. So, when the river overflowed its banks, the big hole that was the Metro tunnel proved an entry channel.The water coursed through the tunnels right up to the heart of the arterial road, Anna Salai, where the approach for three Metro stations had been dug.For the first time, the central and south Chennai neighbourhoods of Alwarpet, Teynampet and T. Nagar were under sloshing rainwater.“Floodwaters in Chennai usually stagnate for a day but this time they have entered new areas and are staying put,” S. Ramakrishnan of Sriram Nagar observed.A senior railway official whose Alwarpet home is flooded, with his two cars submerged in the basement, said this had never happened before and the only reason could be the Metro tunnel.“Metro officials admitted they had not anticipated such a turn of events, since the Adyar’s earlier flood history showed it had swirled over the bridge only once in 1986, that too for just a few hours.”Residential areas like Anna Nagar and Shenoy Nagar, below which another underground segment of the Metro runs, too experienced floodwaters at doorsteps for the first time.A Metro engineer said a way had to be found to prevent a repeat that could prove disastrous once the underground section becomes operational.And this is that area where the tunnel goes above ground- right next to Adayar river.The flat 'road' on the left covered with flowing water is the Saidapet road bridge over Adayar. The above-water bridge on the right is the metro bridge. The far end of it is where water probably entered the metro system."

350,SSridhar,07 Dec 2015 06:50 ,"Coastal Tamil Nadu to stay mostly wet until weekend - Business LineThe southern parts of the peninsula, especially the South-East (Tamil Nadu) coast, are expected to see above-normal showers until this weekend.This is attributed to the presence of ‘low-pressure’ systems in the seasonal easterly winds across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, an outlook from the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology said.The above-normal showers would later become near-normal rains and hold on until December 11, up to which forecasts are available.Starting Sunday, this would represent an intermittently wet regime for the coast for the next five days.The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts too indicates the presence of a trough in the South-West Bay of Bengal for most of the time until December 16 up to which its forecasts are available.The presence of a trough is more than sufficient to maintain the easterly flows across coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and trigger rain or thundershowers.This was abundantly made clear during the two peak-rain periods of November 15-16 and December 2-3.Only, the intensity and the punishing nature of the spells would be missing in future appearances.Meanwhile, the Chennai Met Centre said that a rain-driving low-pressure area has moved entirely out from the South-West Bay of Bengal to the Comorin area.But the parent ‘trough’ (within which ‘low’s take birth) continues to make its presence felt in the South-West Bay, off the Tamil Nadu coast.

It was like the Iraqi joker who routinely gave news conferences about Baghdad being safe from AmirKhan troops, and the viewers could see rockets behind his shoulders.Now there is some news about TN obstructing the Army. I just hope MuKa and JJ never come near the power corridors for ever. Politicians are taking a big hit. Rajinikanth is taking a hit for not being visible. Lots of small time cine artists have become pillars of local community with their outreach. Kudos to them.Madras being a flat area requires good drainage to remove the used and excess water. Just like New Orleans drew attention because of one disaster, Madras has drawn attention about two broad areas of urban life in cities that have multi-millions.1. Urban planning & development.2. Disaster relief.In both cases, people do not have the best information to make sound decisions. Bangalore and Madras have known for decades that their water bodies have been disappearing. Neither the public nor the planners & politicians cared or could really do anything - especially with the abnormal growth of India in the last two decades. Marshes and low lying areas were converted to residential and commercial real estate properties. The population was sitting on a bumb that just had to be ignited. It did not require a 'natural calamity', a 'simple' rain that dumped 1 month's water on 1 day was enough to bring the system to a standstill. Once in a century event happened and grabbed the attention.These once in a lifetime or century events are occurring everywhere. With the huge population, if every region of the country sees even one such event, it brings takleef to millions in a jiffy. Madras has been lucky as cyclones dump Cuddalore/Pondicherry or Nellore/Ongle. We Madrasis were so relieved to see the cyclones missing us. I thought Neeya Nana program had the best discussion on the subject matter.  If this program is to be believed, only the new development areas were hit the max, the old parts of Madras did not suffer that much. While people wondered and criticized the people in America for living on coastal regions that had frequent hurricanes, or even scratched the nuts thinking why would New Orleans be built with all the weird engineering. What was the necessity, huh? Similar questions are not asked for the likes of Chennai.Heard Coovum is cleaner these days."

358,SSridhar,07 Dec 2015 09:05 ,"Why Chennai went down and under - Radhika Merwin, Business LineThe biggest reason for such damage was the excessive, unprecedented flow (over 80000 cusecs at times) in the Adyar river from the Chembarambakkam reservoir. The second and equally important reason was the encroachments on the Adyar and the various lakes in South & West Chennai regions. Dozens of lakes and their watershed areas have disappeared. In places where drainage does not exist, the ground had lost ability to absorb any more water because of the continuous wet spell for over a month. It has been raining since late October. This is the problem in these areas now because the water will take some time to drain now. They were showing on TV about how burials of dead bodies are difficult because water springs like a fountain even at two feet depth. Sitting ducksChennai is no stranger to heavy rains and cyclonic storms. The state of Tamil Nadu has been frequently subjected to cyclonic storms and flooding. The CAG report states that between 1900 and 2009, there were 50 cyclonic storms and, on an average, the State faces one or two severe cyclones during the northeast monsoon period. The low pressure and depression last for days, leading to heavy rainfall and flooding of vulnerable areas. It is inexcusable, then, that there was no disaster preparedness plan. According to the CAG report, the SDMA, constituted in 2008, did not meet even once, nor were State disaster management rules prepared.Even as Chennai city got some respite, there was excessive discharge of water from Chembarambakkam lake — the reservoir had been in surplus because of the heavy rainfall. The sudden discharge that came without warning displaced even more people from their homes. Much of the devastation and chaos could have been averted had the authorities altered the residents beforehand.One of the reasons why this may not have happened is because a large number of reservoirs and barrages in the country are not monitored at all for their water levels {That is not true for the Metrowaater lakes like Chembarambakkam. However, warning doesn't seem to have been issued in time. At the same time, water did not just hurt the people on the banks of the Adyar but also far away in the Airport, for example}. The CAG report states that only eight States out of 29 had prepared emergency action plans for 192 large dams as against a total of 4,728 large dams as of September 2011. The ministry of water resources had not formulated an actionable plan for the management of floods in accordance with NDMA guidelines. There were 4,728 reservoirs and barrages in the country as of September 2011. The Central Water Commission, responsible for conservation and utilisation of water resources in the States, provided inflow forecasts with respect to only 28 reservoirs and barrages.Ineffective responseLet us look at the response systems. It is true that the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) formed as a special force to deal with all types of disasters, has been initiating massive rescue operations in the last couple of days in Chennai. But despite such elaborate efforts, you still hear appalling stories of families stranded in their homes for days without food or water, with no rescue in sight. The answer may lie in the inadequate and ineffective resources of the NDRF.According to news reports, though there was a clear forecast of heavy rainfall, the State government requisitioned only a few teams of the NDRF. Had there been adequate forces, rescue operations would have been more effective. The shortage of manpower and inadequate specialised training are concerns that are highlighted in the CAG report. Also, the national policy on disaster management 2009 provided that the primary responsibility for disaster management rested with the States.Nothing’s unavoidableThe aim was for each State to equip and train one battalion equivalent force known as the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF). According to the CAG report, till June 2012, only seven States had set up the force — Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, J&K and Nagaland. The need for every State to have its own SDRF team in place is evident from the hurdles the NDRF teams are facing now in Chennai. As many of these teams were called in from the north, the Hindi-speaking personnel have been unable to communicate with distressed residents. Also, precious time was lost in understanding the topography and receiving logistical support from local agencies; this impeded rescue operations.Chennai and the 2013 disaster in Uttarakhand are clear wake-up calls. It is critical that effective disaster managing mechanisms are put in place to reduce the risks and damage from disasters to the maximum extent possible. See here for Lake levels"

367,SSridhar,07 Dec 2015 13:44 ,"Chennai’s wettest season comes in hottest year - Rukmini S, The HinduOn December 1, freak weather conditions all came together on one single day to swamp Chennai with the heaviest rainfall in a century. If that was bad news the worse is that it could all happen again. The World Meteorological Organisation has been producing regular updates on the scale of this year’s El Nino, and its expected impact was a significant contributor to the India Meteorological Department’s forecast of a deficient south-west monsoon, a forecast that was spot on.The same weather system was also expected to have an opposite impact on the north-east monsoon — the one that southern India experiences in its winter months — but the impact on the southern monsoon is much less clearly established, said G.P. Sharma, vice-president of meteorology with the private forecaster Skymet Weather.A positive Indian Ocean Dipole — warmer sea temperatures in the western Indian Ocean and a cooler eastern Indian Ocean — kept ocean temperatures high in the south Bay of Bengal resulting in strong weather systems in the South Andaman Sea, Skymet Weather assessed.What happened on December 1, however, when clouds dumped up to 490 mm of rain on parts of Chennai over 24 hours went beyond El Nino. El Nino affects the whole season and is not responsible for individual episodes of intense rain, according to B. Mukhopadhyay, additional director-general of meteorology (research), IMD (Pune). “An individual episode like that on December 1 is a combination of several factors and in every such episode, the combination changes. On December 1, the lower-level moisture supply was high and upper air evacuation of the moisture was also strong. We call this phenomenon upper air divergence, and the effect is that the cloud becomes very intense. Both coincide very rarely,” he said.At the same time, 2015 is on course to being the hottest-ever year recorded both globally, and as was recently confirmed by the IMD. The same holds for ocean temperature. The United States’ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has established that the Indian Ocean’s temperature in October 2015 was the record hottest.“One of the most confidently predicted consequences on warming land and oceans is an increase in evaporation that could provide more fuel for more intense rainstorms on land. The recent extreme rains in Chennai surely seem to fit that trend,” the U.S.-based meteorologist, Eric Holthaus, explained in an email to The Hindu .Such episodes of intense episodic rainfall are only going to become more frequent. In 2009, an Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology study found an alarming rise in the number and intensity of “extreme point rainfall events” and the 2011 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, too, predicted an increase in the probability of extreme weather events as a result of climate change.If these phenomena explain to some extent the intensity of the rainfall, the flooding is also substantially explained by the civic disrepair that has left nowhere for the water to go, and little means of conveying information.On December 2, PWD officials were releasing 30,000 cusecs {it became 80000 a day later} from the Chembarambakkam reservoir. Consequently, the Adyar was in spate, flooding most parts of the southern and even central parts of the city. PWD officials insist that the discharge was necessary as they could not afford to risk the safety of the reservoir.While the flooding of the southern parts is recurring during winter, the flooding in the heart of the city exposed the government’s unpreparedness in anticipating the floods based on water release into the Adyar and in disseminating information in advance for the residents to act.The worst affected were the southern suburbs that witnessed an unplanned real estate boom in the last decade with unapproved layouts springing up adjacent to wetlands and water bodies. Since the panchayats are unable to regulate unauthorised construction, residential development in low-level areas has mushroomed. Since the channels are also blocked, the inundation lasts longer.Some time ago, there was talk of delineating river corridors and mapping of flood plain zones to enable the residents to know the flood risk factor of their localities but it did not materialise.Added to this was the inadequacy of drains. Most parts of the old city were relatively safe from flooding this time. Of the Corporation’s area, the 172 sq.km of the old city have storm water drains while the remaining 254 sq.km have no storm water drains but only drains constructed by the local bodies that are not connected to the rivers.As of now, civic officials say the storm water drains could handle only 3 cm of rainfall an hour. With expertise from the Netherlands and other European nations, they are working on a design to handle 6.8 cm of rainfall. The city is also getting World Bank funding to the tune of Rs. 1,000 crore for developing watersheds in the Adyar and Cooum basins. Thirty-nine packages have been finalised, and work orders issued. Work on the Kosasthalaiyar and Kovalam basins has been delayed as no agency has come forward to fund the projects, officials say."

384,SSridhar,07 Dec 2015 19:32 ,"Airlifted pregnant woman delivers healthy twin girls - PTI A nine-month pregnant woman, who was aerially rescued last week from one of the worst rain-affected areas of the city, has given birth to healthy twin girls at a hospital here, bringing some cheer as residents grapple with the aftermath of the unprecedented deluge.The IAF, which had rescued 28-year-old Deepthi Velchamy on December 2, again airlifted her to a hospital two days later when she went into labour.She was initially evacuated from rain-hit Ramapuram area near Guindy and brought to the Tamabaram Air Base, nearly 30 kms from here, which served as one of the nodal points during the aerial rescue operations.“She was rescued on December 2 and was nine months pregnant. I was in Bangalore when I received a call and reached Tambaram the next day. She then went in labour and had to be airlifted again to a hospital in Chennai. The two girls were born on December 4,” her husband Karthik Velchamy told PTI.Deepthi went into labour but her pregnancy history papers were lost in the flood. The Velchamys, native of Hosur near Bangalore, were racing against time when the IAF came to their rescue again and airlifted her to a hospital which had her medical record.“She suggested (Sri) Ramachandra Medical College and Hospital as it had her details on onlinedatabase...And, an IAF team then airlifted her there. I am so happy that after all the hardships we went through, our daughters have arrived like angels and brought smile on everyone’s faces,” Karthik said.The Indian Air Force which played a stellar role during the entire rescue operations had saved three or four other expecting mothers.“Besides, Deepthi, who was airlifted from her house’s rooftop in Guindy area, by a ‘Cheetah’ helicopter, three-four other pregnant women were also rescued from the city and suburban areas, where communication links were cut off,” a senior IAF official told PTI.Sukanya (29), a seven-month-pregnant woman was rescued on December 3 along with her three-year-old child from her home in Medumbakkam, near Guindy, which bore the brunt of the torrential rains that has left the capital city battered.She was brought to Tambaram Air Base in a ‘Chetak’ helicopter, and then immediately taken to the Base Hospital.“We moved to the fourth floor of our house as the first and the second floor had become inundated. There was no electricity in our area for the last two days.“We had lost all hope until they rescued us,” she had said.“Rescuing is a tough job and when I heard our boys (pilots) are airlifting seven and nine-month pregnant women, I asked my colleagues, how are they doing it,” a top IAF official said.An emotionally overwhelmed Karthik is in awe of the IAF now, and says, “I salute these brave men.”"

411,kmkraoind,08 Dec 2015 11:43 ,"Chennai Rains: What The World Must Learn From IndiaA close friend living in the Silicon Valley was in panic because his wife and infant daughter were stranded in Chennai and were inaccessible. Their house was in a low-lying area. He went on the crowdsourcing site, picked up the number of a random person (a complete stranger) who he thought lived in the same area as his wife did, and called him. It was 1 a.m. in India.The stranger not only responded to the call but immediately offered to search for my friend’s wife and daughter and report back on their safety. He waded through chest-deep water, which was contaminated because sewer lines had burst open, for an hour to locate the woman and the infant. They were safe but were without milk and other necessities. He then again waded through sewage water located a pharmacy, got some dried milk powder and water bottles, returned and gave it to them. He had been soaking in sewage water for nearly four hours by then. He then called my friend to report on their safety. ....Hindu traditions have always taught that we are obligated to everyone else in this world. They called this obligation ṛṇa. An expression of charity, called dāna, is how ṛṇa is fulfilled. I can say with pride that Indians, regardless of how well-read or articulate they are, have internalized these great ideals. That is what inspires them to act spontaneously and selflessly when Mother Nature overwhelms our ephemeral existence.....Army officials remarked that Chennai is the only place where they saw more volunteers than victims!

Nagar in Perungudi was inundated, residents were at their wit’s end. The inundation was sudden. On Tuesday night, while the families were fast asleep, water levels had risen. On Wednesday morning, many woke up with flood waters gently washing over them.Many of the residents did not know where to turn for help.And so, they went about organising their own rescue. They took whatever junk material they could lay hands on – anything that would enable them to float to safety – and created their own rescue boats.They stuffed big polythene bags with discarded foam and empty plastic bottles and created their own floats. For people to sit on them, they appropriately placed planks underneath the polythene bags.It seemed to be a community effort with everyone pitching in with materials and time. After all, all of them wanted to get out of the locality which was hopelessly submerged.They started making the floats in the early hours of the day and soon had 25 of them, with which 70 percent of the locality were rescued. The sight of little children and senior citizens sitting on the floats as they were being pulled through the waters to safer ground attracted a sizeable crowd.Residents carried their pets and livestock out the locality. The local Thoraipakkam police offered their help in what was largely a community effort."

Venkataramanan of the Air Force, December 3 was yet another busy day flying sorties on Cheetah helicopter for rescue and airdropping relief material till Monday when they realised that a video of their rescue of a pregnant woman, who eventually delivered twins, went viral on the social media, earning them praises for a timely rescue.Recalling the challenging task, the pilots said they hovered the helicopter, placed one of the skids on top of a water tank on a building while rescuing the pregnant woman, who was already in labour pains.“We went there after getting instructions from our operations room. The challenge was that once we approached the spot in Ramapuram, there were over a thousand people on the terraces of many buildings and we could not spot her. NDRF personnel used a chair and helped her get on the chopper,” says Squadron Leader Venkataramanan, the co-pilot of the helicopter.Wing Commander C.S. Simon recalls the incident as “satisfying task” as it was a very important moment for the expectant mother. “We realised she could not walk and hence there was no way the waist strap could be fastened around her. It would have lead to miscarriage. So we decided to low-hover the aircraft.”Corporal Arun Singh and Corporal Rahul Kumar helped the pregnant woman get on the helicopter which helped her land in Tambaram Air Force Station. But her journey with the Air Force was not over yet.Roads cut off“She had to be rushed to Sri Ramachandra Hospital in Porur, but the roads were cut off. So we flew her to the hospital and landed on a basketball ground on the campus. It was actually a surprise for the hospital authorities to see a patient arrive by a helicopter,” recalls Mr. Venkataramanan.The pilots are happy to know that the woman was delivered of twins – both girls on Thursday. “Though it was an everyday incident to us, we are happy for the mother and the babies,” he said.The woman who was rescued on the day of her Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) was sent a gift by Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha on behalf of the Air Force, which was hand-delivered by the same pilots at the hospital on Monday."

Some of these instances have been captured on camera and have gone viral on social media drawing widespread condemnation from civil society.In one incident broadcast on Tamil television channels, including one channel which did not have any political affiliation, an AIADMK functionary and his accomplices, were seen intimidating volunteers from Bengaluru who were preparing food in Anna Nagar for distribution to the affected people.The functionary, identified as Ko Tamilselvam, demanded 2,000 packets of food from the volunteers, which he wanted to distribute to the local people. The volunteer refused to give in to the demand, which evoked angry reactions from Tamilselvam and his accomplices.The partymen dispersed only to return later on learning that the volunteers were distributing the food packets in the locality without inviting him. Tamilselvam is seen in the video mouthing expletives and moving menacingly towards the volunteers, who were visibly shaken by the political insensitivity of the men.In another video, circulated on social media, a bearded volunteer was accosted by a couple of men, one of whom claimed to be the husband of a councillor and demanded 2,000 food packets. When the volunteer demanded that they give their request it in writing and captured the scene on video, the two men beat a hasty retreat.Party's response“Media is being constantly misled. We have been guiding and helping the volunteers. How do we know that the claims made in the video are true? If it is proven true, the party high command will take severe action. The opposition parties are taking advantage of a crisis to take advantage politically,” a party leader contended."

423,SSridhar,09 Dec 2015 06:37 ,"Delay in opening sluice gates caused flooding - ToIThe flood that ravaged Chennai last week was not a natural disaster, but one caused by the state bureaucracy's failure to regulate release of water from Chembarambakkam reservoir (lake) in the outskirts of the city.Those privy to developments in the state secretariat during the last week of November say that in the wake of international weather forecast agencies predicting 500mm of rain for Chennai on December 1 and 2, public works department (PWD) officials had advised the PWD secretary and other senior bureaucrats on November 26 to bring down the water level in the reservoir from 22ft to below 18ft so the lake could absorb heavy inflow four days later. {Chembarambakkam was having 3140 Mcft of water against total capacity of 3645 Mcft on 26th November and the inflow was 2165 cusecs while outflow was slightly above at 2500 cusecs}There was not much rain between November 26 and 29 and Adyar river, too, which originates from this lake, had very little water.The proposal to release lake water was caught in bureaucratic red tape. Sources said the PWD secretary waited for chief secretary's nod to open the sluice gates — and whose nod the chief secretary was waiting for still remains a mystery. In effect, the disaster caused in Punjab by heavy release of water from the Bhakra Nangal dam two years ago was repeated in Chennai.Orders to open the Chembarambakkam sluice gates — rather flood gates — were not received till the city received was pounded with rain and the reservoir started overflowing. ""The state administration maintained that the release from the reservoir into Adyar river was only 33,500 cusecs (cubic feet per second; 1 cubic ft is 28.3 litres of water), which is the maximum capacity of the gates, from December 1 night onwards. But the actual release was more than double that, and nobody has any idea how much it was because water was overflowing from Chembarambakkam after the reservoir reached its full capacity of 24 feet. The problem was compounded as Athannur lake breached, releasing about 5,000 cusecs into the Adyar,"" said a highly placed source in PWD.In effect, Adyar was carrying more than one lakh cusecs of water on December 2 and 3, said a senior IAS official, who was coordinating rescue operations. ""The city has paid the price for having a bunch of bureaucrats who don't have the guts to act on their own. We were lucky that the reservoir, despite overflowing, did not breach,"" he said.""Flooding of Chennai and suburbs could have been averted by better management of water release,"" said Madras Institute of Development Studies professor S Janakarajan. The administration should not have viewed Chembarambakkam in isolation. The lake and Adyar river are connected to about 200 tanks, he said. Even if 33,500 cusecs had been released from Chembarambakkam, by the time the water reached Saidapet, it would have swelled to 60,000 cusecs because of additional flow from other water bodies enroute. The administration failed to gauge this and hapless people paid the price for it, he explained.Janakarajan said the government should view all water bodies, roughly 3,600 of them, in Chennai, Kancheepuram and Thiruvallur districts as one watershed as they are hydrologically connected to one another. ""If the government cleans up all those water bodies, they can hold about 30 tmcft (thousand million cubic feet) of water. Moreover, it will also prevent flooding in future,"" he said.The magnitude of the disaster was more because there was no advisory issued to people living in low-lying areas, warning them that their homes could get flooded. To add to the misery, Chennai city police officers were instructed to keep their cell phones switched off (much before mobile phone towers went down) and carry out all communications only through wireless sets. Hence, people in distress could not seek help by reaching out to officials in their locality.TOI's repeated efforts to get responses from the chief secretary and PWD secretary went in vain. Some pertinent questions that remain unanswered are: Whose orders were the bureaucrats waiting for to open the reservoir sluices? Will anybody be held responsible for the lapses? And, at least now, will the government put a standard operating procedure in place to keep reservoirs at safe levels? Will a better system be evolved to warn people living on river banks before gates are opened? "

433,chetak,09 Dec 2015 09:40 ,"SSridhar wrote:Delay in opening sluice gates caused flooding - ToIThe flood that ravaged Chennai last week was not a natural disaster, but one caused by the state bureaucracy's failure to regulate release of water from Chembarambakkam reservoir (lake) in the outskirts of the city.Those privy to developments in the state secretariat during the last week of November say that in the wake of international weather forecast agencies predicting 500mm of rain for Chennai on December 1 and 2, public works department (PWD) officials had advised the PWD secretary and other senior bureaucrats on November 26 to bring down the water level in the reservoir from 22ft to below 18ft so the lake could absorb heavy inflow four days later. {Chembarambakkam was having 3140 Mcft of water against total capacity of 3645 Mcft on 26th November and the inflow was 2165 cusecs while outflow was slightly above at 2500 cusecs}There was not much rain between November 26 and 29 and Adyar river, too, which originates from this lake, had very little water.The proposal to release lake water was caught in bureaucratic red tape. Sources said the PWD secretary waited for chief secretary's nod to open the sluice gates — and whose nod the chief secretary was waiting for still remains a mystery. In effect, the disaster caused in Punjab by heavy release of water from the Bhakra Nangal dam two years ago was repeated in Chennai.Orders to open the Chembarambakkam sluice gates — rather flood gates — were not received till the city received was pounded with rain and the reservoir started overflowing. ""The state administration maintained that the release from the reservoir into Adyar river was only 33,500 cusecs (cubic feet per second; 1 cubic ft is 28.3 litres of water), which is the maximum capacity of the gates, from December 1 night onwards. But the actual release was more than double that, and nobody has any idea how much it was because water was overflowing from Chembarambakkam after the reservoir reached its full capacity of 24 feet. The problem was compounded as Athannur lake breached, releasing about 5,000 cusecs into the Adyar,"" said a highly placed source in PWD.In effect, Adyar was carrying more than one lakh cusecs of water on December 2 and 3, said a senior IAS official, who was coordinating rescue operations. ""The city has paid the price for having a bunch of bureaucrats who don't have the guts to act on their own. We were lucky that the reservoir, despite overflowing, did not breach,"" he said.""Flooding of Chennai and suburbs could have been averted by better management of water release,"" said Madras Institute of Development Studies professor S Janakarajan. The administration should not have viewed Chembarambakkam in isolation. The lake and Adyar river are connected to about 200 tanks, he said. Even if 33,500 cusecs had been released from Chembarambakkam, by the time the water reached Saidapet, it would have swelled to 60,000 cusecs because of additional flow from other water bodies enroute. The administration failed to gauge this and hapless people paid the price for it, he explained.Janakarajan said the government should view all water bodies, roughly 3,600 of them, in Chennai, Kancheepuram and Thiruvallur districts as one watershed as they are hydrologically connected to one another. ""If the government cleans up all those water bodies, they can hold about 30 tmcft (thousand million cubic feet) of water. Moreover, it will also prevent flooding in future,"" he said.The magnitude of the disaster was more because there was no advisory issued to people living in low-lying areas, warning them that their homes could get flooded. To add to the misery, Chennai city police officers were instructed to keep their cell phones switched off (much before mobile phone towers went down) and carry out all communications only through wireless sets. Hence, people in distress could not seek help by reaching out to officials in their locality.TOI's repeated efforts to get responses from the chief secretary and PWD secretary went in vain. Some pertinent questions that remain unanswered are: Whose orders were the bureaucrats waiting for to open the reservoir sluices? Will anybody be held responsible for the lapses? And, at least now, will the government put a standard operating procedure in place to keep reservoirs at safe levels? Will a better system be evolved to warn people living on river banks before gates are opened? all the baboo(n)s, especially the much vaunted IAS types had simply vanished from the scene, abdicating all responsibility and leaving the battered citizenry to their fate. They seem good only for fair weather ""administration"" and their sense of entitlement is embedded deeply in their psyche.  They will surface now, as the sun starts to come out."

However, 72-year-old retired Lt.Col. G.Venkatesan had a tragic death along with his wife drowning inside his house after nine hours of struggle. Neighbours who heard them cry for help watched helplessly until their voice ceased to be heard. Venkatesan and his wife Geetha drowned inside their ground floor residence, “Geethalaya” in Defence officers colony in Ekkatuthangal, unable to get out of it.“It was Tuesday night (December 1). Heavy floods from the overflowing river started engulfing the colony and the water level started rising. Our family including three kids moved to the first floor as the water level was just below the first floor balcony,” J Sasikala, the army officer’s neighbour recalled.She and other neighbours could hear the cries of the elderly couple from their home, but none of them could help as the water was up to 10 feet high and rescue couldn’t reach in time.The next day, the cries were not heard and later the neighbours learnt that the couple had died inside their locked house. “It seems they couldn’t locate the door keys in the flood waters. I could hear him shouting over phone to his daughter until the mobile services eventually went off,” Sasikala said.A day later, rescue personnel recovered their bodies and moved them to the Government Royapettah Hospital. “The bodies were handed over to the couple’s daughter and son-in-law after autopsy,” police said.Nandambakkam Police Inspector Giri said patrol teams visited the residential areas and called out residents to vacate their houses the day it rained heavily. “The couple chose to remain inside,” he added.From what relatives later learnt from their daughter, Venkatesan got up on the dining table and then stood on a chair on the dining table shouting for help for several hours before the water levels rose to roof level drowning the couple.The couple’s last rites were held on Sunday.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Locked-at-home-Armyman-wife-died-sending-SOSs/articleshow/50099333.cms"

Along with him are 40 other volunteers, including some of the film school students, some volunteers and several actors who’ve constantly dropped by to support with aide. His mobile battery is down, for he’s been spending a major part of his time in the last few days coordinating with actors and volunteers, for the ‘Mana Madras Kosam’ initiative organised by the Telugu film fraternity.“Anything and everything ranging from biscuit packets, water, rice and dal is what we’re ensuring in the form of kits. For those who want to donate monetarily, we’ve specified account numbers, so that, our team can buy what’s required. There’ve been equal help from both fronts. It’s been going on for the last five days,” reveals Venkat. Though many people have lined up for contributions, both in terms of goods and money transfers, the issue has been the amount of used clothes they’ve received and can’t distribute. “The ones who’re helping should imagine themselves in the shoes of the affected. Moreover, with time, the need for more blankets, medicines, sanitary napkins and undergarments have risen. These were dimensions people couldn’t anticipate in their donations. Still there’s time and it’ll be a good sign to see these accessories reach us too,” he adds.The cause taken up by the Telugu film industry has earned support and accolades from several quarters. While some people have conveyed their support on social media platforms, an impressive lot was also in action to garner all their resources together from their part. Technicians and actors, including the Rana Daggubati, Nani, Samantha, Allari Naresh, Allu Arjun, Kajal Aggarwal, Rakul Preet, Madhu Shalini, Lakshmi Manchu and Navdeep have been flocking malls to ensure crowd support.“It was a tough fact to digest, that we are so comfortable on one end and in another place, they’re battling for life, living without electricity, food, shelter and proper connectivity. Social media was a boon for people reacted so soon to what we initially thought was a small idea. To pull in a crowd of 15,000 on a Sunday was no small task. When we realise, anything from a candle to a match box to a mosquito repellent is needed, it is important that people chip in,” says actress Madhu Shalini, who reveals a part of Chennai always resides in her heart. She too had a nerve-wracking wait to know the whereabouts of her friend who was travelling from Tirupathi to Chennai until she got to know, he was safe.

446,SaraLax,09 Dec 2015 17:28 ,"Couple of articles on the dangerous effort of rescuing patients using boats at the heavily flooded Global Hospitals, Perumbakkam, Chennai. Truly nightmarish situation for the people who had to undergo this experience including the patients themselves.3 dangerous things happened during these lake breach type water flooding incidents and this affected hospitals, mobile network connectivity & etc - Long duration power supply disconnect (for safety reasons) &- simultaneous heavy flooding disabling the diesel gensets used to power the crucial medical equipments at the hospital & - floods preventing normal movement of diesel/petrol fuel between refinery/depot & vending fuel bunks - leading to lack of fuel for powering the emergency gensets at various establishments.This is a well known hospital nearby the IT corridor of the city and receives many international patients from Africa. Maybe the fact that this same  hospital was flooded just a couple of weeks earlier in NOV-2015 might have helped them & remain aware of the possibilities for manifestation of the worst case lack-of-power scenario. The mobile network was also flaky at this time and soon after went out in these areas (again due to flooded gensets, used as fallback power supply for mobile base stations, seemingly placed at heights which were not safe enough for this type of lake breach caused flooding & in other cases - eventually running out of diesel fuel). I know this well - because i faced between 4 & 5 days of continuous power outage at my locality (a centrally located place in south chennai with all support facilities nearby) and the water logging still continues at my area just under 2 ft level.This hospital is in a former lake bed area and the nearby lake breached during the heavy rains last week. Apparently during the flood, the water level was 8 feet outside of the hospital and around 3 feet inside the Hospital itself. They had to use boats to ferry out ICU patients on ventilators for more than 2  KMs amidst heavy rain to Ambulances and then got them shifted to nearby safer hospitals. Trapped in a watery hell: What it was like to be stuck during the Chennai floods...As soon as we moved out from the hospital portico, the rain and cold wind hit us hard. I was holding the umbrella over my mother's head, but the rain was ruthless. We were all soaking wet and had to travel nearly 2.5 kms on that boat to get to safety. The men navigated the waters carefully so as not to hit electrical posts, open wires, hard objects or anything else that could fatally injure any of us or leave us stranded in the water. The water depth had to be constantly monitored by men navigating the bot. We saw an ambulance, a water lorry and numerous vehicles sitting in eight feet of water as we moved out of the hospital gates. The area around the hospital is marshy and through the rain and cold we crossed the water body slowly. We actually rode on roads that were inundated in more than five feet of water and saw many homes submerged. There was not a single soul in sight. and the areas were uncannily eery and deserted. That 15-minute ride was perhaps one of the longest ones in my life. I kept asking every few minutes when we would reach safety.Finally at 3 pm, we reached land, after a struggle of over seven hours. But our ordeal wasn't over yet.​ As soon as got to the Shollinganallur signal, the men quickly helped us out as they needed to go back and fetch more patients. We had been told at the hospital that there were two ambulances and a jeep there, that would help us reach home.... As per the news article - the State Health Minister Dr.C.Vijayabhaskar and the State Health Secretary Dr.J.Radhakrishnan were at the location (some 3 Kms away from this Hospital due to heavy flooding !) monitoring the rescue of all the ICU patients in this hospital. A VIDEO of the rescue efforts at the flooded Global Hospitals, Perumbakkam in Chennai.Another article from The HINDU :  Patients evacuated from Global Hospitals in Perumbakkam..Ashwin Sridhar, chief nuero-surgeon at the hospital, said some parts of it had 12 feet of water...But unfortunately at the same time - they couldn't prevent the tragedy at MIOT Hospital, Manapakkam at Ramapuram (another area built on lake bed) where 18 patients died due to lack of power for ventilator (57 ICU patients were rescued though).In this case - the ultimate worst case 'lack-of-power-for-operations' scenario played out for real and some hospitals were found lacking a proper solution (a'la Fukushima Nuke Plant Disaster where a combination of Earthquake lead Grid Power Disconnect & Tsunami lead Diesel Genset Flooding - caused the nuclear meltdown at the power plant). Maybe keeping the Diesel Gensets at a height which is very very safe from flood water might have helped.  Is this a plausible solution ??  Makes me wonder how the other flooded hospitals (along with their ICU patients) lying in low level areas of Chennai during this same flood coped with heavy flooding at the same time as power supply disconnect and still managed to not get affected in this manner. Some hospitals might well have been purely lucky !!. So much real world knowledge, info & safety strategies adopted at various hospitals to handle this adverse operational scenario - might well be out there, waiting to get tapped & recorded & analysed & implemented for the future."

The WRD has all the data and should have been aware of the overall picture. We know pretty well that the WRD officials are generally lax in their approach to work as we have seen in the Porur lake encroachment issue or the encroachments of other water bodies too. Two, the chain of command failed. According to the ToI report, the Chief Secretary was waiting to take the decision, possibly expecting the orders from somebody above him. In my employment, if I go to my boss for things which I have to take a decision on, I would not only get chided but I can expect no career progress, or worse still, adverse action. If you listened to these ministers who were interviewed on the channels during the relief operations, they would start off by saying, ""As per Amma's orders, we are doing . . . ."" etc. This is ridiculous that Amma has to order everything that falls within the normal job responsibilities of officers or ministers.

All systems have a finite capacity, and some flooding will happen if that's exceeded. The key at that point is to ensure the water drains quickly. And that's what Chennai should focus on. As someone said earlier on this thread  (SSridhar sir, I think), the built up houses have done the damage, they won't be reclaimed. So flooding will need to be dealt with - by adding a lot more flood channels and mapping out the flood prone areas and informing people, so some of them can choose to stay elsewhere. I had commented on this earlier (viewtopic.php?p=1944712#p1944712).Also, reviving and completing this project will help a lot:CAG says flood protection schemes in Chennai ‘largely not achieved’ - ToI, Dated Aug 2014   A shortcut diversion channel from Buckingham canal near Okkiyum Maduvu to the sea, as originally proposed, would have drained flood water (3,500 cubic feet per second) in no time and saved south Chennai from floods. But the state government had dropped the work due to increase in land acquisition cost involving Rs 100 crore, said a CAG report tabled in the assembly on Tuesday.Citing lapses in several projects, the report said defective planning of flood control projects in Chennai led to delay and increased cost, thereby defeating the very objective of the scheme formulated to avoid flooding in Chennai. ""The fact remains that alleviation of inundation of flood water in Chennai city remains largely unachieved,"" the CAG report said, adding that the state had incurred an expenditure of Rs 394.53 crore for this till September last.The previous UPA regime sanctioned Rs 633.03 crore under JNNURM to improve macro drainages in Chennai as part of flood alleviation programme. The flood protection schemes were envisaged in ten packages along South Buckingham canal, North Buckingham canal and Central Buckingham canal.Had the short cut diversion channel, conceptualized in 2009, been in place, Okkiyam Maduvu near Sholinganallur would have been linked to the sea, via south Buckingham canal, Injambakkam and ECR, precisely meant to resolve the huge time consumption taken to discharge major portion of flood water in the present system.Currently, the flood water from Velachery, Madipakkam, Ullagaram, Puzhuthivakkam, Pallikaranai and Kovilambakkam is discharged into Pallikaranai marsh and Okkiyam Maduvu, from where it flows into Buckingham Canal and finally into the sea. The 'in fall' point in the backwaters of Muttukadu lake is 16 km from Okkiyam Maduvu, and the time taken to discharge flood water is more than 10 days, sources say. It was to reduce this time that the new channel was proposed as the sea is only 1.7km from Okkiyam Maduvu.Similarly, improvement to Veerangal Odai drain intended to mitigate flooding in Velachery and surrounding areas could not be completed, due to land acquisition. Only 677m flood protection wall was constructed to drain surplus of Veerangal Odai, while the plan was to build 8 km long wall. Flood protection work in Central Buckingham canal, sanctioned in 2010, too could not be completed due to delay in eviction of encroachments and finalization of alignment, the CAG report said.Despite presence of multi-storeyed structures of Tamil Nadu slum clearance board and heavy encroachments in work site, a drain work was taken up to divert surplus from Maduravoyal tank to Cooum river to mitigate heavy flooding in Virugambakkam-Arumbakkam drain. To sum up, flood control works in Chennai city, a joint venture of the state and central government under JNNURM, were still to commence in three out of ten packages. ""In other seven packages, completion of works in near future appears remote, pending revised administrative sanction from the government,"" the CAG report said.The government in its reply said that works under three packages of JNNURM which were not taken up were likely to be dropped and the remaining works would be completed on receipt of revised administrative sanction and after shifting of service utilities. There are some reports that the Kanchipuram district collector has swung into action and has issued eviction notices to people living on some lake beds in her area of responsibility. She was also one of the proactive officials involved in flood related relief. I hope she is allowed to do her work without transfers, but who knows?"

In fact even Bangalore, as a result of the same storm system received more rain in November than ever before in recorded history.What this means is that Chennai is not going to have rains anything like this for another century. There is some chance of something like this occurring again in the next decade. So it is other cities that have to prepare. because some other city will get hit and we will have a repeat of these recommendations. Chennai will recover but I predict that this sort of event will not recur for a long loooong time. Someone leave a message for me here if this is wrong.

483,SSridhar,10 Dec 2015 16:27 ,"A wrong call that sank Chennai - S.Ramani & V.Srinivasan, The Hindu As the flood water recedes in Chennai, serious questions are being raised about reservoir management in the city. Much of the flooding and subsequent waterlogging was a consequence of the outflows from major reservoirs into swollen rivers and into the city following heavy rains. The release of waters from the Chembarambakkam reservoir in particular has received much attention.Official data from the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board for the last 20 days suggest that the high precipitation and reservoir outflows on November 16 and December 1 respectively were primarily responsible for swelling the rivers. On November 17, 18,000 cusecs was released from the reservoir in Chembarambakkam.However, from November 24 to November 30, when the city experienced minimal rainfall, the outflows from the reservoir were limited, even as the storage levels were maintained at almost 85-88% of the total capacity of 3645 mcft. When heavy rains to the tune of nearly 48 cm fell on the reservoir on December 1, 29,000 cusecs was released over 12 hours.Experts raise the question as to why storage was set at such high levels. Professor Janakarajan of the Madras Institute of Development Studies also argues that the outflow management from the reservoir was improper. If storage levels were set at less than 75% and sluice gates were opened to allow for outflow from the reservoir in a way that it exceeded the inflows in the last week of November, the blow in the form of the high outflow on December 1 could have been softened, he asserts.Officials formerly with the PWD say if the risk of releasing a particular volume prior to the heavy rainfall day had been taken, there would have been lesser floods in places like K.K.Nagar.It is reliably learnt that the government is considering a move to further reduce the set storage level in the reservoir. Now the level is at two feet below the brim, and discussions are under way to change this to four feet.Reservoir managers ignored warnings of heavy downpourOn November 17, 18,000 cusecs was released from the reservoir in Chembarambakkam, causing massive flooding in areas such as Mudichur, West Tambaram, and Manapakkam among others.However, from November 24 to November 30, when the city experienced minimal rainfall, the outflows from the reservoir were limited. Officials in the Public Works Department asserted that the inflow of 31,000 cusecs (26,000 before 6:00 p.m. owing to the high rainfall) resulted in the high outflow of 29,000 cusecs from the reservoir on December 1 and that they couldn’t hold the reservoir beyond a point.Former officials of the department, however, said if they had taken the risk of releasing a particular volume from the reservoir prior to the heavy rainfall day, water received from some tanks like Porur and Mudichur could have been stored.The decision to conservatively hold storage despite early warnings from various meteorological agencies about heavy rainfall in the offing in late November and early December, clearly exacerbated the disaster that followed.This was in addition to the structural issues in Chennai with floodplains and drainage systems being constrained by unplanned urbanisation.Storage levels in Chembarambakkam and other reservoirs are decided based on drinking water requirements for the city and other areas in summer.That the authorities should have hedged on the side of flood management over concerns on drinking water is now evident in hindsight. "
484,SSridhar,10 Dec 2015 16:34 ,"Overflowing drain, not Adyar, flooded airport - V.Ayyappan, ToILast week, as planes floated around the flooded airport, Airports Authority of India officials thought the rising River Adyar nearby was the culprit. The real cause, some airport staff say, was that a drain linking Pallavaram with the Adyar (see pic) was filled with water from surrounding areas and, through openings on the tarmac, inundated the operation area. Along came tonnes of garbage.Airlines officials and other staff at the airport have for years been urging the AAI to talk to the local body concerned and get the drain sealed off. Many such drains, designed to carry rain water from Pallavaram, Meenambakkam and nearby neighbourhoods, run across the airport campus.The airport was flooded, AAI officials assumed, because of the second runway built across the river. In reality, water from the drain overflowed on to the taxiway, runway and apron in front of international terminal at the time the Adyar overflowed.Airport staff watching the water level in front of the international terminal rise said it was flowing from the Pallavaram-end of the main runway to the end where the domestic terminal is located. Water flowed into the basement of the terminals.""It was flowing slowly like a river flooding the entire area used for operating planes. The drifting garbage showed that the water was flowing from Pallavaram side. The water broke the compound walls and flowed into Adayar river,"" said an airport staffer.Drains connected to the airport proved risky, he added. ""Water from neighbourhoods entered the airport through the drains."" Airlines and other stakeholders have for long been saying that a permanaent solution is to close the drain.An AAI official admitted that the existing drains proved useless as the water level around the airport was high. ""Construction of the second runway over the river also led to the flooding. The river was outside the airport before the runway was extended,"" he added.However, getting the local body to close the drain from Pallavaram might be difficult as it is the only way to discharge rainwater into the river.After the floods, Union minister of civil aviation Ashok Gajapathy Raju said inspections and studies would be done to prevent such a situuation. ""We have received inputs from local officers,"" he added.Sources said the Adyar was also affected because of the airport expansion.""The runway across it constricted the river's flow leading to flooding in neighbouring Manapakkam and other areas.Airport raised the height of the runway near the river to prevent flooding but no one anticipated that water would enter from Pallavaram."" Inundation of the airport was also because water flowed in from the metro rail worksite at the Hotel Trident end of the secondary runway and could not flow out.Airport director Deepak Shastri said the drains could not be closed because the design was based on the geography of the area. ""We are planning to conduct a study to take steps to ensure that the drains do not overflow. We will also prepare a fresh outlet programme for neighbouring areas.Additional drains will also be built."" "

In the immediate aftermath of the floods, the team set up a community kitchen which scaled up every day to reach out to the distressed Chennai residents. Here are some of her experiences.Chennai’s VolunteersThey came in droves to volunteer. They knocked on doors to collect newspaper for packing! They vowed to not clog up drains with plastic or rubber bands and learnt the art of packing in dried leaves and newspaper. They set up assembly line processes and quality control. They made new friends, formed teams and stayed on their feet. They picked up brooms to sweep away water with every new bout of rain. They picked up trash and washed huge vessels. They took delivery of groceries and kept tabs on gas cylinders. They formed teams to do real-time surveys of the affected areas and came back, distressed, to ask for food to be distributed. They waded through water and delivered food. They loaded and unloaded trucks and drove their vehicles to deliver. They heaved a sigh of relief when we announced that an ambulance had reached a woman in labour. They reached out to all their overseas friends’ parents and helped evacuate them. They smiled and joked through their tiredness and never failed to check reporting time for next day.The cooks maintained an amazing quality of good throughout the ordeal. The volunteers packed and packed. An incredible pace was set. Every dispatch became a milestone to celebrate. The volunteers came in such large numbers that we set up a second kitchen to achieve the large requirement. We vowed to not turn down any request for food (although I did turn down a woman from a political party who demanded we supply for her division: I reasoned with her that priority was to send to the farthest and most affected point. I said we would visit and check her area out. She wanted to know how we were unwilling to give importance to this division. I said that we are citizens of Chennai and we have no divisions. Our volunteers calmly served her tea. After watching us work for a while, the group left.).I am stunned, moved by the way that people came together, extraordinary feats of service, seeking no acknowledgement. People cooked for their neighbours and shared their homes. Large establishments opened their doors to the public. Individuals walked in to donate without even bothering to give their names. The anger and scepticism in me against the political class and the media faded into the background as I delighted in the people around me. People of Chennai, you are a class act!Related read- What it's really like to deliver aid in a disaster zoneA Day in the LifeAt four in the morning, the burners come alive and the cooks start another day. Two kitchens. By seven, the volunteers trickle in. The phone does not stop ringing, the requests start pouring in. Can we meet this volume?  A team starts flashing messages for more volunteers. Is it really a Sunday? Packing begins in earnest. We run out of stitched dry leaves. A volunteer takes charge and networks madly. Another runs to procure green banana leaves. A new process begins. They are cleaned and cut in size. A new assembly station is set up.People walk in with newspapers, cars drive in with cardboard boxes. Finally, some good news: twenty thousand dried packing leaves have been sourced and will reach us in an hour. We multiply provision requirements. Suppliers are made to open up shops. Random calculations are made and ordered. A team chases up supplies while my warriors pack with single-minded devotion.All of a sudden, the rains begin again. Volunteers squeeze under tents. Umbrellas and plastic sheets are used to cover packed food. They move swiftly to the dispatch team. I pray that they do not slip. But these kids are amazing, they adapt in minutes. The rains are no constraint. Being drenched seems normal. Cars and tempos arrive to pick up food in batches of 3000, 500, 2000 to Korattur, Pallikaranai, Tsunami Nagar. Names and quantities blur.Volunteers ply raw materials to the second location where work is on at an unbelievable pace. Hundreds of bubbletops are filled with water for cooking and drinking. Prominent Carnatic artistes walk in. It is December after all! But they have a new stage. We dump supplies into their cars and they rush to deliver them. They load and unload with an easy rhythm. A breakfast counter is set up serving upma for the third day in a row. Hot tea is served. A cheer erupts: five thousand packed and delivered!Soon, it resembles a war zone. Chlorine tabs all around to sanitise, volunteers pulled out for tetanus shots, everyone is making friends. Neighbours team up to cook food that arrives in large containers: ‘Can you please include these?’ they ask. Organisations cook food in their canteens and ask us to collect. All of a sudden, we discover that we have delivered twenty thousand packets.The press walks in. ‘How did you put together this scale?’ they ask, and we have no answer. The senior gentleman and the ten-year-old girl continue through the day. A new small team of cooks arrive, we increase capacity. A strategic alliance is struck between the cooks. There are purchase teams, supply chains, logistics committees.Calls pour in from Mylapore, cooks wanting to join this massive effort. Team leaders walk around urging people to make as large an individual packing as possible. Individuals feeding families around them are desperate for food packages to arrive, as their gas supplies at home have run out and they cannot let down people waiting for them. We cannot say no! We urge people calling in for small deliveries to get neighbourhood apartments to cook and pool. Numbers are tallied, stocks are reviewed. We realise we have delivered forty-five thousand! There’s mad cheering. The cooks are embarrassed with a standing ovation.The final pick-up team fails to arrive. It is too late in the night to create alternate delivery. We are all feeling wretched about wasting food and the volunteers’ efforts. A call comes in from a distressed software professional having visited a slum where no food had gone. We ask her if she wants to come and take the packets now. This incredible couple arrives in their small car. The car becomes as large as their hearts as the food is piled in. They thank us with tears in their eyes. Meanwhile, our volunteers search on social media. A request pops up. Volunteers load the food in their vehicles. No one seems to be in a hurry to go home.Scaling UpThe core team at Bhoomika begins a dual operation plan: rescue and rehabilitation. Overnight, a new control centre is created with all operations under one roof. We move into a large wedding hall. Volunteers furiously share the new venue details. There’s no time to analyse why requests are not coming down. As young professionals return to work, new volunteers arrive. Who are these young smart girls with clipped accent who effortlessly blend with a team of drivers and helpers, carrying boxes with ease and heading into suburbs? Chennai girls!The water has still not drained in many parts of the city. More news of electrocution accidents trickles in. We are too numb to react. Stories and visuals of homes are shared. People experience the horror of returning to devastated homes. A lifetime’s accumulation of possessions stands destroyed. How can this new section of self-made middle-class individuals, which is not used to taking charity from anyone, come to terms with this reality? Heartbreaking!Massive rehabilitation will have to begin. Let us now unite and create, let us question and demand, let us vow to not support this unimaginable level of plundering of our ecology and our resources for this thoughtless, mindless growth. Let us not forget the lessons learnt.Read- Chennai Floods: The worst might be over, but keep diseases at bay with these health tipsThe next phaseHow does one know when to stop? How much is enough?After seven days, we made the decision to close down our community kitchen, which was churning out thirty to forty thousand food packets a day. This was not based on any clear understanding of what was required at the ground level. We were told by the government that food would be provided to those still in relief centres.The incredible number of volunteers who kept arriving at our centre cannot be categorised. I will only call them ‘people of Chennai’. No, even that is not correct. A group arrived from Kodaikanal to volunteer. Groups of expats from all over the world stood shoulder-to-shoulder and learnt to pack.Chennai’. No, even that is not correct. A group arrived from Kodaikanal to volunteer. Groups of expats from all over the world stood shoulder-to-shoulder and learnt to pack.‘Let's get everybody back home, let's get them back to their vocation,’ is our new mantra.A huge team is at work sorting and packing dry rations so that people rebuilding their homes have some basic necessities to start with. The process is complex, but our team, with its seven days of non-stop work experience, has a solution for everything: more work stations to make individual packs from large sacks; rice, dal, tamarind, spices, consolidated into a single pack; a human chain to move packed stuff from packing to storage!Supplies of provisions are continuously being sourced. Trucks arrive and move out. Logistics of reaching out and delivering are being planned. Our planning team has now quit the conference room. Sleeves have been rolled up. Decisions are being made in minutes. Bringing in NGOs on the ground, small volunteer groups from different parts of the city, we are encouraging the adoption of smaller areas to help with outreach. The logistics are mindboggling.We create a team of boys and girls in a devastated area on the banks of the Adyar River and bond them with a small team of our volunteers. They slip into easy camaraderie: ‘bro’ becomes ‘anna’. They huddle together to look at pictures of their now destroyed homes, listening to experiences. Our volunteers are determined to get them back home. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: I love you, young men and women of Chennai.The larger reality hits us. All the tenements on the canal banks and riversides need to be resettled. These homes are already non-existent as we see small walls here and there, some flooring and no roofs. The destruction is total. I cannot even imagine the emotional trauma of losing a home, much less a forced relocation. We do not even know how all this is going to happen. Is the onus to be on our state government? There has been no news.The more fortunate residents, the business people, walk into our relief centres, giving us stories of devastation near their homes. They are now emotionally connected with the neighbours they had never met before. These tenements have become their family as they have provided milk for the children, taken care of the old and the pregnant. We tell them to come back with the youth from these tenements, we promise to give them guidance and support.In walks 2015 Magsaysay award winner Anshu Gupta of Goonj and our jaws drop! “You are doing outstanding work,” he tells us, “and I am here for you people.” They have organised truckloads of delivery material. More importantly, they have experience in working in devastated zones. It looks insurmountable, the challenge of cleaning up, building new homes, healing people and rescuing Chennai from greed.But if there’s one thing I know, it’s this: we will overcome because Chennai cares."

508,Comer,13 Dec 2015 18:48 ,"http://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/S89Vf ... rescu.htmlYet, the story of the latest flood is not a simple linear narrative of callous government officials, poor urban planning and marvellous self-organizing social media-driven help networks. As with most things in India, it’s complicated.In September, the local folks in the Public Works Department decided to do something uncommon. Their job. They desilted every storm drain, elevated every street and, amazingly enough, collaborated with another government department, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board.Almost every junction box was raised to keep it above water level in case of floods. These were model local government employees, that kind that most people in India assume do not exist."
509,Javee,13 Dec 2015 18:53 ,"TNEB has already proposed (before the Deepavali rains) to increase the height of the junction box - They cited 3 problems, flood, being an eye sore and to free up the pavement for walkers."

The team conducted 126 separate missions over 12 days to capture oblique imagery, video, and ortho-mapping. The Indago’s flexibility and small logistics footprint allowed Heliwest to deploy a full system while remaining mobile on police patrol boats, zodiacs, quadbikes, cars, and regional flights and light helicopters.This is possible for a new chennai.

512,Philip,14 Dec 2015 12:20 ,"This is a disaster that will take the city a few years to recover from. The massive infrastructural work to be done,and which should be perfectly done,not of the current corrupt quality,will require huge funding. Resettlement of slum dwellers living near riverbanks and tanks will also require new land areas for their accommodation, which again must be flood free! Restoring the hydrological network that once existed is another issue,as what do you do with the huge concrete jungle sitting in the low-lying areas  on what was once the flood plains? The topography of Chennai/Madras is such that such excessive rainfall has nowhere else to go if it cannot be fed into the sea asap. Neither of the two Dravidian parties have any integrity,as stories of their rampant corruption is rife. From reports emanating from Chennai,criticism is open and mounting from the ""man in the stream"".All Amma's freebies like TVs,mixies,etc. have been washed away by the waters.Thousands of Families have lost everything.There will be a gradual exodus from Chennai/Madras of those able to do so while while the rest will have to literally weather the storm.Ironically,it is the old town area of erstwhile Madras that ha survived the deluge,and therein lies the answer.The British Empire built the infrastructure well to benefit the people,while our post-Independence leaders have built empires for themselves."
513,UlanBatori,14 Dec 2015 12:30 ,"Oh, well... the british probably stole the high land and left the natives to build in the floodplains as development progressed. Pretty standard practice, hain? They could dredge the Cooum and Buckingham canal to enable swift drainage to the sea."
514,Javee,14 Dec 2015 15:23 ,"If people start leaving the city for floods then Mumbai should've been empty before Chennai. Industry in Chennai exist for a reason and I'm sure the floods have not wipe off that yet.Actually, part of the reason why the Cooum needs constant dredging is because of the existence of Chennai/Ennore port. Here is something I read sometime back,The  coastline  behaviour  in  the  Chennai-Ennore reach   has   revealed   many   important   aspects.   For example,  the  effects  like  formation  of  an  extensive beach    on   the    south   side    (Marina    beach)    and progressive   erosion   and   eventually   formation   of Royapuram  Bay  has  been  well  documented  in  the coastal  engineering  literature  more  than  50  years back.  The formation  of  a beach on the south  side  has been    used    with    advantage    for    various    urban developments  and  the  region  has  been  the  pride  of Chennai  City.  Even  the  formation  of  the  Royapuram Bay, which had been of concern, has been eventually used   for   extension   of   major   port   and   for   the development of fisheries harbour with minimal capital dredging.  However,  it  is  well  known  that  severe erosion  has  resulted  in  the  northern  reaches  up  to Ennore,  which  has  aggravated  over  the  years  despite some local protection works.  The   Marina   beach   had   beneficial  effects   of providing  vast  additional  land  area  for  urban  use. However   it   is   adversely   affecting   the   hydraulic exchange mechanisms in the Cooum River, which has been a sore feature in the region. Progressive seaward advancement  of  the  Marina  beach  has  aggravated  the Cooum   river   problem.  In   the   year   2000-2001, construction  of  groyne/training  jetty  of  150  m  length on  the  south  side  of  the  Cooum  river  has  not  only aggravated  the  choking  of  the  river  inlet  but  also  has caused erosion in some reaches of the Marina beach.http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/12 ... 97-604.pdf"
515,SaiK,14 Dec 2015 15:54 ,"I don't see people begin thinking about proactive models for future. I see some corrections like amma taking steps for greed, but I am pretty positive this desire to correct will fade away as things dry up when Sun hits every sand particle to 60*c.comprehensive correction is needed. desilting lakes and dredging rivers, connecting them where required, destroying properties on low-lying areas, and moving over to a new city."

520,SaiK,15 Dec 2015 03:42 ,"He describes with technical details about various waterways that lead to the sea, and those important lakes for catchment and existing canals that connect them. We all know what happened as well as the core issues about how rain dump was blocked. As a responsible citizen, think about this water system and keep it clean, not-encroached, and dump waste into it [He didn't mention industrial waste though]. GoTN cares a hoot for solving, but it is you Chennai-wasis who are affected and not GoTN. So, act on preserving the water system. Just imagine the state of Chennai, consuming all these rain water dumps without the existing waterways!I would guess Chennai would be 20' down!"
521,Philip,15 Dec 2015 13:36 ,"UB.Old Madras had the Brits living in the Fort and surroundings,nice garden areas with tree-lined avenues. Madras once used to be called the garden city.Trams plied their way to the harbour and Beach rly station.The ""natives"" lived in ""Black Town"",later called ""George Town"".This is the heart of old Madras ,adjoining the harbour,the High Court complex,parry's Corner,GPO,Burma Bazaar and the old business district.Quaint old street names like Armenian St.,Mint st.,etc. It is this most crowded,congested area of old Madras which has survived the floods splendidly. Historic central madras has had little damage,but the floodplain construction ,modern ""Chennai"",is of the last decade,thanks to ravenous greedy builders,politicos and babus.who disregarded topography and failed to build the infrastructure to carry storm water safely away to the sea from these areas.Chennai as it is now,is one mighty mess. Since flooding and most of teh city under water going to be and annual feature of the metro from now on,with making the city water and flood proof an almost impossible task to overcome,why can't the planners take a new approach and imagine that the city is now S.India's equivalent of Venice! instead of the polluting city buses,Chennai could have waterbuses-vaporettos instead,gondoliers too! This would be a great tourist attraction. Imagine turbaned Tamil gondoliers in their colourful lungis belting out the yesteryear hits of MGR movies.! There was a great pic doing the rounds of tycoon AC Muthiah sitting in a boat accompanied by his entourage. People could emulate him.This could trigger off a whole new industry,boats,instead of cars. Like Bangkok,or Dal lake,floating bazaars and vendors would sail past houses and condos,selling their wares. Madras airport could easily operate seaplanes when flooded. What a great opportunity presents itself."
522,Javee,15 Dec 2015 16:39 ,"Old Madras survived because Cooum was not flooded not because of the British planning. In fact circa 1902 or there abouts the flood waters have touched then Central Station and flooded all the way to half of what we call now as Mount road. I think we need to start thinking on a large scale operation  in terms of New Orleans, Kuala Lumpur or Rotterdam /Amsterdam types. Unlike those cities, I still do think Chennai has a solid base in terms rivers and canals, as long as we don't destroy them any further."
